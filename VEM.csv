SriLankanEnglish,may,The guilty secret may also make them feel worthless which results in shame,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,<ICE-SL:W1A-006#91:1>,"First, older males who commit incest against family members make maximum effort to maintain secrecy about this behaviour in view of shame associated with the act, possible consequences from other family members, possible legal consequences and being ostracized by the community. <X>Approaching children when they are still very young especially girls, committing sexual acts when the child is at sleep and intimidation of the victim are different means used by the perpetrators to maintain the secrecy of the act (Silva, et al. 2002).</p>
 
 <p>Second, the incestuous males often perform their sex acts under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol may be used as a means of overcoming any inhibitions relating to such sex acts (Silva, et al 2002).</p>
 
 <p>Third, the passive partner in incest cases is typically a girl child who is much younger than the active male partner (Silva, et al. 2002).</p>
 
 <p>Fourth, the passive partner is often initiated into sex via incest (Silva, et al. 2002).</p>
 
 <p>With regard to incestuous behaviours, two types of sex acts have commonly been reported. One type of behaviour involves sexual play, while the other form is penetrative vaginal sex. While the former mainly involves girl children who have not attained puberty and the incestuous male does not want to cause 'serious' damage to the victim who is obviously an immediate family member, the latter type appears to be more common where the kinship relation is more distant and where the child is older and perhaps at least partially responsive to the act. However, there is no clear-cut distinction between these two types of acts and the former can easily progress to the latter once the opportunity permits it (Silva, et al., 2002).</p>
 
 <h>Impact on Children</h>
 
 <p>Children who have been sexually abused through an incestuous relationship often suffer even after the abuse has ended. Some of the damage caused is obvious while some are not. Children may suffer from psychological impacts such as: guilt, shame, grief, anger,  helplessness and depression. While, condemnation and being ostracized by other family members, disruption of schooling, loss of virginity, illegitimate teenage pregnancy, adverse health conditions, drug and alcohol abuse, fear of intimacy, suicidal thoughts, long-term mental illness and institutionalization are the physical impacts and changes that the child incest victim has to face (Silva, et al.;2002,-Pandey, 2005).
  When considering psychological impacts, children may feel guilty as they tend to believe that they are responsible for the act in some way or the</p>
 
 <p>other. The guilty secret may also make them feel worthless which results in shame. Fear, is a fact that keeps them from reporting the abuse to another adult. They may also stop seeing the world as a safe and friendly place as the abuse is done by a trusted adult. Intense and uncontrollable anger could also be felt and these result in the child showing anger to the wrong people-most often the mother. They may even hurt themselves or a pet. Depression could make the child sad, withdrawn and less playful resulting in the lack of interest in school and other activities (Pandey, 2005).</p>
 
 <p>Physical impacts and changes are other facts that merit consideration. Condemnation of the child may take place when he or she reports the case to another adult. The child is ignored and the event is covered up in view of stigma, increased tension and possible breakup of the family following public knowledge of the situation. This could result in the child dropping out of school due to the inability to face society. An unclean feeling could also be felt by the child due to the loss of virginity. Illegitimate teenage pregnancy could also contribute to dropping out of school and serious physical damage to the girl child as her body may not be ready for such functions. The child may also get subject to sexually transmitted diseases which results in adverse health issues. Drug and alcohol abuse is another side effect of childhood incest. This too adds to the sad reality of these innocent children. Victims of incest tend to show a fear of intimacy even in a marital relationship as they grow up, as most sexually abused victims do. This greatly affects the <w>victim's</w> marital life and could result in the break up of the married couple. Hence, once again the victim may lead a sad and lonely life. This fact and many others could also result in creating suicidal thoughts in the mind of the victim. All of the above factors together could contribute to long-term mental illness of the child which most often than not continues to adulthood and as a result the victim is</p>
 
 <p>institutionalized until recovery or sometimes even till death (Pandey, 2005,'Peters, 1989).</p>
 
 <h>How Can the Society Help?</h>
 
 <p>Taking into consideration all of the above facts, one wonders if children in the Sri Lankan society could be kept safe from such abusive relationships. As a society we should lobby against incest and raise awareness of the issue among the decision-makers and the public, including potential victims. While the legal framework is currently available in Sri Lanka, enforcement appears to be weak due to various factors as discussed above. Often incest is not taken seriously by the relevant law enforcement agencies.</p>
 
 <p>There are many changes that should be done in hospitals, police stations, probation services and other institutions dealing with these cases. Child health care centres and hospitals should provide counseling to the affected child, referring all child victims of incest to law enforcement agencies and giving appropriate training to all staff members in dealing with victims of sexual violence and to deal with effected children sensitively and efficiently. Another important step that should be taken is to increase the number of <w>Children's</w> Desks in police stations, raise awareness among the police staff about the legal provisions against incest. Probation officers need to be trained to effectively address the needs of victims of sexual violence (Silva, et al. 2002).</p>
 
 <p>As the school plays an important role in a <w>child's</w> life there are many changes that need to take place in these institutions as well. School counseling services for children need to be expanded while children should be made aware of dangers of the society. In the case of incest, they should be taught how to avoid possible abuse by trusted adults as children are always taught not to trust strangers. Staff members should try to avoid</p>
 
 <p>any kind of prejudice towards victims and they too need to be educated about legal provisions against incest as most children who are incest victims report abuse in their homes to their teachers at school (Silva, et al. 2002). Teachers need to be made aware of behavioural changes that may give them a hint of a child facing abuse at home.</p>
 
 <p>Non Governmental Organizations play an important role in helping victims of incest. They, too can help to improve the current incest situation in Sri Lanka by increasing the number of crisis centres, allocating more resources for Non Governmental Organizations involved in child protection services and advocacy and improving quality of services provided in child care centres and crisis centres for women (Silva, et al.; 2002).</p>
 
 <p>It is heartening to know that a police hotline for sexually abused victims has been in place during the past few years and it shows that steps have been taken in order to create awareness. However, it needs to be brought out to the public in a more effective manner by using different communicative media such as television, radio or even by the use of posters in public areas.</p>
 
 <p>In spite of all the above suggestions eliminating incest is not easy, as putting all of the above suggestions into practice will definitely take a long period of time and a lot of effort and dedication. In addition to the above problems the following fact plays an even more major role in barring this battle against incest as the perpetrator is almost always an adult that the parents or parent trusts and one the child feels comfortable or secure with. Even though the task of preventing such situations seems daunting, the immediate necessity, as mentioned above, is to raise more awareness, to address reality that such an evil does exist, and work together as a community to prevent it and to recognize children who are often 'not heard' and to speak out in defense of them, so as to make sure that these</p>
 
 <p>children who are the future of our nation grow up in a safe and secure environment.</p>

 <h>Role of the government</h>
 <p>Sri Lankan Government has taken many measures to help promote the ayurvedic practices. The government has invested on raising the awareness of the people to understand the medicinal values of plants and herbs. The ideology is to promote the use of these as curative and preventive measures.</p>
 
 
 <p>One should not forget that people sought to home medications, without the consultation of an ayurvedic practitioner or proper knowledge of the ingredients and their effect on our body. While some medicinal herbs can be good for some ailments, they can be completely useless to treat other. Although herbs and plants usually do not harm our bodies, the problem may still remain unsolved. Besides, the problems are usually only symptoms of much larger illnesses, which ordinary people do not understand. This awareness will also promote healthy living and eating practices. The government has introduced porridge made of green leaves, known in Sinhala as ""kolakande"" in schools, in the attempt to make their point heard. They have also introduced the yoga in some institutions to relieve mental stress. It is praiseworthy thus that the government is making an attempt to raise the awareness of ayurvedic practices among common people.</p>
 
 <p>The government of Sri Lanka is also reaching out to render the service of these practitioners to the sick who want to obtain it. The government through the municipal councils has built and overlooks the healthy running of many ayurvedic hospitals around the island. In addition there are two major hospitals, one in Colombo and the other in Jaffna, which come under the direct purview of the central government. These hospitals also double up as teaching hospitals, endeavoring to pass on the deep understandings of life to students who wish to practice forth these principles with precision. Island-wide in addition to the government hospitals, there are many private hospitals and clinics that serve the people. Siddhalepa Hospital could be a famous example for the private ayurvedic hospitals. There are cumulatively approximately</p>
 
 <p>17500 ayurvedic practitioners practicing island-wide, both in the private and public sector.</p>
 
 <p>The commitment of the Sri Lankan government to develop the sector is further enhanced by the impending introduction of an ayurvedic medical faculty to the Eastern University. Additionally there is also a postgraduate institute in Colombo to aid in the transfer of knowledge. The government has also invested in two research institutes in Nawinna and Kelaniya to aid the growth and development of the science. Further more, in order to ensure island-wide distribution of ayurvedic medicines at affordable rates, the government has instituted the Ayurvedic Drug Co-operation, through which all ayurvedic medicine distribution is channeled.</p>
 
 
 <h>Shortcomings</h>
 <p>Having praised the government of Sri Lanka for its efforts, as with all other government services, efficiency and effectiveness remain an issue even in ayurvedic and healthcare at large. Although the government has put much effort in ensuring that the awareness of ayurvedic practices has been created, the allocations to cater for the growing number of patients seeking the service</p>
 
 
 <p>have not been created. Practitioners are of the view that they are unable to treat and accommodate all the patients. They complain that many have to be turned away because of the lack of resources. The research institutes lack sufficient laboratory facilities and sophisticated equipments required for the development. The equipments are outdated both in the research institutes and in the hospitals. Urban dwellers have many private practitioners and organizations to develop the healthcare sector, but the people of the rural area are dependent on the government and the NGOs. It is time for the government to take stock and make resources available to the development of the existing ayurvedic facilities.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <h>1.4 Western <w>Medicines'</w> advantages over ayurvedic medicines</h>
 <p>Having talked about the many advantages of the ayurvedic medicines, it is unfair not to say a few words about the advantages of the western medicines. In contrast to ayurvedic medicines western medicines take far less time to take effect. In fact the effect is almost instantaneous; as soon as one takes the medication he/she feels the relief. In unbearable illnesses it is draining to suffer from pain till the ayurvedic medicines takes its effect. Further more western medicines require no dietary control (in general). Although recently managed dietary and physical exercises are recommended, they are not part of the medication and do not affect the effects of the medications.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The biggest advantage of the western system of treatment is that surgeries and the treatments based on latest technologies. Surgeries are not carried out by ayurvedic practitioners currently, although they were a significant part of historic ayurvedic practices. When ailments require such big treatments, the people have no alternative but to obtain the service of the western medical practitioner.</p>

 <h>1.5 Conclusion</h>
 
 <p>Ayurveda is the knowledge and science of life that has been passed down the generations. Although many feared that the great principles may have been lost forever, it has recently been reincarnated, owing to the efforts by the government. For many generations it has been the source of <}><->healthcare</-><+>health care</+></}> for many village people, due to the inaccessibility and the high cost acquiring western medications. The government has pledged to create awareness of ayurvedic medications and the medicinal values of herbs and plants. Many increasingly prefer to use this stream of <}><->healthcare</-><+>health care</+></}> as they believe it is safer than western medications. Although it is proven that many diseases can be completely cured effectively by ayurvedic treatment, other illnesses which require surgeries and modern treatments may have to be treated according to the western practices. However these remain only a handful in comparison to the amount of people who daily seek treatment for many illnesses for which western medicines cannot give complete cure, nor eradicate the recurrence of the diseases.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>In my view the ayurvedic care provides a significant part of the healthcare in Sri Lanka. However, with the increasing population and the increasing number of pre-western medicine users turning to ayurvedic treatments, there are not enough resources to go around. Although government has made an effort, which should be praised, the effort has not been sustained to cater to the growing needs of the population seeking ayurvedic treatments. In my opinion, there is much to be done to attend to the cries of the sick calling for help<+>.</+></p>

 <h>Interview with Dr. <@>Dinesh Balachandran</@></h>
 
 <h>Ql) How does Ayurvedic healing system help humanity?</h>
 
 <p>As a private medical practitioner aspects taken into consideration are</p> 
 <p>i.	Preparation</p> 
 <p>ii.     	Costs</p>
 <p>iii.     	Availability of herbs and ingredients and iv.     <w>People's</w> acceptance.</p>
 
 <p>Most of the herbs used in this system can be found locally, for the patients themselves to prepare the medicines under the guidance of a physician. Costs are affordable to the patients.</p>
 
 <p>Many preventive methods are introduced in this medical system, e.g. Use of margosa tender leaves and sacred basil leaves help prevent and control infectious diseases. Purgatives, oil baths and massages help in prevention of the diseases too. While oil baths and massaging help in cooling the body purgatives help in disposing the unwanted elements in the body as well as act as a purifying agent. Some herbs help preserve the skin texture, e.g. Turmeric Aloe-vera. Yoga and meditation help in mental wellbeing and help in relieving of mental strain.</p>
 
 <p>So ayurveda helps one in leading a healthy life, gives the body physical immunity and also gives emotional resistance to sickness.</p>
 
 <h>Q2) What are the other benefits of this medicine?</h>
 
 <p>When we take the curative aspect of this medical system there are many benefits. Some diseases which are not curable by other medical systems are</p>
 
 <p>curable by ayurveda, such as some skin diseases, asthma. Some of the uterine conditions could be treated effectively by this system.</p>
 
 <p>Ayurvedic system uses ""pulse reading"" for diagnosis, aiding the physician to treat the disease effectively. Ayurveda only uses medicines from natural sources. No artificial products are used. So these drugs do no harm to the body and its natural balance, and gives rise to no side effects.</p>
 
 <h>Q3) Does diet go hand in hand with the treatment of diseases?</h>
 
 <p>Yes. Underlining rule is avoiding all that have damaging influence on body and soul, including addictions such as use of liquor. Ayurveda operates on the precept that various vegetables and fruits have medicinal values. E.g. Lime used in treating vomiting and anorexia, garlic has the ability to control cholesterol.</p>
 
 <p>Ayurvedic treatment not only requires diet change but also lifestyle and habitual changes. Patient will have to resort to some sort of activity such as meditation, yoga and/or exercise to gain peace and fulfillment of mind.</p>
 
 <h>Q4) Is it true that ayurvedic healing system heals the disease completely?</h>
 
 <p>In ayurvedic system the root of the cause of the disease is detected and healed. If the root cause is destroyed there is what most refer as complete cure of the disease, unlike in other medical systems where the symptoms are subdued more often than otherwise. With healthy lifestyle and meditation one could prevent disease from recurring.</p>

 <h>AYURVEDIC CARE IN SRI LANKAN HEALTHCARE</h>
 
 <h>Interview with Dr. <@>M. Krishna Moorthy</@></h>
 
 <h>Q1: Can you explain briefly the Ayurvedic care in Sri Lanka?</h>
 <p>In Sri Lanka Ayurveda has been practiced from ancient time. It plays a great role in Sri Lankan health care as it adopts many preventive methods as well as curative methods. The people from remote rural areas use this medical system more often. Recently we note that the people of urban areas too have reverted back to this healing system .There are many dispensaries set up to provide services to the people who use this healing system, Most of which are under provincial councils. There are two major ayurvedic hospitals which come under the purview of the centra) government. They also serve as teaching hospitals.</p>
 <p>i. Borella Ayurvedic Hospital, Colombo</p> 
 <p>ii. Kaithady sidha hospital, Jaffna</p>
 <p>These hospitals have O.P.D. facilities as well as inward facilities. Every day more than 500 out-patients receive treatment in these hospitals. These hospitals have a capacity of 150 beds as to treat in-patients, should patients be require to be hospitalised for treatment. There are other private ayurvedic hospitals, one of which is the Siddhalepa Hospital. Many people get treated here daily. Island-wide approximately 17500 ayurvedic practitioners are serving the people in both private and public hospitals and clinics. Distribution of ayurvedic medicines are channeled through the Ayurvedic Drug Co-operation.</p>
 <p>Although only the two government hospitals, i.e. in Kaithady, Jaffna and Borella, Colombo, perform the role of universities currently, an ayurvedic medical faculty is to be introduced to the Eastern University in the near future.</p>
 
 
 <p>There is also a postgraduate institute located in Colombo. There are research institutes located in Nawinna, Bandaranayake Ayurveda Research Institute and in Kelaniya, Gampaha Wickramarachchi Sidha Ayurvedic Institute, which aid the ayurvedic medical system to grow and provide the people of Sri Lanka more effective services.</p>
 
 <p>I could say ayurveda plays an important role in the heath care of Sri Lanka.</p>
 
 <h>Q2) Ayurvedic system of healing is hailed for its prevention of diseases. Is there any steps taken to make people aware of this concept of ayurvedic medicine?</h>
 <p>Yes. In rural areas where herbs are freely available herbal gardens are introduced by the government, and people are made aware of the medicinal values of these herbs. Under that concept some schools have introduced with 'kolekande<+>'</+> which is a porridge made with green leaves and Yoga is introduced in some institutions to ease the stress of mind. Other famous method is oil application. It is very popular among rural folk. In the customs of New Year celebration we note the great importance given to this practice. Oil baths and fermentation are other preventive methods, which help people physically and mentally and are very effective. It is no wonder that it is popular among tourists and they visit our shores to tap on this rare asset of oil baths and massage centers available island-wide. The good news is that message is enhanced by advertising carried out by the commercial institutions.</p>

 <h>AYURVEDIC CARE IN SRI LANKAN HEALTHCARE</h>
 
 <h>Q3) How could this great medical system and its services be improved in Sri Lanka?</h>
 
 <p>Recently there have been tremendous developments in this field. People have begun to value this system of healing. But in my opinion it is not sufficient. More research could be done to improve this medical system. More Laboratory facilities are needed in hospitals and research institutes. Hospitals could be upgraded, that more patients will have the facilities to be treated in the ayurvedic hospitals.</p>

 <h><w>People's</w> view</h>
 
 <p>The results of the survey revealed some interesting facts. Although the survey was taken in Colombo the identification of the origin made a startling impact on whether they believed in ayurvedic medications or not, even though the use of such preparations for cosmetic purposes<+>.</+></p>
 <p>The results of survey revealed that all rural folks not only believed in the healing powers of ayurvedic medicines, they also used them for most ailments. They agreed that herbs and medicinal plants are a big part of home medicines for common cold, fever etc. However, subsequent discussion with the city dwelling rural origin participants revealed that although they used it more often than otherwise, they seek western medicines when it comes to more serious diseases.</p>s
 <p>Urban origin participants however were less positive about ayurvedic medications. Although 78% of the urban origin participants had faith in ayurvedic medications, only 22% of them had actually sought to ayurvedic medicines for cure. Subsequent discussion revealed that some of those who had claimed that they <w>don't</w> use ayurvedic medicines have actually used them but for reasons under said prefer other medicines more than the ayurvedic medicines.</p>
 <p>The survey revealed that people believe in ayurvedic medicines because they believe these medications give complete cure of their ailments - not just relief. Most of them have experienced it first hand and have no doubt about their beliefs. Others have heard testimonials or have seen a relative or friend healed. Some admit that they had sought ayurvedic treatment as a last recourse, when all other medications had failed. They are reassured by the fact that these medicines do not give rise to side effects. Even those who do not believe in</p>
 
 
 <p>ayurvedic medicines agree to this fact. They say only ayurvedic medication has the answer for many hereditary diseases. Other ailments for which ayurvedic treatment is sought after include rheumatic disorders, migraine, arthritis, skin disorders, etc.</p>
 
 <p>Some said they use it for preventive purposes while most said for curative purposes and some for both. However when asked if they did use some of the medicinal herbs, and medicinal products, they agreed to the usage of them They had not realized the medicinal value in adding some medicinal items into our cooking and some procures we follow. Those who used home medications said they used katpooravalli, corriander, ginger lime, garlic, dill seed, pepper etc. to cure common problems such as headache, stomachache, cold, cough, body pain, gastric disorders, phlegm etc.</p>
 
 <p>Almost all participants said that they prefer western medical care for major sicknesses like heart attack, cancer, AIDS, appendix, brain tumor, etc. They also agree that they prefer western medication for quick relief.</p>
 
 <p>Most use ayurvedic products for cosmetic purposes. Although almost none use direct preparation by ayurvedic practitioners, some did agree to using herbs such as turmeric and aloe vera as home remedies Yet others said they would shop for off-the-shelf cosmetic product with ayurvedic or herbal preparation, as they are safer to use and do not give rise to any side effects.</p>
 
 <p>One of the complaint that the participants highlighted as the main reason for not preferring to seek ayurvedic treatment is that the duration is long, sometimes months at length, and they require tremendous amount of self effort, from restricted diets to physical exercise and lifestyle changes. Furthermore they complain that the medications often have an unpleasant taste and/or smell.</p>
 
 <p>We were unable to gather sufficient evidence to say that ayurvedic care plays a major role in the healthcare of Sri Lanka. Our control study proved that the sample taken in Colombo would be bias, as most urban dwellers were of the opinion that it plays almost an insignificant role in the healthcare service as a whole. However the literature review demonstrates otherwise.</p>
 
 <p>Yet the survey did it part in evidencing that ayurveda plays a great role in the prevention and management of illnesses in Sri Lanka although, the opinion of its role in the treatment of diseases seem to vary.</p>

SriLankanEnglish,may,The child may also get subject to sexually transmitted diseases which results in adverse health issues,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,<ICE-SL:W1A-006#91:1>,"First, older males who commit incest against family members make maximum effort to maintain secrecy about this behaviour in view of shame associated with the act, possible consequences from other family members, possible legal consequences and being ostracized by the community. <X>Approaching children when they are still very young especially girls, committing sexual acts when the child is at sleep and intimidation of the victim are different means used by the perpetrators to maintain the secrecy of the act (Silva, et al. 2002).</p>
 
 <p>Second, the incestuous males often perform their sex acts under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol may be used as a means of overcoming any inhibitions relating to such sex acts (Silva, et al 2002).</p>
 
 <p>Third, the passive partner in incest cases is typically a girl child who is much younger than the active male partner (Silva, et al. 2002).</p>
 
 <p>Fourth, the passive partner is often initiated into sex via incest (Silva, et al. 2002).</p>
 
 <p>With regard to incestuous behaviours, two types of sex acts have commonly been reported. One type of behaviour involves sexual play, while the other form is penetrative vaginal sex. While the former mainly involves girl children who have not attained puberty and the incestuous male does not want to cause 'serious' damage to the victim who is obviously an immediate family member, the latter type appears to be more common where the kinship relation is more distant and where the child is older and perhaps at least partially responsive to the act. However, there is no clear-cut distinction between these two types of acts and the former can easily progress to the latter once the opportunity permits it (Silva, et al., 2002).</p>
 
 <h>Impact on Children</h>
 
 <p>Children who have been sexually abused through an incestuous relationship often suffer even after the abuse has ended. Some of the damage caused is obvious while some are not. Children may suffer from psychological impacts such as: guilt, shame, grief, anger,  helplessness and depression. While, condemnation and being ostracized by other family members, disruption of schooling, loss of virginity, illegitimate teenage pregnancy, adverse health conditions, drug and alcohol abuse, fear of intimacy, suicidal thoughts, long-term mental illness and institutionalization are the physical impacts and changes that the child incest victim has to face (Silva, et al.;2002,-Pandey, 2005).
  When considering psychological impacts, children may feel guilty as they tend to believe that they are responsible for the act in some way or the</p>
 
 <p>other. The guilty secret may also make them feel worthless which results in shame. Fear, is a fact that keeps them from reporting the abuse to another adult. They may also stop seeing the world as a safe and friendly place as the abuse is done by a trusted adult. Intense and uncontrollable anger could also be felt and these result in the child showing anger to the wrong people-most often the mother. They may even hurt themselves or a pet. Depression could make the child sad, withdrawn and less playful resulting in the lack of interest in school and other activities (Pandey, 2005).</p>
 
 <p>Physical impacts and changes are other facts that merit consideration. Condemnation of the child may take place when he or she reports the case to another adult. The child is ignored and the event is covered up in view of stigma, increased tension and possible breakup of the family following public knowledge of the situation. This could result in the child dropping out of school due to the inability to face society. An unclean feeling could also be felt by the child due to the loss of virginity. Illegitimate teenage pregnancy could also contribute to dropping out of school and serious physical damage to the girl child as her body may not be ready for such functions. The child may also get subject to sexually transmitted diseases which results in adverse health issues. Drug and alcohol abuse is another side effect of childhood incest. This too adds to the sad reality of these innocent children. Victims of incest tend to show a fear of intimacy even in a marital relationship as they grow up, as most sexually abused victims do. This greatly affects the <w>victim's</w> marital life and could result in the break up of the married couple. Hence, once again the victim may lead a sad and lonely life. This fact and many others could also result in creating suicidal thoughts in the mind of the victim. All of the above factors together could contribute to long-term mental illness of the child which most often than not continues to adulthood and as a result the victim is</p>
 
 <p>institutionalized until recovery or sometimes even till death (Pandey, 2005,'Peters, 1989).</p>
 
 <h>How Can the Society Help?</h>
 
 <p>Taking into consideration all of the above facts, one wonders if children in the Sri Lankan society could be kept safe from such abusive relationships. As a society we should lobby against incest and raise awareness of the issue among the decision-makers and the public, including potential victims. While the legal framework is currently available in Sri Lanka, enforcement appears to be weak due to various factors as discussed above. Often incest is not taken seriously by the relevant law enforcement agencies.</p>
 
 <p>There are many changes that should be done in hospitals, police stations, probation services and other institutions dealing with these cases. Child health care centres and hospitals should provide counseling to the affected child, referring all child victims of incest to law enforcement agencies and giving appropriate training to all staff members in dealing with victims of sexual violence and to deal with effected children sensitively and efficiently. Another important step that should be taken is to increase the number of <w>Children's</w> Desks in police stations, raise awareness among the police staff about the legal provisions against incest. Probation officers need to be trained to effectively address the needs of victims of sexual violence (Silva, et al. 2002).</p>
 
 <p>As the school plays an important role in a <w>child's</w> life there are many changes that need to take place in these institutions as well. School counseling services for children need to be expanded while children should be made aware of dangers of the society. In the case of incest, they should be taught how to avoid possible abuse by trusted adults as children are always taught not to trust strangers. Staff members should try to avoid</p>
 
 <p>any kind of prejudice towards victims and they too need to be educated about legal provisions against incest as most children who are incest victims report abuse in their homes to their teachers at school (Silva, et al. 2002). Teachers need to be made aware of behavioural changes that may give them a hint of a child facing abuse at home.</p>
 
 <p>Non Governmental Organizations play an important role in helping victims of incest. They, too can help to improve the current incest situation in Sri Lanka by increasing the number of crisis centres, allocating more resources for Non Governmental Organizations involved in child protection services and advocacy and improving quality of services provided in child care centres and crisis centres for women (Silva, et al.; 2002).</p>
 
 <p>It is heartening to know that a police hotline for sexually abused victims has been in place during the past few years and it shows that steps have been taken in order to create awareness. However, it needs to be brought out to the public in a more effective manner by using different communicative media such as television, radio or even by the use of posters in public areas.</p>
 
 <p>In spite of all the above suggestions eliminating incest is not easy, as putting all of the above suggestions into practice will definitely take a long period of time and a lot of effort and dedication. In addition to the above problems the following fact plays an even more major role in barring this battle against incest as the perpetrator is almost always an adult that the parents or parent trusts and one the child feels comfortable or secure with.

This happens because the normal height upper floors are much stiffer and hence tend to behave as one block. Another source of irregularity is the introduction of large set backs in buildings. These introduce sudden changes in mass while may lead to unpredictable force distribution close to the set back in an earthquake event.
 
 Failure mechanisms of beams and columns: The modem trend in buildings is to maximise the spans while minimising the number of columns. This would necessitate beams of considerable depth where the column sizes are kept relatively small. In an event of an earthquake, the strong beam remain elastic while the weak columns suffer concrete crushing or shear failure. This may lead to the collapse of the building resulting in loss of life. In Sri Lanka, this aspect is not paid much attention by architects and structural design engineers. Therefore, small columns supporting large beams is a common sight in many existing buildings. 
 
 
 STRUCTURAL FORMS FOR BLAST AND EARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE 
 
 The desirable structural forms for blast and earthquake resistance are discussed with respect to the shape of the structure, symmetricity, distribution of strength and failure mechanisms of beams and columns. 
 
 Effects of shape: It is desirable to use plan shape' without re-entrant corners with respect to blast resistance since such corners can amplify the blast effects. Large re-entrant corners are not desirable with respect to earthquake resistance as well since they can make the structure irregular in shape. The geometric irregularities that can be acceptable on plan for regular structures are given in AS 1170/4 : 1993. When these limits are violated, the structure may need a dynamic analysis to determine distribution of earthquake forces. However, such an analysis is not a guarantee that the structure will have a desirable behaviour when geometric irregularities are substantial. Thus, when re-entrant corners are essential, those should be kept within the limits and the façade in such areas should be made resistant to blast loads by using an appropriate strong material such as concrete. The number of openings in such areas also should be minimised.
 
 Effects of symmetry: Irregular buildings, such as those with lateral load resisting strong elements arranged unsymmetrically, will be subjected to excessive torsional moments in large blasts and earthquakes. Therefore, even for buildings with irregular shapes in plan, every attempt should be made to ensure that the shear centre of strong elements of the building coincides with the line of action of forces. 
 
 Effects of distribution of strength: The use of double height lobby areas introduce soft stories in buildings. In such instances, it is advisable to introduce columns of cross sections larger than usually required. Such large columns would help to reduce the deflections and also the difference in stiffness. As a result, the rotational deformations of columns also will be reduced. Such columns can also be carefully detailed to provide them with sufficient ductility. thus avoiding brittle failure of columns. The use of earthquake resistant reinforcement details in these columns can enhance the confinement to concrete thus the rotational capacity of columns also will be improved. This measure will be of help with respect to blasts as well since large reinforced concrete columns would be able to resist blast effects much better due to their massive size and reserve strength. 
 
 Another source that introduces uneven distribution of strength is set-backs. With respect to blast resistance, it is desirable to have large set-backs in order to improve the stand-off for part of the building. However, this is not desirable with respect to earthquake resistance. Therefore, a compromise solution will be required for setbacks. It is recommended in AS 1170/4:1993 to have setbacks. When such recommendations are violated, it will be necessary to carryout dynamic analysis to determine the force distributions that may arise in earthquakes. However, such an analysis may not be a guarantee of satisfactory behaviour in an earthquake. Therefore, it is desirable to comply with the guidelines. When this is not possible due to functional requirements, it would be desirable to construct the projecting part of the building at ground floor level as a separate building. 
 
 Failure mechanisms of beams and columns: It may be advisable to avoid large span beams whenever possible with respect to earthquake resistance. Therefore, it is desirable to use smaller spans supported on large number of columns. In earthquakes, the use of detailing that improves the ductility will enhance the chances of survival of such beam column monolithic systems. In blasts also, the chances of the structure collapsing due to one or two columns being destroyed would be reduced since the upper part of the structure may now be able to behave as a very deep lattice girder. However, such a behaviour would not be possible when the number of columns are minimised by maximising the spans. 
 
 It can from above that the structural form can be selected in such a way so that the resistance to blast and earthquake effects can be enhanced. Therefore, for future public buildings constructed in Sri Lanka, these features should be carefully incorporated at least to some degree. 
 
 
 STRUCTURAL DETAILING FOR BLAST AND EARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE 
 
 The use of good structural forms alone is not sufficient in minimising the casualties in blasts earthquakes. Even monolithic structures with good structural forms can collapse due to lack of ductility. The structural detailing recommended in BS 8110 is adequate for static loading arising out of dead and live loads. However, when the structure is subjected to dynamic loading of high magnitudes, ductility offered by such detailing would be inadequate to prevent excessive damage. 
 
 Earthquake Resistant reinforcement Details
 
 It is impossible to resist earthquake loads on structures by relying either on the over-strength in the structure or the ductility of the structure. Relying on over-strength means designing of structures for larger load intensities than usual so that the resulting structure will be stronger than required under normal circumstances. Relying on ductility means enhancing the ductility of the members and the joints so that the structure is capable to undergoing large inelastic deformations without collapse when subjected to overloads (Mendis & Goldsworthy, 1995). The main drawback of designing for over-strength is that it does not eliminate the risk of the structure collapsing when the design loads are exceeded. However, designing for improved ductility may be able to prevent the total collapse of the structure even in an extreme event. According to AS 117014: 1993, it is possible to improve the ductility of structures by adopting the details recommended for intermediate moment resisting frames (IMRFs). The details adopted are quit similar to those recommended as earthquake resistant details by Dowrick ( 1977), Pinto (1987) etc. 
 
 When subjected to earthquakes, the points of contraflexure in columns change and columns can even be subjected to single curvature, thus leading to increases in bending moments  (Park & Paulay, 1975). Such changes occur due to the influences of higher mode of vibration, particularly second and third modes. Thus, in columns, plastic hinges and occur at the beam column junctions, and may cause destruction of columns due to crushing of concrete when the confinement is insufficient. According to Woodside (1995) that most of the buildings failures in Japans Kobe 1995 earthquake have occurred due to poor detailing of columns in buildings. In this earthquake, nearly 82,000 buildings had collapsed and a similar number suffered partial collapse. In order to avoid such failures, links in columns and location of splice bars will need special care. 
 
 The reinforcement details recommended for columns in Dowrick (1977) is given in Details Sheet No 1. It can be seen that the column reinforcement splices are locate away from beam column junctions since plastic hinges occur at these locations. The amount of links are also increased close to the beam column junctions. These details differ from the Standard Method of Detailing adopted in Sri Lanka where the link spacing is generally maintained at about 12 times the smallest vertical reinforcement bar diameter. The columns splices are also located just above the beam column junctions. Thus, it can be seen that the usual detailing practice adopted in Sri Lanka is quite inadequate for columns. Therefore, the chances of columns failing are quite high, which can lead to total collapse of buildings. As reported by Saaticioglu & Bruneau (1993), Mitchell & Tinawi (1992), in Erzincan 1992 and Costa-Rican 1991 earthquakes also many buildings with poor column details were completely destroyed. In many other buildings, damage was disproportionate to the magnitude of the earthquake that had occurred. 
 
 In an earthquake, there is an acceleration in the vertical direction in addition to those in lateral directions. These vertical accelerations can induce moment reversals in beams. The change of point of contraflexure in columns can also contribute to this. Thus, beams will need some reverse moment capacity, which means the sections subjected to primarily sagging will need a certain amount of hogging moment capacity and vice versa. 
 
 According to recommendations given in AS 3600 (1994), the area of bottom reinforcement provided at support face should be able to resist one third of the design hogging moment when acting in reverse direction. This will help the beam to resist moment reversals resulting due to earthquake loads. It will also ensure proper anchorage of bottom reinforcement specially at external columns. It is necessary to ensure that at an section, the beam can resist either a sagging or a hogging moment of one fifth the magnitude of the maximum hogging moment provided at either support. These details are indicated in Detail Sheet No: 2. These recommendations are a deviation from the normal practice adopted in Sri Lanka, and it may result in some increase in top longitudinal reinforcement at span sections. 
 
 In an earthquake, the beam column junctions also will be subjected to extra shear forces and tensile stresses that may not exist with static behaviour, which can lead to cracking. Therefore, beam column junctions also will need extra links to prevent failure of concrete (Mendis and Goldsworthy, 1995). These additional link can prevent cracks that can lead to deterioration of bond between reinforcement and concrete, thus causing significant strength and stiffness degradation. Once a joint fails, the capacity to transfer seismic and gravity loads can be lost, possibly resulting in partial or complete collapse of the structure. The extra links required are shown in Detail Sheet No: I. This is an important deviation from the detailing recommended in Standard Method of Detailing as practiced in Sri Lanka. In the general details adopted, no links are provided within the depth of the beam at beam column junctions. 
 
 I can be seen that the adoption of earthquake resistant detailing in moment resisting frames is not a difficult task. The extra reinforcement required will mainly be necessary to prevent crushing failure of concrete by providing additional shear links. The extra main reinforcement requirement will be limited only to lightly loaded beams where small diameter hanger bars would need replacement with larger bars. 
 
 Blast resistant Reinforcement Details
 
 When reinforced concrete elements are dynamically loaded due to blasts, the elements deflect until such time as the strain energy of the element is developed sufficiently to balance the energy delivered by the blast load. If this energy cannot be developed without fracture, then fragmentation of concrete will occur. Therefore, special details are required, which will ensure load carrying capacity of the member, even when fragmentation of concrete does occur. This can be achieved by providing compression reinforcement that is equal to the tension reinforcement provided. In the presence of adequate links, such beams will be able to carry significantly high loads (Institution of Structural Engineers, 1995). This detail is required only for the ground and first floor beams where the blast effects can be quite severe. This means that the blast resistant construction of beams will need a further increase in reinforcement to resist moment reversals than those specified for earthquake resistance at these levels.
 
 It is recommended that the joint details shown in Figure 4 should b~ used at beam column junctions (The Institution of Structural Engineers, 1995). However, with this detail, the beams reinforcement is anchored in the column where plastic hinges can occur in earthquakes. This recommendation is therefore not desirable with respect to earthquake details. The reason for such recommendation is to ensure that the beam will not separate from the column, when no links are provided within the depth of the beam. However, in earthquake detailing as shown in Detail Sheet No 1, there are links provided for the column reinforcement within the depth of the beam. These links will be able to prevent the separation of the beam and the column even when the beam reinforcement is anchored within the depth of the beam. Therefore, it would be advisable to comply with earthquake resistant details recommended for beam column junctions with respect to both earthquakes and details.
 
 The blast pressure that enter the structure through the shattered windows and the failed curtain walls will load the underside and subsequently the top surfaces of the floor slabs along the height of the building. There will be a brief time for which floors will receive a net upward loading (Ettouney et al., 1996, Mainstone, 1976). This upward load requires that the slab be reinforced to resist loads opposing the effects of gravity. It is recommended that top reinforcement should be provided over the complete area of first floor slabs and ground floors which have been designed as suspended (The Institution of Structural Engineers, 1995). This is a deviation from the earthquake detailing where continuation of top and bottom reinforcement is required only in cantilever slabs. This is a deviation from the normal details adopted in Sri Lanka for slabs as well. 
 
 When concrete columns are subjected to blast loads, there is a possibility for total elimination of a column. In such instances, the upper floor columns and beams can act as a lattice girder when the number of upper floors are large and those are capable of  forming a lattice girder. However, in low rise buildings such as those with less than five floors, it is possible that adequate ties are not provided and hence may not be able to form such lattice girders. It should be noted that ties are specified for building having five or more storeys in BS 8110 (1985). It is suggested by Elliot et a1. (1992) that even a building with less than five floors should be designed such that removal of one element will cause only local collapse. Therefore, the provision of ties should be adopted for two storey and above for reinforced concrete buildings that will be constructed in Sri Lanka in future. 
 
 These indicates that adoption of the earthquake resistant detailing in reinforced concrete structures will be able to improve the structure to comply with most of the blast resistant requirements. The extra details are required only in beams and slabs located above the ground and first floor levels.</X></p></I>

 <p>The way in which we interact with the community at large, demonstrating loving kindness must be inculcated in the adolescents. Underpinning this is the concept that the world's main religions agree upon: treat other people as you would like to be treated. By involving teenagers in acts of helping others, schools and parents build in them a sense of compassion and the ability to contribute to a better world. Related to this is the ability to be kind to oneself. In the times of hardship and unhappiness that adolescents almost inevitably face at some stage, it is critical to know how to be kind to themselves. Parents can help their teenagers understand that life is rarely, if ever, completely happy. Learning to persist on the face of adversity and to be kind to one self, as well as seeking out help if needed, are enormously useful skills. When handling teenagers it is vital to keep in mind that theylack in the power of resilience. Having a range of friends is one of the powerful promoters of resilience. A young person doesn't need to be the most sociable, outgoing person on the block, but having a few social options so that if they fall out with one bunch of friends they can hang out with another, is really helpful. Teenagers must be trained to develop their character as leaders and citizens by taking on roles that create positive change in schools, clubs and communities. Wise schools offer a range of leadership experiences in which all students c'lll participate in some way .. Involvirlg adolescents in experiences in which they are required to demonstrate self-control, prudence and humility develops their brain functioning, especially in the limbic system and the frontal lobes. Children who have leadership qualities tend to be very sensitive and relate to others with immense respect and regard. Such teenagers understand reality from that of fantasy and this enables them to live within the parameters of sanity even at a time of stress and turmoil. Adolescence is a time when two major processes are changing the brain to make it a more sophisticated instrument. Understanding these processes can help facilitate a calmer household and a more productive classroom. The first of these processes is synaptic pruning. Synapses are the connections between brain cells, and we build trillions of them during the first nine years of life. Then the human brain does something really weird - it gets rid of most of them. During adolescence, more than half of the synapses vanish. Most of the synapses that are lost during adolescence are in the frontal lobes, where planning, forethought, impulse control and consideration of long term consequences occur. This explains why, when you ask teenagers what they are thinking, they look dumbfounded and say, 'What?'
 The second main process that changes the brain is myelination. Myelin sheathing ""\I\'I'aps itself around the axons and neurons of the brain. This process occurs throughout our lives, but accelerates in adolescence. Myelin sheathing turbochargers thinking, causing the brain to think up to 100 times faster. The adolescent brain can think extraordinary quickly in some areas ( consider privacy, embarrassment and arguing with parents), and exceptionally slowly in others(household chores and in many cases, homework completion.} What this all adds up to is that the experiences that we give adolescents in homes and in schools are incredibly important because those experiences shape their brains.</X></p></I> <I><h>"

 <X>Tony was faithfully by my side; since that reunion near the entrance to Mrs Jayasingha's land he had kept close to me almost desperately not wanting to lose contact again, even ignoring the bun I bought for him though it looked quite certain to me that he had been starving in the last few days. 
 
 Fiendish barking and howling had erupted every now and then as we moved through foreign territory but had subsided when we kept going, and Tony kept as close to me as possible pressing against my legs to reassure himself that I was there with him. 
 
 Mr Perera had gone to work at Cargills, his son Anton, my friend had gone to school with his two sisters - in fact all the children of the area were at some school somewhere because it was a weekday, and I had not gone to school because I had never gone to school and at that time I was still not going to school - and that's another story - and on that day it suited me fine that none of the kids I knew were at home, because when you have a secret plan you don't want to meet anybody - and Mrs Perera was trying to persuade me to eat something by way of lunch because it was close to midday and I was eager to get away because when you have a secret plan you want to keep moving all the time and Mrs Perera kept asking me what I was going to do with the dog and I kept improvising a story that Father was going to come within the next few days in Uncle Eugene's car to take him away and Mrs Perera looked like she didn't believe one word of what I said and I felt she thought we were never going to take the dog away but I was not going to tell her that I intended walking all the way to Egodawatta with the dog because then she would have certainly stopped me from doing such a darn fool thing. 
 
 It was very near high noon as I clambered up an embankment and reached the High Level Road, panting sweating and already feeling exhausted having walked the first near half-a-mile. I avoided going through the old gateposts on the old road just after the level crossing, but walked along the road past the post office -now the post office was the front room adjoining the verandah of an old house within a large garden, with the window of the room expanded to form a counter - beyond which on the same side the road fell away to a narrow valley and came up on the other side to meet the High Level Road, and I took the little footpath which linked the two roads, old and new, across the narrow. little valley. 
 
 On my left hand I carried the mirror - it seemed much heavier and larger than I thought it to be - on the right hand the provisions -contained in a gunny bag - and since both my hands were full and I didn't want Tony to stray too much away from me or tarry a while sniffing and peeing I had him on a thin coir rope with one end tied to my trouser buckle; those days trousers - short as well as long -had two buckles of white nickel on the sides to hold them tight at the waist. 
 
 The 'Alut Para' was a pretty lonely stretch up to Maharagama in those days and there were no people about when I appeared at a point just before the eleventh-mile post where the road cut through a ridge with the land rising steeply on either side in walls of brick red kapok. 
 
 The road was a shiny path, looking fresh and clean like it has been washed, as it stretched before me and I knew it led straight to where I was going - no branching off, no by-roads, no risk of taking the wrong turn, and I felt comfortable, like someone was holding my hand. 
 
 I walked and I stopped - sometimes to adjust my burdens and some- times to ease the growing pains in my hands and legs - and after a long time of walking and stopping I reached the spot which is known by a large two storeyed store with intricate trellis work in blue and white - Roslin Nonage Kade/Roslin Nona's Boutique, where there was a large mara tree and a gravel road branched off to the left and on the right the same gravel road moved to cross the railway line to meet the old road. Now this would have been a wonderful place to rest awhile - it was cool under the shade of the giant mara tree-but there were people at the boutique and I kept moving on and the road sloped down gently across a paddy field which stretched far away to the left and there was a little temple at the bottom of the road by the edge of the field and on the right of the road the paddy field continued until it reached the rail track, At the end of the slope in the road and before it started climbing again there were mara trees on either side and this is where I stopped. I virtually collapsed. I was still far away from home, and behind me I could still see the road coming out of the cleft in the ridge at the eleventh-mile post. 
 
 As I looked around things were blurred, and there was a feeling some- where in me of getting choked, of not being able to breathe, and my legs were numb and my body wet and slowly going cold, and since this is exactly how I felt when I used to get those fits long ago and which was the reason I was not sent to school - or rather one of the reasons - I was gripped with fear, which made me sweat more and feel dizzy. Then the thought occurred to me - not in a blinding flash, but in a slow gradual manner like when you slip into a coma which happened whenever I had those fits, and which is painless because it means giving up the struggle and relaxing - that I will never make it home. I dropped my head on the gunny bag and felt comfortable and I closed my eyes and heard Tony's heavy breathing and felt his breath on my face, and a breeze came over the paddy fields making me cool like when Mother spread a piece of cloth dipped in cologne on my forehead during high fever. 
 
 There was a time lapse here, a slow mix like in a movie, and then I was moving again -not with any conscious effort, but just moving like a sleep-walker-pushed or pulled by some atavistic fear, because suddenly the thought of night falling had occurred. The heat of the high noon had dropped, the sky had gone grey and the smell of rain hung in the air which moved around silently and stealthily like a cat. The slow climb from under the mara trees was over; the old road joined the new road and the rail track which came along with the old road suddenly pulled away and disappeared among the thick foliage in the large home- gardens behind old houses with sloping roofs and open verandas which once-upon-a-time would have stood far behind their fences but were now almost flush with the new road; a little further up, the old road reappeared, but now it was on the left of the new road and there was only a thin strip of bare land between the two roads and along the old road front were little old houses set inside little plots of land and there was a boutique with a long verandah half enclosed by a counter painted in alternate strips of blue and white on which were bottles with multicoloured lozenges in them; and I kept moving in a daze with hands straining feet paining knees hurting but Tony trotting by my side cool and easy and from somewhere over and beyond the tangle of coconut tree tops and sloping roofs on my right came the sad and melancholy whistle of the little train. 
 
 Then there was the little house by the edge of the road - it stood and still stands, a good forty five years later, just after a point where the old road merges with the new road to re-emerge separately on the other side - the right once more - and just before the new road (then) ran bordering an abandoned rubber plantation with an old upstair house set deep inside. The little house sloped down to rest on four thin wooden columns painted a brick red. There was a teapoy in the middle of the veranda with a tablecloth, white and tasselled at the edges, and on the table was a brass bowl mounted on three brass elephants with raised trunks. There were two chairs with arm rests placed against the wall and on the wall just above the backs of the chairs were two framed rabbits facing each other, and the rabbits were made of satin cloth moulded inside with cotton in bas-relief and outlined with coloured beads and sequins - I couldn't see all these details from the road but knew them by memory because the identical handiwork decorated the main doorway of Geera Atha's house - and Geera Atha was a very old man who brought us milk every morning, and lived all by himself in a very old house which stood at the end of the gravel road a little beyond Mr. Lawrence Perera's homestead. 
 
 The two rabbits on the wall facing each other in the little house by the road pulled me out of the trancelike state in which I was walking; it was something like coming out of a tunnel, or like when you have strayed too far out and you hear something or smell something or see some - thing and you know you're still within reach and not lost. 
 
 I stopped. Right in front of the house. And all of a sudden I felt thirsty. I must have been thirsty all along, but now looking fondly at the two rabbits on the wall wanted a drink of water very badly. 
 
 Putting down the things in my hands was in slow motion, because the hands had gone stiff under the weight and took time to move. The gunny bag stiff and bulging with the provisions stood upright on the ground and the mirror was placed on its face against the bag and Tony released for a moment from my waist first sat on his hind legs and then stretched himself full length from paw to tail-end panting and drooling at the mouth but looking quite pleased with himself, My eyes moved casually over the bag and I had the feeling that something was amiss, but I couldn't quite place my finger on it. I put my hand inside the bag and felt the rice, and the two packs containing sugar and dhal and my hand began to smell of milchard but still I had that uneasy feeling that some- thing was missing and then all at once it struck like a thunderbolt: The Ration Books: The ration books were missing. My knees felt as if they were melting and a hot lump rose up from the guts and pressed against the chest, and it made me dizzy in the head and now I was feeling cold all over like when I used to get those fits. 
 
 (In those days the ration book was an important article in one's existence; it was legal evidence of Ceylonese - Sri Lanka was Ceylon then - citizenship and carried with it the right of universal franchise -and that was crucial when the first UNP government of independent Ceylon headed by Mr D. S. Senanayaka was busy denying segments of Indian labour on the plantations Ceylon citizenship and deporting them to India - it was the national identity card, and if you happened to be poor, like what we had become, was the sole means of your weekly subsistence all rolled into one; without the ration book you were a non-person, and if you lost it the procedure to obtain a new one was very complicated, involving affidavits, long hours at the DRO's office etc., and once a servant -that is when we were at the big house-lost Father's book ,and he was mad having to go through all the trouble of getting a new one and swore that's the last time he will go through the procedure and warned Mother to be careful in future, and Mother was so very careful - especially after we became poor and kept it locked in her little almirah - and now I have gone and lost not one book but all four, which meant the entire family was wiped out from Ceylon in one fell blow, and that by me doing a damn fool thing - walking with a stupid dog all the way from Depanama.)</X></I>

 <p>For thousands of years, economies everywhere in the world were stagnant: they <w>didn't</w> achieve growth, although output fluc<l>tuated with weather patterns. Angus Maddison, in Phases Of Capitalist Development OUP, says that during the 1,000 years between 500<space>AD and 1500<space>AD, GDP grew by only 0.1 per cent a year. Growth began to accelerate around 1500<space>AD, and by 1700<space>AD, had doubled. In Britain, growth was just one per cent per year, and it took some 200 years to reach developed-country status. France and Germany took 150 years, the US 125 years and Japan 75 years. But East Asian Newly Industrialised Countries (NICs) such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan took only 50 years, while China has taken just 30 years to reach its present sta<l>tus - and it is expected to be the number-one economy in the world in another 10 years!</p>
 <p>Adam Smith pointed out that to achieve natural economic growth, nothing fancy is required. According to him: <X><quote>""Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy taxes and tolerable ad<l>ministration of justice - all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things.""</X></quote> To achieve faster growth, as in the case of the NICs, a special and vigorous effort is necessary.</p>
 <p>Paul Romer says: <X><quote>""Economic growth occurs whenever people take resources and rearrange them in ways that are more valu<l>able .""</quote></X> Labour is our most plentiful resource. But labour alone can<l>not produce. Labour must be combined with capital and land. And the organisation of the production process requires and en<l>trepreneur who must also take the risk of forsaking his or her cap<l>ital if he or she cannot sell output at a price that derives a profit.</p>
 <p>Karl Marx thought that all value is created by labour alone. But raw labour can produce little. Silicon is available in sea sand, but no amount of labour can produce a silicon chip from it. Unless capital and technology are applied to convert the raw Eppawala <O>picture1</O> <O>Media Services Photofile</O> phosphate into a form that is marketable, there is no wealth cre<l>ation. So labour requires capital and technology. Fortunately, we do not have to invent technology.</p>
 <p>Part of the existing stock of capital wears out each year. Hence, if output is to be sustained, the worn-out capital must be replaced. So a country needs replacement investment as well as new invest<l>ment - and it is this new investment that will determine the in<l>crease in output or GDP.</p> 
 <p>When labour works with more capital, it becomes more produc<l>tive. Similarly, with trained and skilled labour, more sophisticat<l>ed industrial products can be made. So a country must invest in training its labour force in the skills required. What about educa<l>tion? Economists think primary and secondary education play a role in improving the performance of labour. They downplay the role of university education. Part of the improvement in labour productivity is due to capital investment in machinery and equip<l>ment, and also investment in the knowledge and skills of labour.</p>
 <p>So who will invest in this? There is plenty of capital around the world. The trick is to attract investors. But how can this be done without a stable and peaceful environment? Can there be a stable business environment with militant trade unions dictating to a weak government - where strikes are endemic, where workers are overprotected and have to be paid expensive social-security con<l>tributions? How do we produce entrepreneurs who must take re<l>sponsibility for the whole process of production?</X></p></I>

This happens because the normal height upper floors are much stiffer and hence tend to behave as one block. Another source of irregularity is the introduction of large set backs in buildings. These introduce sudden changes in mass while may lead to unpredictable force distribution close to the set back in an earthquake event.
 
 Failure mechanisms of beams and columns: The modem trend in buildings is to maximise the spans while minimising the number of columns. This would necessitate beams of considerable depth where the column sizes are kept relatively small. In an event of an earthquake, the strong beam remain elastic while the weak columns suffer concrete crushing or shear failure. This may lead to the collapse of the building resulting in loss of life. In Sri Lanka, this aspect is not paid much attention by architects and structural design engineers. Therefore, small columns supporting large beams is a common sight in many existing buildings. 
 
 
 STRUCTURAL FORMS FOR BLAST AND EARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE 
 
 The desirable structural forms for blast and earthquake resistance are discussed with respect to the shape of the structure, symmetricity, distribution of strength and failure mechanisms of beams and columns. 
 
 Effects of shape: It is desirable to use plan shape' without re-entrant corners with respect to blast resistance since such corners can amplify the blast effects. Large re-entrant corners are not desirable with respect to earthquake resistance as well since they can make the structure irregular in shape. The geometric irregularities that can be acceptable on plan for regular structures are given in AS 1170/4 : 1993. When these limits are violated, the structure may need a dynamic analysis to determine distribution of earthquake forces. However, such an analysis is not a guarantee that the structure will have a desirable behaviour when geometric irregularities are substantial. Thus, when re-entrant corners are essential, those should be kept within the limits and the façade in such areas should be made resistant to blast loads by using an appropriate strong material such as concrete. The number of openings in such areas also should be minimised.
 
 Effects of symmetry: Irregular buildings, such as those with lateral load resisting strong elements arranged unsymmetrically, will be subjected to excessive torsional moments in large blasts and earthquakes. Therefore, even for buildings with irregular shapes in plan, every attempt should be made to ensure that the shear centre of strong elements of the building coincides with the line of action of forces. 
 
 Effects of distribution of strength: The use of double height lobby areas introduce soft stories in buildings. In such instances, it is advisable to introduce columns of cross sections larger than usually required. Such large columns would help to reduce the deflections and also the difference in stiffness. As a result, the rotational deformations of columns also will be reduced. Such columns can also be carefully detailed to provide them with sufficient ductility. thus avoiding brittle failure of columns. The use of earthquake resistant reinforcement details in these columns can enhance the confinement to concrete thus the rotational capacity of columns also will be improved. This measure will be of help with respect to blasts as well since large reinforced concrete columns would be able to resist blast effects much better due to their massive size and reserve strength. 
 
 Another source that introduces uneven distribution of strength is set-backs. With respect to blast resistance, it is desirable to have large set-backs in order to improve the stand-off for part of the building. However, this is not desirable with respect to earthquake resistance. Therefore, a compromise solution will be required for setbacks. It is recommended in AS 1170/4:1993 to have setbacks. When such recommendations are violated, it will be necessary to carryout dynamic analysis to determine the force distributions that may arise in earthquakes. However, such an analysis may not be a guarantee of satisfactory behaviour in an earthquake. Therefore, it is desirable to comply with the guidelines. When this is not possible due to functional requirements, it would be desirable to construct the projecting part of the building at ground floor level as a separate building. 
 
 Failure mechanisms of beams and columns: It may be advisable to avoid large span beams whenever possible with respect to earthquake resistance. Therefore, it is desirable to use smaller spans supported on large number of columns. In earthquakes, the use of detailing that improves the ductility will enhance the chances of survival of such beam column monolithic systems. In blasts also, the chances of the structure collapsing due to one or two columns being destroyed would be reduced since the upper part of the structure may now be able to behave as a very deep lattice girder. However, such a behaviour would not be possible when the number of columns are minimised by maximising the spans. 
 
 It can from above that the structural form can be selected in such a way so that the resistance to blast and earthquake effects can be enhanced. Therefore, for future public buildings constructed in Sri Lanka, these features should be carefully incorporated at least to some degree. 
 
 
 STRUCTURAL DETAILING FOR BLAST AND EARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE 
 
 The use of good structural forms alone is not sufficient in minimising the casualties in blasts earthquakes. Even monolithic structures with good structural forms can collapse due to lack of ductility. The structural detailing recommended in BS 8110 is adequate for static loading arising out of dead and live loads. However, when the structure is subjected to dynamic loading of high magnitudes, ductility offered by such detailing would be inadequate to prevent excessive damage. 
 
 Earthquake Resistant reinforcement Details
 
 It is impossible to resist earthquake loads on structures by relying either on the over-strength in the structure or the ductility of the structure. Relying on over-strength means designing of structures for larger load intensities than usual so that the resulting structure will be stronger than required under normal circumstances. Relying on ductility means enhancing the ductility of the members and the joints so that the structure is capable to undergoing large inelastic deformations without collapse when subjected to overloads (Mendis & Goldsworthy, 1995). The main drawback of designing for over-strength is that it does not eliminate the risk of the structure collapsing when the design loads are exceeded. However, designing for improved ductility may be able to prevent the total collapse of the structure even in an extreme event. According to AS 117014: 1993, it is possible to improve the ductility of structures by adopting the details recommended for intermediate moment resisting frames (IMRFs). The details adopted are quit similar to those recommended as earthquake resistant details by Dowrick ( 1977), Pinto (1987) etc. 
 
 When subjected to earthquakes, the points of contraflexure in columns change and columns can even be subjected to single curvature, thus leading to increases in bending moments  (Park & Paulay, 1975). Such changes occur due to the influences of higher mode of vibration, particularly second and third modes. Thus, in columns, plastic hinges and occur at the beam column junctions, and may cause destruction of columns due to crushing of concrete when the confinement is insufficient. According to Woodside (1995) that most of the buildings failures in Japans Kobe 1995 earthquake have occurred due to poor detailing of columns in buildings. In this earthquake, nearly 82,000 buildings had collapsed and a similar number suffered partial collapse. In order to avoid such failures, links in columns and location of splice bars will need special care. 
 
 The reinforcement details recommended for columns in Dowrick (1977) is given in Details Sheet No 1. It can be seen that the column reinforcement splices are locate away from beam column junctions since plastic hinges occur at these locations. The amount of links are also increased close to the beam column junctions. These details differ from the Standard Method of Detailing adopted in Sri Lanka where the link spacing is generally maintained at about 12 times the smallest vertical reinforcement bar diameter. The columns splices are also located just above the beam column junctions. Thus, it can be seen that the usual detailing practice adopted in Sri Lanka is quite inadequate for columns. Therefore, the chances of columns failing are quite high, which can lead to total collapse of buildings. As reported by Saaticioglu & Bruneau (1993), Mitchell & Tinawi (1992), in Erzincan 1992 and Costa-Rican 1991 earthquakes also many buildings with poor column details were completely destroyed. In many other buildings, damage was disproportionate to the magnitude of the earthquake that had occurred. 
 
 In an earthquake, there is an acceleration in the vertical direction in addition to those in lateral directions. These vertical accelerations can induce moment reversals in beams. The change of point of contraflexure in columns can also contribute to this. Thus, beams will need some reverse moment capacity, which means the sections subjected to primarily sagging will need a certain amount of hogging moment capacity and vice versa. 
 
 According to recommendations given in AS 3600 (1994), the area of bottom reinforcement provided at support face should be able to resist one third of the design hogging moment when acting in reverse direction. This will help the beam to resist moment reversals resulting due to earthquake loads. It will also ensure proper anchorage of bottom reinforcement specially at external columns. It is necessary to ensure that at an section, the beam can resist either a sagging or a hogging moment of one fifth the magnitude of the maximum hogging moment provided at either support. These details are indicated in Detail Sheet No: 2. These recommendations are a deviation from the normal practice adopted in Sri Lanka, and it may result in some increase in top longitudinal reinforcement at span sections. 
 
 In an earthquake, the beam column junctions also will be subjected to extra shear forces and tensile stresses that may not exist with static behaviour, which can lead to cracking. Therefore, beam column junctions also will need extra links to prevent failure of concrete (Mendis and Goldsworthy, 1995). These additional link can prevent cracks that can lead to deterioration of bond between reinforcement and concrete, thus causing significant strength and stiffness degradation. Once a joint fails, the capacity to transfer seismic and gravity loads can be lost, possibly resulting in partial or complete collapse of the structure. The extra links required are shown in Detail Sheet No: I. This is an important deviation from the detailing recommended in Standard Method of Detailing as practiced in Sri Lanka. In the general details adopted, no links are provided within the depth of the beam at beam column junctions. 
 
 I can be seen that the adoption of earthquake resistant detailing in moment resisting frames is not a difficult task. The extra reinforcement required will mainly be necessary to prevent crushing failure of concrete by providing additional shear links. The extra main reinforcement requirement will be limited only to lightly loaded beams where small diameter hanger bars would need replacement with larger bars. 
 
 Blast resistant Reinforcement Details
 
 When reinforced concrete elements are dynamically loaded due to blasts, the elements deflect until such time as the strain energy of the element is developed sufficiently to balance the energy delivered by the blast load. If this energy cannot be developed without fracture, then fragmentation of concrete will occur. Therefore, special details are required, which will ensure load carrying capacity of the member, even when fragmentation of concrete does occur. This can be achieved by providing compression reinforcement that is equal to the tension reinforcement provided. In the presence of adequate links, such beams will be able to carry significantly high loads (Institution of Structural Engineers, 1995). This detail is required only for the ground and first floor beams where the blast effects can be quite severe. This means that the blast resistant construction of beams will need a further increase in reinforcement to resist moment reversals than those specified for earthquake resistance at these levels.
 
 It is recommended that the joint details shown in Figure 4 should b~ used at beam column junctions (The Institution of Structural Engineers, 1995). However, with this detail, the beams reinforcement is anchored in the column where plastic hinges can occur in earthquakes. This recommendation is therefore not desirable with respect to earthquake details. The reason for such recommendation is to ensure that the beam will not separate from the column, when no links are provided within the depth of the beam. However, in earthquake detailing as shown in Detail Sheet No 1, there are links provided for the column reinforcement within the depth of the beam. These links will be able to prevent the separation of the beam and the column even when the beam reinforcement is anchored within the depth of the beam. Therefore, it would be advisable to comply with earthquake resistant details recommended for beam column junctions with respect to both earthquakes and details.
 
 The blast pressure that enter the structure through the shattered windows and the failed curtain walls will load the underside and subsequently the top surfaces of the floor slabs along the height of the building. There will be a brief time for which floors will receive a net upward loading (Ettouney et al., 1996, Mainstone, 1976). This upward load requires that the slab be reinforced to resist loads opposing the effects of gravity. It is recommended that top reinforcement should be provided over the complete area of first floor slabs and ground floors which have been designed as suspended (The Institution of Structural Engineers, 1995). This is a deviation from the earthquake detailing where continuation of top and bottom reinforcement is required only in cantilever slabs. This is a deviation from the normal details adopted in Sri Lanka for slabs as well. 
 
 When concrete columns are subjected to blast loads, there is a possibility for total elimination of a column. In such instances, the upper floor columns and beams can act as a lattice girder when the number of upper floors are large and those are capable of  forming a lattice girder. However, in low rise buildings such as those with less than five floors, it is possible that adequate ties are not provided and hence may not be able to form such lattice girders. It should be noted that ties are specified for building having five or more storeys in BS 8110 (1985). It is suggested by Elliot et a1. (1992) that even a building with less than five floors should be designed such that removal of one element will cause only local collapse. Therefore, the provision of ties should be adopted for two storey and above for reinforced concrete buildings that will be constructed in Sri Lanka in future. 
 
 These indicates that adoption of the earthquake resistant detailing in reinforced concrete structures will be able to improve the structure to comply with most of the blast resistant requirements. The extra details are required only in beams and slabs located above the ground and first floor levels.</X></p></I>

 <#> <bold> TURLOUGHS </bold> </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> TURLOUGHS are lakes which disappear for part of the year, leaving a floor covered with grasses, sedges and herbs. <#> They occur in limestone areas west of the Shannon and are unique to Ireland. <#> Their flora and fauna are very interesting, and if there is one in your area, it is an ideal site for an environmental study. <#> Many turloughs have been drained and both arterial drainage and local drainage by farmers threaten those that remain. <#> Some representative turloughs should be conserved, as it would be a tragedy if this unique part of our heritage were to disappear forever. </bold> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> SEASONAL LAKES </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> If you drive through part of eastern Galway or Mayo in the winter, you will see a large number of lakes and you may be puzzled that they do not appear on the half-inch to a mile Ordnance Survey maps. <#> If you look a bit closer, you may wonder why some of the lakes have walls leading down into them, or telegraph poles in the middle of them. <#> Then, if you return to the area in the summer, you will find no sign of these lakes, but instead a landscape with green fields and grazing cattle. <#> Only a few clues, such as the black moss covering the stone walls, indicate that these are no ordinary fields. <#> In fact, they are turloughs.</p>
 <p> <#> Turlough, or <it> turlach </it> , is the word used to describe these strange disappearing lakes which are found in limestone areas of Ireland, mostly west of the Shannon. <#> The name is thought to come from the Irish ""tur loch"", meaning dry lake. <#> The features are unique to Ireland and they are an important part of our heritage. <#> They are of great interest to many scientists: geomorphologists (who study landforms) are interested in how turloughs were formed, hydrologists (who study water) try to explain what makes turloughs flood, botanists study the unusual vegetation which covers the <}> <-> turloughs </-> <+> turlough 's </+> </}> floor and zoologists study the animals associated with the turloughs. <#> Because they have so many interesting aspects, turloughs provide an ideal opportunity for local environmental studies. </p>
 <p> <#> Turloughs are mostly found on the central lowlands west of the Shannon, in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo and Roscommon, although a few are also found elsewhere, e.g. in Limerick, Sligo and Longford. <#> Most turloughs flood in the autumn, usually some time in October, and then dry up some time between April and July. <#> However, some turloughs in the Burren can flood at any time of year in a matter of a few hours after heavy rainfall and they may empty again a few days later. <#> A few turloughs are affected by the tide: in the summer, Caherglassaun Lough, which is 5 km from Galway Bay, can be seen to flood and empty again twice every 24 hours. <#> Most turloughs flood to a depth of about 2 metres but some are much deeper: for example, some of the turloughs near Gort are about five metres (16 ft.) deep in midwinter. <#> Turloughs are variable in size: the largest turlough in Ireland, Rahasane, which lies to the west of Craughwell in Co. Galway, covers about 250 hectares (or 500 football pitches!).</p>
 <h> <bold> <#> WHY DO TURLOUGHS OCCUR? </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> All of the turloughs are found in limestone areas. <#> This is because limestone is a unique rock in that it can be dissolved away by rainwater, particularly rainwater that has become acidic by picking up carbon dioxide as it passes through the soil. <#> The cracks or <it> joints </it> in the rock become widened to such an extent that eventually all of the rain falling on the limestone disappears underground and the water moves through the rock openings ranging from cracks a few millimetres wide to large cave passages. <#> The limestone is then said to <it> karstified </it> . <#> To the east of the Shannon, the limestone is often covered by great thicknesses of glacial drift deposited during the Ice Age but in many areas to the west of the Shannon where the limestone is pure and the drift cover is thin, there is no proper surface river network. <#> In these areas, rainfall disappears underground, flows through openings in the rock and then rises at springs: large springs are found to the west of the area, flowing into Lough Corrib and Galway Bay. <#> In winter, when the underground water level (or <it> water table </it> ) rises, and when the underground flow routes to the springs are not capable of dealing with the amount of water entering them, groundwater may appear temporarily at the surface in the form of a turlough. <#> Many of the rivers seen in these areas today are largely artificial, constructed by drainage engineers from the nineteenth century to the present day, often linking a series of turloughs. <#> For example, much of the Clare river is artificial and the middle section of its course used to be a huge turlough - the largest in Ireland at 650 hectares.</p>
 <h> <bold> <#> SWALLOW HOLES </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Turloughs usually fill and empty at particular places on the floor: sometimes an actual hold or passage is visible but more often a hollow with stones in the bottom is all that can be seen and it may not be easy to recognise when it is dry in midsummer. <#> Some turloughs have a spring at one place and a swallow hole somewhere else on the floor where water drains away, but many turloughs fill and empty through the same hole. <#> A few turloughs are filled by rivers and streams flowing into them as well by water rising from underground.</p>
 <p> <#> The water sinking in the swallow hole travels underground to a spring, which may be several kilometres away. <#> In most rock types, groundwater flows very slowly (from just a few centimetres to a few metres per day), but in karstified limestone the flow rate can be quite rapid: water from the turlough may flow underground to a spring at a rate of 100 metres per hour or more. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> CALCIUM CARBONATE </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Limestone is made up of the mineral calcium carbonate and as water passes through limestone, it dissolves the calcium carbonate - this is what makes the water hard and causes furring on the inside of kettles, as the calcium carbonate comes out of solution when the water is heated. <#> Something rather similar happens in turloughs - water which has picked up a lot of calcium carbonate during its underground travel rises in the turloughs and then some of the calcium carbonate comes out of solution and forms a white deposit. <#> So if you visit a turlough which has emptied recently, you may notice a whitish coating on the vegetation on the turlough floor. <#> (The reason why the calcium carbonate is deposited is that when the water comes to the surface in a turlough, it loses carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere and to plants which use it for photosynthesis and this loss causes the calcium carbonate to come out of solution.) </p>
 <p> <#> Sometimes a special whitish deposit which has the appearance of sheets of paper is found in the turloughs when they dry up. <#> This ""algal paper"" is made up of filaments of an alga which grows abundantly in warm weather and is then left to dry out in sheets when the turlough empties. </p>
 <p> <#> If you look at a section in a drainage ditch in a turlough, or if you make a hole with a soil auger, you may find a white or cream coloured deposit beneath the vegetation cover, or beneath a layer of peat. <#> This is often called ""white marl"" - again it is made of calcium carbonate. <#> About half of the turloughs contain marl: it was deposited at a time several thousand years ago when these turloughs were not seasonal lakes but were flooded all year round. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Most turloughs have a springy, short-cropped turf of grasses, sedges and herbs. <#> In the Burren, the highwater-mark is often shown by the shrubby cinquefoil with its attractive yellow flowers, and meadow rue. <#> Just below, dog violets are abundant and in some turloughs there may be a dense sward of the rare sky-blue turlough violet about one metre further down. <#> Other characteristic plant of turlough sides include orchids and speedwell. <#> About half way down the sides, and across the bottom of shallow turloughs, silverweed may blanket almost all other plants. </p>
 <p> <#> If the turlough has a marshy zone near the swallow hole, there may be mint, water-cress, pond-weeds, aquatic buttercups and knotgrass, living a semi-terrestrial existence. <#> But most swallow holes when dry are represented by a jumble of rocks, clothes with blackish and dried aquatic mosses (<it> Cinclidotus </it> , the turlough moss and <it> Fontinalis </it> , usually found in streams). </p>
 <p> <#> Many people think that turloughs have no animal life. <#> However, frogs and newts may spawn there and sticklebacks may survive in the larger turloughs, retreating into underground cracks in the rock when waters are low. <#> Shrimp and water-lice do the same and where fish are absent there may be a rich fauna of delicate water-fleas and fairy-shrimp, some unknown elsewhere in Ireland. <#> These hatch and grow fast, finding safety in the warm fishless waters. <#> Flatworms and snails are also often abundant; these pass the dry periods in springmouths or marshy areas. </p>
 <p> <#> When turloughs retain some water all year, they may be important bird haunts. <#> Rahasane in Galway is famous for its white-fronted geese, whooper swans, wigeon, teal and many waders in winter. <#> Others may not suit the large migratory birds, but their importance to resident warblers and other small birds has never been studied. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> DRAINING OF TURLOUGHS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Turloughs provide good summer grazing for cattle, sheep and horses, partly because of the annual deposition of lime-rich silt. <#> However, for many years, farmers have seen the winter flooding as a waste of potential and they have attempted to find some means of draining the turloughs, so that they can be used all year round. <#> This has usually been achieved by digging an artificial channel through the turlough, which is capable of carrying away any water entering the turlough from surface or groundwater - such channels have often been constructed as part of major arterial drainage schemes. <#> At least a third of the turloughs in Ireland have already been drained and more are being drained each year. <#> This has very serious consequences from the point of view of the environmentalist - the unique flora and fauna of the turlough cannot survive in the absence of seasonal flooding. <#> Even for the farmer, the benefits are not always as great as anticipated - the stopping of the annual limey silt deposition means that the soil may become impoverished and fertilisers must be used. <#> Also, the poorly developed, delicate soil may not be able to withstand the presence of animals through the winter. </p>
 <p> <#> To suggest that no more turloughs should be drained is a rather extreme view but the case for conserving at least some of them is very strong - it would be a great loss if this unique part of our heritage were to disappear for ever. </p>

 <h> <ul> <#> THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN LEARNING </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> The term 'learning' is a scientific construction based on observations of behaviour in repeated situations. <#> The Oxford dictionary defines learning as <quote> ""getting knowledge of, or skill in, by study and/or experience"" </quote>, whilst the Encyclopedia <}> <-> Brittanica </-> <+> Britannica </+> </}> defines the term as <quote> ""the alteration of an individual 's behaviour as the result of experience"" </quote>. </p>
 <p> <#> Borger and Seaborne (1996) define learning as <quote> ""any more or less permanent change of behaviour which is the result of experience"" </quote>, as they contend that <quote> ""to consider learning is to consider how the interaction between an individual and his environment brings about changes in the way in which he tends to behave"" </quote>. <#> Piaget (1969) explains learning as <quote> ""involving adaptation to the environment and organisation of experience by means of action, memory, perceptions and other kinds of mental activities </quote>, whilst Gagn&/e (1967) defines learning as <quote> ""a change in human disposition of capability which can be retained and which is not simply ascribable to the process of growth"" </quote>. <#> He qualifies his definition by explaining that the kind of change called learning exhibits itself as a change in behaviour, and the inference of learning is made by comparing what behaviour was possible before the individual was placed in a <quote> ""learning situation"" </quote> and what behaviour can be exhibited after such treatment. <#> This change he contends, must have more than momentary permanence. <#> It must be capable of being retained over some period of time and it must be distinguishable from the kind of change that is attributable to growth, such as a change in height or the development of muscles through exercise. </p>
 <p> <#> Hilgard and Atkinson (1975) also contend that as not all behavioural changes are caused by learning, any definition of learning must exclude such changes. <#> Thus they define learning as <quote> ""a relatively permanent change in human behaviour that occurs as the result of prior experience"" </quote>. <#> They explain that the phrase <quote> ""relatively permanent"" </quote> excludes changes in behaviour that result from temporary or transient conditions such as fatigue or the influence of drugs. <#> Also, by specifying that learning is the result of ""experience"", they too are excluding behavioural changes that are due to maturation, disease, or physical damage. </p>
 <p> <#> Boyd, Apps et al (1980) in their deliberations about the concept of learning draw a definite distinction between education and learning. <#> They contend that the term ""education"" emphasises the educator, the agent of change who presents stimuli and reinforcement for learning and designs activities to induce change, whilst in contrast the term ""learning"" emphasises the person in whom the change occurs or is expected to occur. <#> They define learning as <quote> ""the act or process by which behavioural change, knowledge, skills, and attitudes are acquired"" </quote>. </p>
 <p> <#> On the other hand, Smith (1982) suggest that the term ""learning"" defies precise definition because it is put to multiple uses. <#> This is because, he argues, that the term ""learning"" is used to refer to (1) the acquisition and mastery of what is already known about something, (2) the extension and clarification of meaning of one 's experience, or (3) an organised, intentional process of testing ideas relevant to problems. <#> In other words, the concept of learning is as he states, <quote> ""used to describe a product, a process, or a function"" </quote>. </p>
 <p> <#> Thus although the problem of defining what the concept of learning is, has been the source of much discussion in the literature, it would appear that there exists agreement that the one basic requirement of learning is that some ""change"" must take place within the individual, with a learning skill being a way of organising and co-ordinating learning activity so that there is a retained change in the individual. </p>
 <p> <#> It would, however, be tempting to think that all one needed to do to turn people into skilled learners would be to identify the skills, ways, decisions and experiences needed and then tell the students about them. <#> But that is not the way one learns a skill, for, as Downs and Perry (1984) state <quote> ""being told about welding does not produce a skilled welder, as practice in welding with feedback is vital for the skill to develop."" </quote> <#> <}> <-> Similarily </-> <+> Similarly </+> </}>, if we want someone to improve their learning skills then they must practise and get feedback on their skills. <#> This can only take place through continual learning and feedback and reflection on both what is learned and how it is learned. <#> In addition, if as Borger and Seabourne (1966) state <quote> ""to consider learning is to consider how the interaction between an individual and his environment brings about changes in the way in which he tends to behave,"" </quote> then it would appear important for the teacher to be aware of the previously experienced learning strategies to which his or her students have been accustomed, as their expectation of the learning event will be influenced by the way in which experience has made him or her capable to respond to a learning stimulus. <#> Thus, later in this study, I would propose to examine if in relation to student nurses, an understanding of their expectations of the learning event by the nurse teacher, would enable him or her to shape the specific behaviour of such students, whose maturity, previously attained level of knowledge, and past experience of organising their interactions with the environment will influence their expectations of any learning situation. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> THE CONCEPT OF ADULT LEARNING </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> The concept of adult learning, which Elsdon (1975) describes as <quote> ""a movement from the familiar into the unfamiliar, a step in the dark which requires courage"" </quote> is not a new phenomenon, since man has had to learn to adapt continually to changing environments in order to survive. <#> However, as McCrea (1988) argues, the concept of the learning process which changes the adult 's way of responding as a result of environmental experience has changed over time as new learning needs emerged and studies of adult learning provided new knowledge of the processes of adult learning. </p>
 <p> <#> Piaget (1969) stated that <quote> ""the principal goal of education is to create men capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done"" </quote>. <#> Although, at the time Piaget was referring to the education of children, this quotation would be applicable to the adult learning situation, in so far as the object of adult education involves learning in the context of accumulated experience, skill, knowledge, opinions and prejudices, and building on these foundations, in addition to assisting mature people to change, accept new knowledge and learn to cope with a changing environment. <#> For, although the adult student 's learning experiences will be at least partly coloured by his or her school experience, there are differences between the adult student and the school pupil in relation to the learning situation. <#> For example, the former will no longer accept imposed discipline as a child will and is therefore more likely to become vocal if the depths of poor learning circumstances are analysed. </p>
 <p> <#> In addition, in contrast to the child who is bound by law to go to school, the adult 's motivation for learning will be varied. <#> Consequently, in the adult learning environment, a teacher faced with a class of mixed standards and interests may have little time for a depth analysis of motivation. <#> However, Jones (1969) contends that in the concept of adult learning, what is much more important than a depth-analysis of motivation is the student 's self concept in the class. <#> He, therefore, argues that the teacher should be aware of the picture that the student has in his own mind of what he is doing there, what he expects of the teacher, of the subject and of the other students, and how he relates his attendance at class with all his other concerns and responsibilities. </p>
 <p> <#> That students have the ability to learn has never been denied, although it has been said that learning is mainly undertaken in childhood and that the ability to learn, and therefore intelligence, decline as the adult ages. <#> But as research has shown in recent years the age limit on learning performance may not occur before 75 years (Cross 1979). <#> New concerns in the concept of lifelong learning have emerged as research on adult learning and development have become more well-known. <#> These findings have relevance for the learning potential of student nurses. <#> Research has shown, for example, Cross (1981), that adult learning and the methods by which adults learn are quite distinct from those that have been developed to date for the education of children but which have also been used in the education of adults. </p>
 <p> <#> Consequently, the art and science of helping adults to learn, termed Andragogy, and which Birchenhall (1985) informs one is defined by Meizrow (1983) as <quote> ""an organised and sustained effort to assist adults to learn in a way that enhances their capability to function as self directed learners"" </quote>, is a topic which has received in recent years considerable scientific investigation. <#> I would now like to comment upon this in relation to its relevance regarding the concept of adult learning. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> THE THEORY OF ANDRAGOGY </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> McCrea (1988) reminds one that the term andragogy first appeared in the literature in 1833 and was used to refer to the normal natural process of lifelong learning for adults. <#> Unfortunately, however, it was not until the late 1950's that writers on adult learning (Kidd 1959: Millar 1964: Knowles 1970) began to look critically at adult learning and to develop a theory of andragogy. </p>
 <p> <#> Knowles (1970), who defined andragogy as the art and science of helping adults to learn, cited four major characteristics relevant to andragogy, namely, self concept, experience, readiness to learn and orientation to learning. <#> Tibbles (1977) highlights how an examination of these four characteristics in adult learners would indicate that they are qualitatively different from those in child learners on which traditional pedagogy is based. </p>
 <p> <#> The first characteristic is the difference in self concept. <#> In contrast to children who tend to see themselves as dependent persons, adults perceive themselves as responsible self-directing individuals. <#> As Knowles (1970) states <quote> ""adulthood is the point at which an individual comes to see himself as being essentially self-directing"" </quote>. <#> Thus, an adult who views him or herself as being self-directing, and has, a need to be treated with respect, make his or her own decisions, and as Tibbles (1977) states, <quote> ""be seen as an important and unique individual"" </quote>. <#> Self-concept is therefore, concerned with the greater independence of adults. <#> This implies that learning situations should ideally allow for as much participation by learners as possible and suggests that if adults are placed in learning situations that do not incorporate their learning needs, they may resist learning. </p>
 <p> <#> The second characteristic is experience. <#> Knowles (1970) argues that as individuals mature they accumulate an expanding reservoir of experience that becomes an increasingly rich resource for learning and at the same time provides them with a broadening base to which to relate new learnings. <#> Experience is therefore, particularly significant with regard to adult learners because of the amount and variety of previous experience gained. <#> This implies, however, that transmission techniques of traditional teaching should be replaced by <}> <-> experiental </-> <+> experiential </+> </}> techniques which tap the experience of learners and involve them in analysing their experiences (McCrea 1988). <#> In addition, this experience can also contribute to the learning of others, a factor highlighted by Cooper (1972), who from her study of the adult nurse learners ascertained that <quote> ""nurses need to learn to respect each other 's knowledge and skills so that they can take advantage of this rich resource as they continue to learn"" </quote>. </p>
 <p> <#> The third characteristic is readiness. <#> Readiness is concerned with the timing of learning, that is, adults are ready to learn material relevant to their life situation. <#> In contrast to children whose readiness to learn is related to both biological development and social pressures, adults develop their readiness to learn as a result of the requirements of their various social roles. <#> Consequently, adult learners will display a variety of stages and demonstrate a diversity of readiness, depending on the relationship between their past experiences and new ideas, or what Cooper (1972) describes as their <quote> ""points of contact"" </quote>. <#> It is therefore crucial that a particular learning experience meets the adult learner 's needs if his or her readiness to learn is to be maximised. <#> To achieve this, the use of past experiences in relation to new ideas could be a useful technique, whilst grouping learners so that common requirements can be worked on together is another consideration. </p>
 <p> <#> The fourth characteristic is orientation to learning. <#> It is allied to two key factors, topic and time, by relating to a change in time perspective from one of postponed application of knowledge to immediacy of application, resulting in an orientation towards learning shifting from subject centred to problem centred. <#> In contrast to children, adults focus more on problems than on subject matter and desire immediacy of application rather than a reference to the future. <#> It is, however, necessary to point out that according to Tibbles (1977) there is now evidence that this is not invariably the case. <#> Nonetheless, it is still considered that this perspective of postponed application in children has created an orientation towards subject-centred learning, and in adults the time perspective of immediacy has produced a problem-centredness towards learning. </p>

 <h> <#> <bold> Broadside Ballads and Irish Society: An Examination of the Themes of Religion and Love <bold> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Colin Neilands </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The cultural contextualisation of broadside ballads, certainly within Ireland, has received relatively little, and only selective, attention to date. <#> Such treatment as there is has focused for the most part on political or historical themes. <#> Since these are the major themes of Irish broadside output (see Table One), they obviously merit examination, but what of the broadsides with other themes? </p>
 <p> <#> This article seeks to interweave social history as portrayed in the ballads, with that presented by more ""conventional"" historical sources, i.e. historical textbooks. <#> This is not in itself a novel approach, as it has been employed, for example, in the many works of Roy Palmer <sp> 2 </sp>, and was also attempted with an Irish context in Mulcahy and Fitzgibbons ' <it> The Voice of the People. </it> <sp> 3 </sp> <#> However, the difficulty with this approach is that often authors have taken history as their starting-point and simply used the ballads to illustrate or exemplify; with the vast range in ballad material available, it is not difficult to find suitable examples. <#> But what of the opposite direction - i.e. taking the ballads as the starting point and then turning to history to give them points of reference? <#> If the ballads are <quote> ""the voice of the people"" </quote>, as in Mulcahy and Fitzgibbons ' book, surely they must be the first point of reference. <#> In this approach, we are able to see which issues, events, or figures were judged important by ""the people"" (however they are to be defined) and then relate these to the mainstream perception of history to draw out points of comparison. </p>
 <p> <#> Ballads, perhaps particularly broadside ballads, having an origin and audience primarily from a very different part of society from that producing scholarly historical works, obviously present a different perspective on a country 's history. <#> With increasing awareness of the narrowness of a conventional historical perspective, a wider variety of alternative sources has come to be employed in an attempt to perceive life from the point of view of the majority, rather than a minority. <#> The use of such sources not only reveals a different conception of the importance of events and people, but places political history in a broader context, where it is much less dominant. <#> With this alternative approach, history is not solely about political happenings at home and abroad, but presents a much wider picture encompassing many more aspects of life of more constant and immediate concern to the majority of the population - economic problems, the family, love relationships, entertainment, etc. </p>
 <p> <#> The use of broadside ballads as such a source for examining nineteenth-century Ireland reveals that while political history may be the largest overall theme, it still accounts for only one in four out of the total (see Table One below). <#> This article examines two of the other broadside themes - religion and love - which focus on issues which are central to the life of any nation or community. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Ballads on Religion and Belief <sp> 4 </sp> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The nineteenth century is usually viewed as the period when the Catholic Church really came to the fore as a dominant, shaping force in Irish life, especially after the Emancipation Act of 1829. <#> The Church increasingly sought to exercise its control over the lives of the people, as well as identifying still further with nationalist politics. <#> This was a period of great growth for the Church when many of the practices and institutions which are now an intrinsic part of the faith were first introduced. <#> Because of all this activity and the increasing pervasiveness of the Church throughout the island, and in all aspects of life, religious history has much to say on this period. <sp> 5 </sp> <#> For the broadsides, however, the Church, and matters relating, appear to have evoked less of an interest. </p>
 <p> <#> That broadside ballads on religion and belief have received little attention then, may not be altogether surprising as they seem to form only about seven percent of the total broadside output. <sp> 6 </sp> <#> This figure appears to indicate a popular interest somewhat at odds with what has been termed <quote> ""the devotional revolution"" </quote> <sp> 7 </sp> which occurred in Ireland in the nineteenth century. <#> However, the fact that such ballads occurred at all, particularly in a medium generally held in low esteem, is perhaps an indication of the strength of religious fervour in Ireland during the last century, such that it penetrated all strata of society and utilised all manner of media of expression. <#> These religious ballads fall into four main categories - on Churches (i.e. buildings), on the Clergy, on Faith, and on the Supernatural - and these categories have been used for the statistical analysis presented in Table Two (see following page). </p>
 <p> <#> For the purposes of this article the material in these broadsides will be discussed under two general categories - the Church, and Belief - each accounting for roughly half of the total number of 179 broadsides on the general theme. </p>
 <p> <#> The two main areas of interest of the broadsides with regard to the Church as an institution were the construction or renovation of church buildings, and the clergy. <#> The first of these inspired only nine broadsides, despite appearing to graphically illustrate the changing fortunes of the Church and surely evoking pride on the part of the parishioners involved. <#> The building programme was quite extensive and would have had a marked effect on the worship of a large number of Catholics throughout Ireland. <#> The change in the appearance of church buildings was often quite dramatic, with parishes formerly worshipping in a low, thatched construction, similar to ordinary dwellings, now blessed with architecturally designed dressed-stone buildings, often in a Gothic style. <#> The ballads themselves enthuse as to the beauties of these new edifices and the related glory of the clergy, the Church, and God (see ""A New Song in Praise of the Catholic Church of Kanturk""). <#> But the low number of broadsides suggests that other issues were of greater interest to the people. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Table 2: Broadside Ballads on Religion and Belief - Occurrences and Percentages </bold> </h> <&> table inserted </&>
 <p> <#> If the broadsides are to be believed, the single most important manifestation of the Church was the parish priest, with ballads on the clergy (mostly at parish priest level, though occasionally rising to bishop) accounting for almost half the broadsides on this theme (eighty out of 179, as indicated in Table Two above). <#> The predominance of the priest as a broadside subject is also reflective of nineteenth-century changes as a rise in the social standing of the priesthood and improved education facilities led to an increase in the number of priests available for service, so that parishes no longer had to go without, or make do with poorly-educated, perhaps even rather uninterested, clergy. <#> These changes also led to greater centralised control over the activities and performance of parish priests even in far-flung corners of the country. <#> Increasingly the priest became the focal point of the local community, acting as an important social as well as religious symbol for his parishioners. <#> It is therefore not surprising that such a figure should have been the inspiration for popular song. </p>
 <p> <#> For the most part, the ballads on priests are praise songs, either eulogies or elegies, conforming to the stereotype images which were prevalent throughout various forms of popular literature at that time. <sp> 8 </sp> <#> The clergy were painted in terms placing them on the celestial scale only slightly lower than the saints or angels, as ideal(ised) servants of God on earth (see ""An Elegy on the Death of the Much Lamented Doctor D.M. O'Brien""). <#> The only incident inspiring broadside treatment which pours anything but the highest praise on the Catholic Clergy was the case of the turncoat bishop, when, in 1786, John Butler, the Bishop of Cork, abandoned the Catholic faith in order to inherit a title and estates denied him under the terms of the Penal Laws. <#> This sensational incident appears to have remained in the folk mind for some time, in that the two broadsides based on this occurrence are clearly of nineteenth century origin. </p>
 <p> <#> Since the priests had such a high social standing and public image, it is not surprising that when unusual circumstances did occur, these should merit broadside attention - whether it was a murder, or a sensational trial, with sexual accusations. <#> If based on actual events, as was probably the case, none of these would have been common occurrences, which only further explains the attention of the broadsides. <#> After all, even in the secular times of our own age, it can still make headline news in the popular press if a member of the clergy is seen to, or is thought to, stray from the approved line. <#> The broadsides, however, were always careful to emphasise the absolute innocence of the priests involved. <#> While cashing in on the public desire for sensationalism, the broadside writers and printers had no wish, it seems, to actually discredit a member of the clergy. <#> The shock of the scandal and the subsequent attention given to these unusual occurrences only serves to emphasise further the high level of interest in these public servants. </p>
 <p> <#> The Church, then, while perhaps not inspiring a quantity of broadsides equal to its growing importance in nineteenth-century Ireland, is seen to have attracted great loyalty and devotion, particularly for its priests. <#> The broadsides probably bring the reality of the Church for the people down to a more immediate level, revealing the personal impact of parish priests, who frequently acted as vital supports for their communities. <#> The more abstract power and symbolism of the Church, as represented here by the church buildings, seem to have stirred lesser feelings. </p>
 <p> <#> Turning to the second category of the broadsides - Belief - these ballads in turn divide in two: those covering aspects of the people 's belief system approved by the Church, and those on practices and beliefs not approved by the Church. </p>
 <p> <#> Ballads on Church-approved matters of faith include stories based on the Bible, or on the lives of certain saints, declarations of faith, and denominational debates (the latter introducing the issue of interdenominational marriage). <#> Some of the songs are very pious, almost prayers or hymns, rather out of keeping with the general tone and content of broadside ballads, and frequently of a higher than usual literary standard. <#> The sensationalism of trails and murder, the topicality of praise songs and elegies, and the likely commercial popularity of attacks on Protestantism, all make obvious topics for broadsides, but ballads of purely religious content seem almost out of place in this medium. </p>
 <p> <#> Most of the ballads based on Biblical stories depict the life of Christ, particularly the details surrounding His birth and death. <#> Little or no attention is given to the teachings of Christ and no mention is made of one of the central tenets of Christian faith, namely, the resurrection. <#> This concentration on the Passion and crucifixion of Christ, often described in graphic and gory detail (see ""On the Love of Jesus""), may be a reflection of one of the many innovations in religious worship during the nineteenth century which was to become one of the most popular: the devotion of the Passion of the Sacred Heart. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> MUCH RESENTMENT TO DRINK DRIVING LAWS </h> </bold>
 <p> <bold> <#> The new drink driving laws have been received with anger and resentment by most members of the public and licensed vintners to such an extent that, if there was an election in the near future, the matter would almost certainly be a major issue. </p> </bold>
 <p> <#> Every person the ""Munster Express"" spoke to on the subject this week was at pains to suggest that they did not condone drunk driving in any way. <#> But they felt the new laws were unsocial and draconian and an attack on ordinary law abiding citizens at a time when muggers, vandals and burglars were terrorising the community. </p>
 <p> <#> It also emerged that there was no animosity towards rank and file members of the Garda Siochana who are seen as people merely doing their job. <#> But there was much bitterness against the politicians who introduced the legislation and the fact that so many officers have been diverted to check-point duties. </p>
 <p> <#> In a separate development, which could have a bearing on the controversy, the Garda Representative Association expressed <quote> ""serious concern"" </quote> this week at the decision of the Commissioner to introduce a new staff appraisal system for gardai. </p>

 <p> <#> The mood of the people was also evident on RTE 's ""Questions and Answers"" on Monday night when, in a show of hands, the vast majority of the audience showed their opposition to the new laws. <#> A return to the status quo and a scale of fines and punishments, depending on the concentration of alcohol involved, were the options most favoured. </p>
 <p> <#> A suggestion by Ms. Avril Doyle, T.D., of Fine Gael that Ireland adopt the French system of dealing with drunk drivers has also been finding much support in recent days. <#> In France, the punishment matches the concentration and the consequences of a ban on the defendant 's spouse and children is also taken into consideration. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> 1. Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> For several years now members of the international radiation protection community have been expressing anxiety about the effect of natural radiation on the health of persons. <#> It is expected that this concern will be given concrete expression in this country when the Building Regulations are introduced. <#> They are expected to call for precautions to be taken to avoid danger to the health of occupants of buildings caused by radioactive substances in the ground under buildings. <#> This will include radon which is a radioactive gas. </p>
 <p> <#> Designers of buildings will be faced with a problem in complying with this requirement. <#> This arises firstly, due to the difficulty in predicting prior to construction the likelihood of harmful levels of indoor radon <}> <-> occuring </-> <+> occurring </+> </}> in the completed building and secondly, in advising on the type and extent of any precautions that should be taken at the design stage. <#> There is also the matter of legal liability. <#> It would be prudent at the present time for designers of houses, schools and certain other buildings of long time occupation, to raise the matter of radon protection with their clients, as otherwise, with the widespread awareness of the radiation problem, they could be held to be guilty of professional negligence. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 2. Facts about Radon </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> About 13 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total radiation exposure is made up from man-made nuclear and medical activities and the remaining 87 <*> per cent sign </*> from natural sources. <#> Exposure to any form of radiation may cause harm to the exposed person or his or her descendants and there is no intrinsic difference between artificial and natural radiation in their biological effects. <#> In contrast to the demand for strict controls over exposure to artificial radiation sources, relatively little attention has been given to control of exposures to natural sources. <#> This may have arisen partly from a feeling that what is natural is without harm and also from a lack of awareness about precautions which could be taken. <#> However, in recent years there has been a growing concern among those dealing with radiation matters about the long <}> <-> terms </-> <+> term </+> </}> effects of radiation at all levels and the circumstances where exposure could, and probably should, be reduced. <#> This is particularly so in the case of indoor exposure to radon and its decay products which accounts for over 30 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total radiation. </p>
 <p> <#> Radon is a natural radioactive gas that has no taste, smell or colour and requires special equipment to detect its presence. <#> It is part of the decay chain of uranium, which is widely dispersed in the earths crust, and its best known decay product, radium, which is the immediate precursor of radon. <#> Most soil and rock have traces of radon but the amount can vary in different parts of the country and at different times of the year. <#> Being a gas, it can move through porous media such as fractured rock and soil and some is exhaled at the surface. <#> When this occurs in the outdoor air it is dispersed in the atmosphere and diluted to low and harmless concentrations. <#> However, once it percolates into a enclosed space such as a building it can accumulate to dangerous levels because dispersion is restricted by the limited ventilation. <#> The concentration will depend on the radon levels in the soil gas, the construction details of the building and the available ventilation. <#> Radon may also be introduced indoors in ground water supplied from a well, or from building materials containing traces of radium, but normally the amounts from these sources are not of any consequence in this country. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 3. Entry Routes </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The increase in indoor levels of radon in recent decades is due most likely to the search for ""tighter"" building enclosures in order to reduce energy consumption. </p>
 <p> <#> These levels depend mainly on the concentration of the sub-floor soil gas and the available entry points in the ground floor area of the building. <#> As these factors usually vary from building to building each case must be considered separately. <#> The more fragmented and porous the underlying rock and soil the greater the amount of radon gas that can rise to the surface. <#> This gas can enter a building in a convective flow through cracks and holes in the floor area and any gaps around service pipes and cables (Figure 1). <#> It is usually pressure-driven due to the slightly lower indoor air pressure compared with that under the floor, a result of wind and temperature difference. <#> As might be expected, elevated levels of radon resulting from soil gas are found mainly in basements and at ground floor levels. <#> Also, radon gas is nine times heavier than air, and therefore tends to remain close to the ground. <#> Radon is not normally a problem in high rise buildings and if an elevated level is found it is likely to have been caused by emission from the building materials used. </p>
 <&> picture </&>
 <h> <bold> <#> 4. Lung Cancer </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The reason for concern about radon is its association with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. <#> Radon being radioactive disintegrates and gives off decay products known as daughters or progeny which are also radioactive. <#> These are minute particles which when released in the air may be inhaled and deposited in the lungs. <#> As they in turn decay they give a radiation dose to the lung tissues which may eventually cause lung cancer. <#> The risk is related to the level and length of exposure and is normally considered as a lifetime risk. <#> While few people these days spend a lifetime in the same house it would be foolish to ignore the risk completely and for some, the predictions over a lifetime are likely to be significant. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 5. Occurrence in Ireland </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Radioactivity in air resulting from radon is measured in becquerel per cubic metre (Bq/m3). <#> This unit of measurement means that radon is present at a concentration that emits one particle of radiation per second in a cubic metre of air. <#> A survey carried out by Dr. J.P. McLaughlin of University College Dublin of a random sample of approximately 1300 houses in the State shows a median level of indoor radon of about 35 Bq/m3 throughout the country. </p>
 <p> <#> <*> asterisk </*> The Editor wishes to apologise sincerely to Mr Connell for allowing the gremlins to wreak havoc with his excellent article when first published in the August/September issue. </p>
 <p> <#> However, levels in excess of 400 Bq/m3 were found in 1.5 <*> per cent sign </*> of cases with individual peaks rising as high as 1700 Bq/m3. <#> Most of these were located in parts of counties Clare, Galway, Mayo and Cork, but even in these counties the vast majority of the sample houses had a low radon level. <#> A more recent survey of over 500 houses in some western countries was carried out by the Nuclear Energy Board and U.C.D. to identify the distribution of elevated concentration in these areas. <#> The results indicate that about 2.8 <*> per cent sign </*> had radon levels above 400 Bq/m3 and that 9.4 <*> per cent sign </*> were above 200 Bq/m3. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 6. Reference Level </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Having a screening measurement carried out is the only way of knowing if a house has a radon problem. <#> A recommended Reference Level for Ireland has been set by the Government at 200 Bq/m3 for the annual average radon gas concentration in an existing home. <#> Above this level action should be taken to reduce it. <#> The level of 200 Bq/m3 is also intended to apply to all future houses which ideally should be constructed so that radon concentrations are as low as reasonably practicable and be at least below this level. <#> In existing houses, for levels up to 500 Bq/m3 it would be desirable to take action within a few years and where levels are over 1000 Bq/m3, within a year or so. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 7. Risks </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> For most people, the risk of developing lung cancer from radon is insignificant compared with other everyday risks. <#> Nevertheless, despite the lack of complete agreement among experts on the precise risk, it has been calculated that exposure to the Reference Level of an annual average of 200 Bq/m3 corresponds to a lifetime risk of lung cancer of about 2.5 <*> per cent sign </*>. <#> The normal lifetime risk of contracting lung cancer in Ireland is about 3 <*> per cent sign </*>. </p>
 <p> <#> International estimates now suggest that between 5 <*> per cent sign </*> and 10 <*> per cent sign </*> of lung cancer deaths may be caused by indoor radon exposure. <#> There is also strong evidence which indicates a much higher risk from radon for cigarette smokers <}> <-> that </-> <+> than </+> </}> for non-smokers. <#> The National Radiological Protection Board in the U.K. in a 1990 publication puts this risk at 10 times that for non-smokers at all levels of exposure. <#> This arises from a synergistic or multiplicative interaction of both carcinogens, which means that the combined effect exceeds the sum of the two effects taken independently. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 8. Methods of Detection </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The two most common devices used for measuring indoor radon concentrations are the alpha track detector and the charcoal canister. <#> The charcoal canister is a small container of activated carbon which absorbs radon. <#> It is exposed in a living area for about a week and then sent to a laboratory for analysis. <#> The alpha track gives a more accurate reading of the average exposure but must be left in place for a longer period, usually three months, to cover the widely fluctuating daily and seasonal variations. <#> The detector consists of a small container which allows the alpha particles released by the radon to come in contact inside the container with a small piece of special plastic in which tracks are formed by the radiation striking it. <#> After exposure for the recommended time it is also sent to a laboratory for analysis. <#> The <}> <-> intial </-> <+> initial </+> </}> screening measurement may indicate that there is no need for further action, but in some cases it may be necessary to take measurements over a longer period to get a more accurate estimate of the average level. <#> There are other techniques requiring operation by trained personnel which can be used to give ""instant"" reading, but they are more expensive and, due to the normal variation in concentrations over a short period of time, would be certainly less reliable in determining the average radon level. </p>
 <p> <#> It is possible to take radon measurements in the ground on a prospective building site, but the results may be of limited value. <#> Alfa track detectors may be buried in holes about 600mm deep and recovered after exposure for one week. <#> If high readings are found there is no doubt about the need for preventative measures. <#> Low readings in the ground, however, may not be taken as a guarantee of low concentrations inside a future building on the site, as any excavation necessary during construction may increase the release of soil gas which could result in high indoor concentrations. <#> After construction it would probably be necessary to have indoor measurements taken in both cases to find out the actual level inside the building. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 9. Prediction of Concentration </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> One of the difficulties at present with the occurrence of radon gas is that no reliable method has been found for identifying the geographical areas most at risk. <#> There is evidence linking high radon levels with underlying areas of uranium-bearing granite, shales, phosphate and certain sandstones, but this pattern is not entirely reliable which makes it difficult to prepare maps predicting areas of high concentrations based on geographical data. <#> As an alternative, national surveys based on map grids are extremely expensive and lengthy exercises and result in only very general indications due to the variations in radon concentrations that may occur within small areas. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION <*> ampersand </*> COMPENSATION COMMITTEE TO THE BOARD </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Throughout the year, Irish Permanent plc had procedures in place which met with the Best Practice Provisions as set out in Sections A and B of the Irish Stock Exchange 's Listing Rules requirements on Directors ' remuneration. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Remuneration <*> ampersand </*> Compensation Committee </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The Remuneration and Compensation Committee comprises John Bourke (Chairman), Eileen Lemass and Patrick O'Neill, all of whom are non-Executive Directors. <#> The Committee is responsible for the formulation of the Group 's policy on senior executive remuneration. <#> It considers and determines salaries and other terms of remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior executives. <#> The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Board of Directors meeting with the Chairman in absentia. <#> The Committee meets about four times a year, although more frequent meetings may be held if required. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Remuneration Policy </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The Group 's policy on senior executive remuneration is to reward its executives competitively, having regard to the comparative marketplace in Ireland and the United Kingdom, in order to ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the best interest of the shareholders. <#> Advice is sought by the Committee from external consultants. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Non-Executive Directors </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Non-Executive Directors are remunerated by way of Directors ' fees only, full details of which are disclosed in note 37 on page 47 of the financial statements. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Executive Directors ' Remuneration </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are basic salary and benefits, short-term performance bonuses, pensions, participation in the Share Option Scheme, participation in the Long-term Cash Bonus Scheme and the provision of mortgage loans. <#> Each of these elements is discussed below and full details of the Executive Directors ' remuneration is set out in note 37 on page 47 of the financial statements. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Salary <*> ampersand </*> Benefits </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The basic salary of Executive Directors is reviewed annually having regard to competitive market practice. <#> Employment-related benefits primarily comprise a company car. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Short-term Performance Bonus </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Short-term performance bonus awards in any year are determined by the Committee by reference to criteria which are set by the Committee and by reference to the overall profit performance of the Group. <#> The awards range from 0 per cent to a maximum of 50 per cent of basic salary in any one financial year. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Pensions </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Executive Directors participate in a group defined benefit pension scheme. <#> Pension benefits are determined solely in relation to basic salary. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Share Option Scheme </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Executive Directors, in common with other senior executives, participate in the Share Option Scheme which was adopted on 21 September 1994. <#> Under the Scheme, the Committee is entitled to select executives to participate in the Scheme. <#> The terms of the Scheme provide that options shall be exercisable at the higher of the market value per share on the day preceding the date of grant of the option or its nominal value. <#> The aggregate exercise price of options quoted under the Scheme may not exceed four times an executive 's emoluments. <#> Shares representing not more than five per cent of the shares for the time being in issue may be issued under the Scheme. <#> Options may only be exercised if the Group meets certain earnings per share targets based upon growth in earnings per share over a three year period following the grant of any option. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Long-term Cash Bonus Scheme </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Prior to Conversion, the Group operated a Long-term Cash Bonus Scheme ('The Scheme') which was terminated on 30 June 1994 and was then replaced by the Share Option Scheme. <#> The participants in the Scheme are eight senior members of management, including the three Executive Directors. <#> Payment will be made in 1997 of IR <*> pound sign </*> 2.02 million (being IR <*> pound sign </*> 1,633 million plus interest accrued thereon). <#> This is in accordance with the decision of the Board made in 1994, on the basis of expert external advice, which determined the amount which was due under the Scheme. <#> Payment was conditional upon the Group meeting pre-determined performance criteria for the five financial years 1992 to 1996 which have now been achieved. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Mortgage Loans to Directors </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Any mortgage loan to an Executive Director of Irish Permanent plc up to IR <*> pound sign </*> 50,000 is charged at 4 <*> per cent sign </*> which is the reduced rate of interest applicable to mortgage loans to Irish Permanent staff. <#> Where applicable, the balance of any mortgage loan in excess of IR <*> pound sign </*> 50,000 to an Executive Director is subject to Irish Permanent 's normal terms and conditions for borrowers. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Directors ' Service Contracts </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The Executive Directors operate under service contracts which may be terminated by the provision of two years ' notice by either party which is in accordance with the normal practice of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS ' RESPONSIBILITIES </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. <#> In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: <#> select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; <#> make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; <#> prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business. </p>
 <p> <#> The Directors are responsible for keeping proper books of account which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, and all Regulations to be construed as one with those Acts. <#> They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> REPORT BY THE AUDITORS TO IRISH PERMANENT plc ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In addition to our audit of the financial statements, we have reviewed the Directors ' statements, on pages 10 and 11 on the Company 's compliance with the paragraphs of the Code of Best Practice specified for our review by the Irish Stock Exchange and their adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. <#> The objective of our review is to draw attention to non compliance with Listing Rules 12.43 (j) and 12.43 (v). </p>
 <p> <#> We carried out our review in accordance with guidance issued by the Auditing Practices Board. <#> The guidance does not require us to perform the additional work necessary to, and we do not, express any opinion on the effectiveness of either the Company 's system of internal financial control or its corporate governance procedures nor on the ability of the Company to continue in operational existence. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Opinion: </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> With respect to the Directors ' statements on internal control on pages 10 and 11, and going concern on page 11, in our opinion the Directors have provided the disclosures required by the Listing Rule referred to above and such statements are not inconsistent with the information of which we are aware from our audit work on the financial statements. </p>
 <p> <#> Based on enquiry of certain Directors and officers of the Company, and examination of relevant documents, in our opinion the Directors ' statements on pages 10 and 11 appropriately reflect the Company 's compliance with the other paragraphs of the Code specified for our review by Listing Rule 12.43 (j). </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> AUDITORS ' REPORT </bold> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> To the membership of Irish Permanent plc </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> We have audited the financial statements on pages 20 to 49. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors in relation to the financial statements: </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> As described on page 17 the Company 's Directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements. <#> It is our responsibility to form an independent opinion, based on our audit, of those statements and to report our opinion to you. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Basis of opinion: </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. <#> An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. <#> It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group 's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. </p>
 <p> <#> We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. <#> In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Opinion: </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 December 1996 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990 and all Regulations to be construed as one with those Acts. </p>
 <p> <#> We have obtained all the information and explanations we considered necessary for the purposes of our audit. <#> In our opinion, proper books of account have been kept by the Company. <#> The balance sheet of the Company at 31 December 1996 is in agreement with the books of account. </p>
 <p> <#> In our opinion, the information given in the Directors ' Report on pages 9 to 14 is consistent with the financial statements. </p>
 <p> <#> The net assets of the Company as stated in the balance sheet on page 21 are more than half of its called up share capital and, in our opinion, on that basis there did not exist at 31 December 1996 a financial situation which, under section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983, would require the convening of an extraordinary general meeting of the Company. </p>

 <p> <#> In order to reflect the different nature of the Group 's and policyholders ' interests in the long-term assurance assets, the value of the long-term assurance assets attributable to the Group and the value of the long-term assets and liabilities attributable to policyholders are classified under separate headings in the consolidated balance sheet. </p>
 <p> <#> The amount shown as long-term assurance assets attributable to shareholders is determined based on a prudent assessment of the embedded value. <#> The embedded value is the present value of statutory earnings expected to emerge in the future from policies currently in force, together with the net tangible assets of the business. <#> In determining this value, assumptions regarding future mortality rates, lapse rates, surrender rates, investment returns, solvency margins and levels of expenses are made based on the experience of the business. <#> This value is determined on the advice of independent qualified actuaries and is included separately in the consolidated balance sheet. </p>
 <p> <#> Movements in the value of the Group 's long-term assurance assets attributable to shareholders, grossed up for taxation at the standard corporation tax rate, are included as other operating income in the consolidated profit and loss account. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Complexity of Adaptation in Real-World Case-Based Reasoning Systems </bold> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> 1 Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a reasoning method that uses experiential knowledge, in the form of cases, to solve problems. <#> When faced with a new problem a CBR system will retrieve a case that is similar, and, if necessary, adapt it to provide the desired solution. <#> Its current popularity as a problem solving paradigm is representative of the shift that has occurred in automated problem solving research; researchers are beginning to move from simple, ""toy"" domains to complex, real world domains. <#> With this move has come a recognition of the many inadequacies of traditional problem solving approaches, and assumptions previously deemed reasonable have proved invalid in complex, dynamic real world domains. <#> Case-based reasoning methods have proved useful in dealing with many of these problems and have had considerable initial success in real world problem solving endeavours.</p>
 <p> <#> Researchers have organised problem solving into three main classes. <#> In order of increasing complexity, these are: <it> simple, routine, </it> and <it> innovative </it>. <#> Simple problem solving activities are characterised by domains whose simplicity facilitate solution generation in a fairly straightforward fashion; there is a relatively direct inference path from problem specification to problem solution. <#> With routine problem solving, domains are more complex and often incomplete, problem specifications are conceptually quite distant from their solutions, and additional computational expense is incurred due to conflicts between dependent domain objects. <#> The most difficult activity, innovative problem solving, is identified by patchy domain models, intricate solution paths through the problem-space, and a considerable amount of backtracking due to interaction problems. </p>
 <p> <#> The aim of this paper is to characterise the relationship between case-based reasoning and problem solving tasks of differing complexity. <#> This relationship is discussed in detail in the next sections. <#> Sections three, four and five solidify this discussion by introducing three real CBR systems concerned with simple, routine, and innovative problem solving. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 2 Problem Solving Complexity and CBR </bold> <h>
 <p> <#> Our perspective on problem solving is concerned with search-based problem solving techniques. <#> Such problem solvers search a space of ""world models"" or ""problem states"" (the problem-space) to find one in which all the problem goals have been achieved (the goal state). <#> Search proceeds through the problem-space by the application of state-transforming operators. <#> The task of the problem solver is then to find some sequence of operators that transform the initial state into the goal state. <#> The complexity and cost of automated problem solving is well studied and there are many ways that it can be estimated. <#> The classic measure is the amount of search which has to be carried out in developing a solution to a problem. </p>
 <p> <#> Essentially, there are two search related problems associated with conventional problem solving methods. <#> The first, which we term the <it> operator chaining problem </it> <sp> 1 </sp>, is basically the problem of searching forward through the problem-space to find the appropriate sequence (chain) of operators with which to solve the target problem. <#> Relieving this problem has been (and still is) the objective of much research and has resulted in a range of relatively successful techniques (e.g. heuristic search, hierarchical planning, least commitment strategy, goal regression etc. ). <#> Further computational complexity arises from the <it> operator conflict problem </it> <sp> 2 </sp>. <#> As a planner interacts with its domain it receives a stream of conjunctive goals. <#> Were these goals independent of one another the cost of problem solving would be linear with the number of goals. <#> The reality is somewhat different. <#> Operator conflicts can result in unfavourable interactions between goals. <#> Under such conditions the problem solver must backtrack over earlier work in order to plan a new solution which avoids these interactions. <#> If somehow the problem solver could learn specific sequences of actions that overcome interaction problems in certain situations, the cost per goal could be reduced in the long run. </p>
 <p> <#> Case-based reasoning methods attempt to address both of these problems. <#> By constraining the problem-space search, it reduces the operator chaining problem; the retrieval of a similar case constitutes a considerable 'jump' into the problem space thereby eliminating many potential routes from the search. <#> Furthermore, CBR is potentially a more efficient constraint method than conventional approaches (e.g. heuristic evaluation etc.) whose scope is more local, pertaining to individual problem space states rather than whole areas. <#> Backtracking due to bad interactions may also be avoided, thereby relieving the operator conflict problem. <#> Effectively, cases can be viewed as 'canned' solutions where operator conflicts have been resolved in certain well defined situations As long as the retrieved case is sufficiently similar to the target relatively few conflicts should arise due to modifications made during adaptation. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> An Overview of CBR </bold> </h> <p> <#> In CBR, problem solving knowledge is characterised as a set of episodes each representing the solution to a specific problem situation. <#> A new problem (the <it> target </it>) is solved by retrieving a similar episode (<it> base case </it>) from memory, and its solution is then modified to conform with the target situation. <#> Cases are represented by features and relationships and case retrieval depends on matching these case representations. <#> It can be seen from the following description of the stages in CBR that the retrieval stages is a two stage process:- </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Representation:</bold> </h>: <#> Cases are represented by features and operators (relationships). <#> The features may be surface or abstract features and typically the more predictive features will be selected for indexing. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Base Filtering </bold> </h> : <#> A small number of candidate episodes which are considered contextually similar to the target situation are selected from the case base. <#> The case base will often be organised as a discrimination network (D-net) to facilitate this. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Case Selection / Mapping </bold> </h>: <#> This second stage will select a case from this candidate set based on a more detailed comparison of the cases. <#> A mapping between the base and target cases may also be produced at this stage. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Adaptation </bold> </h> : <#> Once the best case from the case base has been selected it must be adapted to fit the problem in hand. <#> In the simplest situations, for instance diagnosis, this adaptation may be trivial and the base case may apply without modification. <#> Adaptation may be very complex in more difficult problem domains, e.g. non routine design. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> 2.2 A CBR Perspective on Complexity </bold> </h> <#> Earlier we introduced the notion of a number of types of problem solving: simple, routine, and innovative. <#> In fact, we can view these as a continuum of problem solving tasks (Figure 1) organised in terms of computational complexity. <#> As illustrated, the relative contribution of the operator chaining and operator conflict problems varies across this continuum. <#> Due to the simplicity of their domains, simple problem solving tasks incur the bulk of their cost from the operator chaining problem; the lack of domain complexity leads to few conflicts so little time is spent backtracking. <#> At the other end of the continuum, the complexity of the domains of innovative problem solving tasks results in the operator conflict problem being very prominent (and expensive to resolve), with proportionately less time spent on the operator chaining problem. </p>
 <%> Figure 1 </%>
 <p> <#> The basic tenet of CBR is that, rather than solve a problem from first principles, it may be easier to retrieve a similar problem and transform the solution to that problem. <#> In Figure 2 we attempt to illustrate these trade-offs graphically. <#> SP' represents the specification for a new problem and SL' is the solution to that problem. <#> FP' represents the search process that establishes this solution from first principles - the task we wish to avoid. <#> A CBR solution is worthwhile if the retrieval task R, and the adaptation task A are simpler than FP'.</p>
 <&> Figure 2 </&>
 <p> <#> In the later sections of this paper we will examine three CBR systems that differ in the complexity of the transformation task A:- </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Substitution Adaptation: </bold> </h> : <#> This is the simplest type of adaptation and merely involved substituting some of the parameters in the solution. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> Transformational Adaptation: </bold> </h> : <#> This adaptation is more complex and will involve structural changes to the solution.</p>
 <p> <h> <bold> Generative Adaptation: </bold> </h>: <#> This is the most complex adaptation and is not perfectly represented by the diagram. <#> The adaptation process involves a rework of the reasoning process FP in the context of the new problem situation represented by SP'.</p>
 <p> <#> From a case-based reasoning perspective there is a relationship between the complexity of the problem solving task and the complexity of the CBR adaptation process. <#> CBR systems concerned with simple problem solving tasks will typically require simple, substitutional adaptation; the retrieved case will typically be very close to the target and consequently will require only very basic substitutive adaptation, with little or no chance of bad interactions occurring. <#> With routine problem solving tasks, the retrieved case, while being similar to the target, will probably require substantial modification possibly changing some structural elements of the retrieved solution (transformational adaptation), and innovative problem solving tasks extensive modifications are necessary during adaptation so interactions are unavoidable and difficult to resolve. <#> To accommodate this adaptation complexity it is generally necessary to augment cases with detailed knowledge such as the reasoning trace structures of Carbonell 's Derivational Analogy. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 3 Rachman: Substitutional Adaptation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Simple problem solving tasks are characterised by well-defined domain models, and a relatively direct inference path from problem specification to problem solution. <#> Case-based reasoning methods are particularly well suited to such tasks as there is often a rich set of cases to draw upon during problem solving. <#> The retrieved case is typically very similar to the target problem and consequently the adaptation problem is relatively uncomplicated; in general modifying the attributes of solution elements will suffice without the need to change the overall solution structure. </p>
 <&> Figure 3 </&>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> 3.1 A Brief Overview of Rachman </bold> </h> <#> Figure 3 shows two example cases from a case-based system called Rachman that can predict the selling value of a house given some details about it. <#> The system contains a large case base of houses and their selling prices and, given a house description, it will retrieve a case or a set of cases describing similar houses and their selling prices. <#> These prices can be adjusted depending on differences between the target and base cases to estimate the price of the target house. <#> This system is comparatively straightforward but is equivalent to a host of potential CBR applications, for example loan risk assessment and help-desk assistants. <#> The complexity of this problem is greatly reduced by having a well populated case base, so that good matches can be found and the required adaptation is not difficult.</p>
 <p> <#> The cases are divided into two sets of features, the index features and the internal features. <#> The index features are the most strongly predictive features and form the basis for the D-Net (Figure 4). <#> The main problem with the D-Net approach is that it forces a strict ordering of the index features, in this example the cases might be organised first under location, then number of bedrooms, etc. <#> However, different users may have different priorities; some, for instance, might consider the number of bedrooms to be more important than location. <#> In addition, it will not be possible to retrieve matches for cases that have missing features as the retrieval process will not be able to search below the level of that feature in the network.</p>
 <p> <#> These problems are largely solved by introducing redundancy into the D-Net. <#> This means that the network supports alternative orderings on the index features (see Figure 4). <#> The extent to which redundancy can be introduced into the network is limited because the size of the network grows in proportion to the number of orderings supported. <#> Retrieval in Rachman returns clusters of cases and the cases are ranked according to their frequency of occurrence in these clusters. </p>
 <&> Figure 4 </&>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> 3.2 Substitutional Adaptation in Rachman </bold> </h> <#> It is assumed with this system that the case base is well populated so that near or exact matches can be found. <#> This means that the adaptation is comparatively straightforward using substitution specialists that adjust the price based on differences between the base and target cases. <#> For instance a substitution specialist may add or remove the value of having a conservatory. <#> The important point is that the effect of this adjustment is quite local and does not cause complex interactions.</p>
 <h> <bold> <#> D&/ej&\a Vu: Transformational Adaptation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In a CBR system for routine problem solving, retrieved cases, while being comparatively similar to the target, will probably require substantial structural modification. <#> Consequently a limited opportunity exists for bad interactions to occur. <#> Carbonell (Carbonell, 1983) characterises such problem solvers as belonging to the realm of <it> <}> <-> Tranformational </-> <+> Transformational </+> </}> Analogy </it>. <#> Essentially, the adaptation stage can be considered as a solution transformation problem. <#> Finding the appropriate transformation is itself a problem-solving process, but in a different problem space. <#> The states of this transformation-space (T-space) are problem solutions, as opposed to solution states. <#> The transformation-space operators (T-operators) are atomic solution transformation operators (e.g., Substitute Solution Step, Delete Solution Step, Insert Solution Step, Reorder Solution Steps). <#> And the job of adaptation is to find the appropriate sequence of T-operators which will transform the retrieved solution into the desired target solution (See Figure 5). </p>

 <h> <#> THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE MUSEUM ARTIFACTS </h>
 <p> <#> As many of you may already know, we are computerising the artifacts and archives of the museum. <#> As there is limited storage space on the premises, it was decided that it would be impractical to hold paper records. <#> Therefore all data is being stored on the computer 's hard disk and is backed up on floppy disks. </p>
 <p> <#> Thanks to the Co-Ordinator of the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot FAS project, Brendan Teeling, we have a Data Base III plus programme which has been customised for our particular purposes. </p>
 <p> <#> Due to having some past experience, the computing has become a major element of my work at the museum. <#> Currently we are inputting entries for each item in the Synagogue section of the museum, a task which is nearing completion. <#> The speed at which we are progressing is entirely due to the ""user friendly"" nature of the DBase programme. </p>
 <p> <#> When all the records have been stored in the computer 's memory, it will be necessary to devise a programme which allows the information to be readily accessible to anyone wishing to use it. <#> This will involve the creation of standard ""search headings"". <#> By this I mean that all information relating to common topics will be stored under the same heading. <#> This will ensure that the data will be in the most accessible form possible. </p>
 <p> <#> In the long term, the records will be available for the purpose of serious research, and above all there will be a working catalogue of the contents of the museum available to all. <#> This will help to ensure that a permanent record of the Irish Jewish Community will be retained for future generations. </p>

 <h> <quote> <#> There are not facts, only interpretations. </quote>
 <#> <it> Friedrich Neitzsche </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Object recognition is the process of identifying material things by associating what is sensed with what is known. <#> A wide diversity of approaches have been taken to object recognition; however, <quote> <it> ""there is no existing system that comes close to solving the general object recognition problem""[11]. </it> </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> This chapter presents a new method of addressing the problem of three-dimensional object recognition of rigid objects on the basis of comparisons between <it> viewed </it> three-dimensional models (i.e. which are extracted from imaged data at runtime) and <it> known </it> object models (which are generated using Computer Aided Design data) <sp> 1 </sp/>. <#> It addresses the problem in terms of sub-problems (i.e. the determination of orientation and the determination of position), as Ikeuchi does in [10], and provides a framework for comparing the object models using several different secondary representations of the models (which may be regarded, in the complex of the framework described, as forms of complex scalar transform descriptors). </p>
 <p> <#> This technique overcomes the dependency of comparing models on the basis of primitive components (such as individual edges, vertices or surfaces), and provides a measure for evaluating the reliability of any determined match on the basis of a comparison of complete views of the models. <#> The approach has been tested with theoretical models and models extracted from range data and is shown to work well as long as the models extracted are reasonably accurate. </p>
 <p> <#> The model comparisons are performed indirectly using several different secondary representations which are derived from the models. <#> Hence, as models are matched implicitly, rather than explicitly (using model components), the method developed herein has been dubbed <quote> 'implicit model matching'.</quote> </p>
 <p> <#> When considering any object recognition strategy, it is necessary to address eight main issues: <#> 1. The domain of objects to be recognised. <#> 2. The allowed complexity of the scenes. <#> 3. The representations to be used for both the <it> viewed </it>, and the <it> known </it> objects. <#> 4 The method(s) of obtaining the <it> known </it> object representations. <#> 5 The method(s) of obtaining the <it> viewed </it> object representations. <#> 6 The model invocation strategy (i.e. which <it> known </it> objects to consider for matching). <#> 7 The model matching strategy. <#> 8 The method of hypothesis verification. <#> Each of these issues is considered in turn in the sections which follow. </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> 9.1 Object Domain and Scene Complexity. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The problem being addressed is that of the automatic recognition of three-dimensional non-articulate <sp> 2 </sp> rigid objects. <#> In this context, the problem is equated to the matching of a view of a solitary <sp> 3 </sp> 3-D object model (the <it> viewed </it> model) with <it> known </it> object models in order to recognise the view of the observed object model. <#> Recognition is taken to imply determination of the position and orientation of a <it> known </it> object model which best <}> <-> matchs </-> <+> matches </+> </}> the <it> viewed </it> model (along with an associated <}> <-> a </-> </}> measure of its reliability). </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> 9.2 Methods or representing and obtaining object models. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The issue of representation has already been addressed in chapter 8, but a brief summary is <}> <+> in </+> </}> order. <#> There are two distinct classes of object representation used: <#> 1. The first class of representation details 3-D objects so that they may be symbolically manipulated and considered from any viewpoint. <#> The representation used here is a simple planar-surface based model similar to that of Roberts[13]. <#> However, it should be noted that the recognition strategy employed is independent of the type of representation used to detail the objects.
 <#> 2. The second class of representation is derived from the first and, hence, the various different representations used from this class may be regarded as secondary representations of the detailed object models. <#> They may also be regarded as complex scalar transform descriptors, as each representation is composed of a fixed-size array of scalars. <#> These representations depend only on certain object parameters (e.g. orientation) and are used to guide the recognition system efficiently through the potentially exhaustive search for the correct position and orientation of the correct model. </p>
 <p> <#> The four secondary representations which are used include: <#> 1 Extended Gaussian Images. <#> 2 Directional Histograms. <#> 3 Needle Diagrams. <#> 4 Depth Maps. </p>
 <p> <#> Detailed <it> known </it> object models are specified using a CAD specification technique and detailed <it> viewed </it> models are derived from range images. <#> Both of these methods (and all of the representations) are described in the previous chapter. </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> 9.3 Model invocation. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Model invocation is the selection of <it> known </it> models with which to attempt matching. <#> However, with the approach presented in this chapter, matching is performed between views of object models. <#> Hence, rather than just invoke object models, it is necessary to invoke approximate <sp> 4 </sp> views of models. <#> This inherently addresses model invocation (in the strict sense of the term); if no view of a particular model is invoked, then the model itself is not invoked. </p>
 <p> <#> Model view invocation is performed by determining the possible orientations from which each <it> known </it> model could be viewed in order to result in a view similar <}> <+> to </+> </}> the <it> viewed </it> model. <#> The focal axis of the camera with respect to the <it> known </it> model 's frame of reference is first determined, and subsequently possible values for the roll of the camera with respect to its own frame of reference (i.e. around the focal axis) are calculated; see figure 9.1. </p>
 <&> figure </&>>
 <p> <#> It was noted above that the task of model invocation is to determine orientations from which each <it> known </it> model could be viewed, so that the resultant view might be similar to that of the <it> viewed </it> model. <#> This is an important point, as it is indicative of the fact that, rather than compute transformations which theoretically map <it> known </it> models to the same 3-D space as the <it> viewed </it> model, the task of model invocation and model matching in this method is to determine potential orientations from which to view the <it> known </it> models, with respect to the individual <it> known </it> models frames of reference (much as Goad does in [8]). </p>
 <p> <#> The <it> viewed </it> model should have a camera model of some sort associated with it (i.e. that which <}> <-> which </-> </}> represents the original viewing device). <#> The camera model used with <it> known </it> models is similar, in that it uses the same internal parameters, although it is defined with respect to a different coordinate frame (i.e. that of the <it> known </it> object model). </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> 9.3.1 Determining potential orientations of the focal axis. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In order to determine potential orientations of the camera with respect to a <it> known </it> model 's frame of reference, a sample of all possible orientations is used. <#> This sampling of orientation space is defined by the tesselations of a Gaussian sphere. </p>
 <p> <#> Using each of the directions associated with the sphere tesselations as possible orientations of the camera focal axis, directional histograms of the tilts visable from the <it> known </it> model are determined. These directional histograms are compared with a directional histogram of tilt determined from the <it> viewed </it> model, resulting in a degree-of-fit for each possible orientation. <#> A degree-of-fit is calculated using normalised cross correlation for each invocation and gives a measure of likelihood that the model is at an orientation within the range defined by the relevant sphere <}> <-> tessalation </-> <+> tesselation </+> </}> <sp> 5 </sp> is that which must be recognised. <#> The orientations which possibly correspond to a match are defined by those <}> <-> tessalations </-> <+> tesselations </+> </}> of the sphere which exhibit local maximum values for the degree-of-fit of tilt (as they change slowly from <}> <-> tessalation </-> <+> tessalation </+> </}> to <}> <-> tessalation </-> <+> tesselations </+> </}>) <sp> 6 </sp> and the likelihood is defined by the degree-of-fit. </p>
 <p> <#> An example of the comparison of tilts from each possible orientation is shown in Figure 9.2. The <it> known </it> model is considered from all possible viewpoints as defined by each tesselation of sphere, and each tesselation of the sphere is shown encoding the degree-of-fit determined through the comparison of tilt histograms. </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> 9.3.2 Determining possible values of roll. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Having determined potential orientations for the camera focal axis, potential values for roll, around that focal axis, must be calculated. <#> This is accomplished by comparing (using normalised cross correlation) the directional histogram of roll defined by the <it> viewed </it> model with that derived from the <it> known </it> model in an arbitrary roll, as viewed using the previously determined focal axis. <#> The comparison is performed at all possible values <sp> 7 </sp> of roll (of the theoretical model), simply rotating <sp> 8 </sp> the roll histogram of the theoretical model in order to define each possible roll. <#> Smoothing of the histograms before comparison again provides a smoothly changing degree-of-fit, and once again the local maxima define the potential matches. <#> An example of the comparison of roll histograms is given in Figure 9.3. </p>
 <p> <#> The result of this operation is the determination of viewing orientation frames of reference, defined with respect to <it> known </it> models frames of reference, which may provide views of those <it> known </it> models which are similar to the viewed model. </p>
 <&> figures </&>
 <h> <#> <bold> 9.4 Model matching strategy. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Model invocation, in this method, supplies potential orientation frames of reference for <it> known </it> models. <#> These, however, are only approximations as the orientation space is quite coarsely sampled. <#> One task of model matching is, then, to fine tune these orientation frames and to determine the position of the viewing camera relative to the <it> known </it> model. </p>
 <p> <#> Model matching consists of a number of steps, during which the orientation frames will either be accepted (and their updated versions passed to the model verification stage) or rejected. <#> These steps are: <#> 1 Determination of approximate object position. <#> 2 Fine tuning of object orientation. <#> 3 Fine tuning of viewed object position. <#> 4 Fine tuning of object depth. <#> 5 Fine tuning of viewed object position to sub-pixel accuracy. <#> Each of these steps is discussed in turn. </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> 9.4.1 Determining approximate object position. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In order to allow the position of the object to be fine tuned (and in order to allow the object to be viewed during tuning operations in general), the position of the camera with respect to the <it> known </it> model must be estimated. <#> To do this, the position of the <it> viewed </it> model with respect to its viewing camera is used (refer to figure 9.4). <#> The imaged centroid of the viewed model and an approximate measure of the distance of the <it> viewed </it> model from the viewing camera are both very easily computed. <#> The position of the camera which views the <it> known </it> model is then approximated by placing the camera in a position relative to the <it> known </it> model 's 3-D centroid, such that the centroid is at the correct approximate distance from the camera (as determined from the <it> viewed </it> model), and is imaged by the camera in the same position as the <it> viewed </it> model 's imaged centroid. </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> 9.4.2 Fine tuning object orientation. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Fine tuning object orientation is performed in a similar way to the approximate determination of object roll. <#> Pitch, yaw and roll histograms derived from the theoretical model are compared to those derived from the <it> viewed </it> model. <#> The differences between them indicate the amount by which the orientation may best be fine tuned (e.g. see figure 9.5) <#> This is done within a limited range of angles (the range being defined by the sampling of the sphere which was used for sampling orientation space during the model invocation stage), and at reasonably high angular resolutions (i.e. 1/4 <sp> <*> degrees sign </*> </sp>), in order to ensure accurate tuning. </p>
 <p> <#> Additionally it should be pointed out that the individual fine tuning operations affect not only the current directional histogram (e.g. roll), but also, in a small way the other directional histograms (e.g. pitch, yaw). <#> Hence the fine tuning is performed by calculating a specific directional histogram, tuning the relevant component of orientation, and then moving on to the next directional histogram. <#> This is done until the amount of tuning for all components of orientation falls below the required accuracy, or until the total tuning on any of the orientations exceeds the range allowed (in which case the invoked model view is rejected). </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> 9.4.2 Fine tuning viewed object position. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Fine tuning of the viewed object position may be formally defined as tuning of the relative position of the viewing camera with respect to the <it> known </it> models reference frame, by translation in the plane which is orthogonal to the focal axis of the camera (i.e. in the directions parallel to the image plane). </p>

 <h> <#> I. INTRODUCTION </h>
 <p> <#> The development of sequential computers has been helped by the fact that the underlying hardware has essentially followed the same architectural model, known as the <it> von Neumann model. </it> <#> The improvements in this model were caused primarily by advances in component technology; each improvement led to better performance in each generation of computers based on this model. <#> Thus sequential computers have had a model of computation that formed a relatively stable base for the development of languages and tools. <#> This is one of the main reasons for the widespread use of these tools and languages, however, the same cannot be said in the case of parallel machines. </p>
 <p> <#> Parallelism has always been utilised in component technology but only in the 1970s did it become explicitly available in a machine architecture for the programmer; e.g., the Cray-1. <#> It was not until the 1980s that commercially available parallel machines incorporating a wide variety of architectures were introduced; e.g., AMT distributed array processor, Convex, Alliant, Hypercub, Cray X-MP. </p>
 <p> <#> It was the scientific community that first discovered the limitations of sequential machines in their applications. <#> Applications such as weather forecasting were limited in their usefulness by the lack of sufficient processing power to deliver the results in a realistic time scale. <#> The developments in component technology made it clear that the required increase in speed could never be obtained on sequential machines and that the only solution on offer was that of parallel computing. </p>
 <p> <#> Hence, one of the main promises of parallel processing is that the speed up in the execution of an application would be substantial and that this speed up would increase as the amount of parallelism in the system increases. <#> As a consequence users would be able to attempt to solve larger problems as the machine 's capabilities and functionality increases. </p>
 <p> <#> Such improvements are possible only because of the economics of mass produced VLSI components. <#> The production of such components increasingly favours parallel systems built mainly from cheap processors. <#> Early results of experiments using parallel machines report a price-performance advantage in the range of 10 to 30 times better than traditional machines (Wadsworth, 1988). <#> However, such comparisons usually ignore the cost of software, in particular, the effort involved in programming the parallel machine, which has been shown to be a nontrivial exercise requiring considerable skill and expertise. <#> The developments in parallel software are not so far reaching nor so nearly well understood as the developments in parallel hardware. </p>
 <p> <#> In the case of sequential computers the architectural model, the programming paradigms and the method of constructing algorithms all have a single objective. <#> In the case of parallel computers there is at present no single architectural model to represent parallelism but rather a variety of different parallel architectures. </p>
 <p> <#> The main issue affecting the architectural model is how to organise multiple processors to execute in parallel. <#> One of the first models was that of an array processor - the SIMD model - where multiple processors execute the same instruction but on different data; the processors operate under the control of a single processor, which broadcasts the instructions to be executed. <#> Array processors are particularly suited to problems involving matrices, and some impressive results have been achieved. <#> However, the main criticism of this model is that there is little flexibility in the architecture for problems that could benefit from the execution of different instructions at the same time - the MIMD model. </p>
 <p> <#> The earliest MIMD models were based on the shared memory concept, where all the processors are connected to the same memory. <#> In this scenario the processors can execute different parts of an application concurrently, thus ideally reducing the time to execute the complete program. <#> However, this model can lead to severe memory contention problems as the processors attempt to access the same data. <#> There is some question as to whether this model will scale to larger orders of parallelism. </p>
 <p> <#> A more recent MIMD model is the distributed memory model, where each processor has its own local memory and processors communicate by passing messages. <#> However, there is an overhead cost associated with such communication, which in many instances can be substantial. <#> The amount of overhead is influenced by such factors as the distance between the two processors wishing to communicate and the interconnection topology. <#> The distributed model is scalable to greater orders of parallelism than that currently implemented. </p>
 <p> <#> In the case of parallel software the choice of programming language is no longer confined to a single approach. <#> The main division of these languages is into either imperative or declarative languages. <#> The declarative group can be further divided into logic and functional languages while the imperative group consist of procedural and object-oriented languages. </p>
 <p> <#> All the various languages that have been proposed offer some different way of capitalising on the power of parallel machines. <#> To date it is not clear if any one approach is substantially better than any other as enough experience has not yet been accumulated. <#> In many cases the concepts have not been efficiently implemented on parallel machines. <#> In addition there is a considerable lack of tools to assist in all aspects of parallel programming and debugging. <#> One consideration, which was perhaps not so important with sequential languages, is the ability to prove a program correct. <#> This is becoming increasingly important as parallel machines are applied to more crucial aspects of human applications. <#> However, the criteria for judging a language 's design that were established for sequential languages are still valid; criteria such as readability, simplicity, efficiency and expressiveness. </p>
 <p> <#> The third important aspect of programming parallel systems is the choice of algorithm. <#> Studies have shown that transferring an efficient sequential algorithm to a parallel machine results in an inefficient parallel algorithm. <#> It is now apparent that the design and construction of a new parallel algorithm for a particular application area can produce major performance improvements. </p>
 <p> <#> Hence, in the case of parallel systems there are three important and contributing factors; namely, the architectural model, the programming language and the choice of algorithm. <#> The following sections concentrate on the programming language. </p>
 <h> <#> II. APPROACHES TO PARALLEL PROGRAMMING </h>
 <p> <#> Essentially, three main methods have been used to promote the wider use of parallel processing: <#> (i) <it> Extend an existing sequential language with features to represent parallelism. </it> <#> The advantage of extensions is that existing software can be transferred to a new parallel machine with relative cases. <#> This is possible because programmers are already trained in the base language and can introduce the extensions gradually as they become more familiar with the situation in which they should be used and the effect they produce. <#> However, experience to date has shown that extension languages have been limited to a certain range of hardware and to machines with a small number of processors. <#> Problems have also been reported in the debugging of programs written in such languages, as the interaction of the sequential and the parallel features can give rise to difficulties in detecting errors. <#> A more general problem is that many of these extensions have been developed by different groups using the same language base, which has led to nonstandard variants of the same language being produced, making the production of a standard for such languages difficult. </p>
 <p> (ii) <it> <#> Implicit: use a sequential language but rely on the compiler to detect which parts of the program can be executed in parallel.</it> <#> Most of the work in this area is based on FORTRAN and examines the DO loops of the program to determine if it is possible to spread the iterations of the loop across different processors. </p>
 <p> <#> The advantage of such an approach is that existing sequential programs can be moved relatively inexpensively and quickly to the parallel machine. <#> This can represent a substantial saving in development costs and is an attractive proposition for many purchasers of a new parallel machine. <#> However, it is rare that the full parallelism of the program is exploited without the help of a programmer to restructure the program; this usually requires a reorganisation of the loops of the program so that the automatic detection techniques will work. </p>
 <p> <#> In the case of the construction of new programs it is advisable that a programmer have some knowledge of the detection techniques if as much parallelism as possible is to be detected. <#> This represents a diversion for a programmer from the main task of program construction. <#> In addition, such an approach inhibits the development of parallel languages and algorithms as it is confined to a sequential notation. </p>
 <p> (iii) <it> <#> Develop a new parallel language. </it> In this case a completely new parallel language is developed, ignoring all existing languages and applications. <#> The main advantage of this approach is that a coherent approach to parallelism is presented. <#> The parallel notation will enable a user to express directly the parallelism in an application and, in addition, will assist with the development of new parallel algorithms. <#> However, it does mean that a user will have to rebuild the entire software base in the new language, which is a labour intensive, expensive and perhaps an error prone exercise. <#> All existing applications are ignored, which requires courage on the part of the management of large installations, particularly since many new languages have not had the property of longevity. </p>
 <h> <#> III. IMPLICIT PARALLELISM </h>
 <p> <#> Recent years have demonstrated that parallel processors are now a viable and commercially successful product and that it is the software for these machines which is lagging behind and causing the most difficulties. <#> The highly successful tactic of Cray in the 1970s, of providing a FORTRAN engine, a machine that would take existing FORTRAN programs and detect which parts could be automatically vectorised, is the objective for the newer breed of multiprocessors only now based on parallelism. <#> The origins of many of these systems can be traced to the research of David Kuck at the University of Illinois on vectorisation technique. <#> This research has been extended to incorporate the situation where many processors, possibly vector processors, share the same memory. <#> The model used for most shared memory machines is very similar in nature. <#> However there may be differences in how the processors and memory interact; for example, in the Cray X-MP the connections between processors and memory are direct while on the Alliant and Convex a bus is used to connect memory and processors. <#> The latter machines incorporate a data cache memory to provide acceptable access times, but it is not significant enough to disrupt their classification as shared memory machines. <#> Such factors are not relevant as far as the programming of these machines is concerned. </p>
 <p> <#> In general, the main tactic of parallelisation systems is to examine nested DO loops, with the object of vectorising the innermost loop and parallelising the outermost loop. <#> The methods rely on data dependence analysis techniques that determine the flow of data in a program. <#> This, in turn, enables statements to be identified that can be executed in parallel. <#> Data dependence analysis is the cornerstone on which all automatic parallelism detection methods are built; the quality of a paralleliser is directly related to the quality of the dependence analyser. </p>
 <p> <#> Currently techniques are available for nested DO loops but have not yet been commercially applied to complete programs. <#> This requires full interprocedural analysis - the tracking of data across procedure calls - to be performed on a user program. <#> Once a compiler uses interprocedural information as a basis for compiling time decisions, data dependencies between procedures in a program can be resolved. <#> The systems at Rice University and IBM provide a limited form of interprocedural analysis. </p>
 <p> <#> There are certain parallel programming situations that can be automatically parallelised without any user intervention. <#> The most straightforward situation consists of loops with no data dependency between the iterations. <#> In this case the iterations can be assigned to the processors either individually or in groups depending on the scheduling algorithms. <#> In some systems the programmer can decide. </p>
 <p> <#> In other situations if there is a possibility of a data dependency the compiler takes a conservative view, which usually means that no parallelisation is attempted. <#> The burden is then placed on the programmer to decide if the compiler 's decision should be overridden; this is achieved by a user inserting compiler directives into the program code. <#> This is particularly the case in situations where interprocedural analysis is required as most existing systems are not capable of performing this analysis. <#> This is not always an easy decision and can require a considerable level of skill on behalf of the programmer. <#> To help with parallelisation several manufacturers have incorporated into their hardware special features to handle synchronisation of the processors. <#> This, in turn, can be used when processing, in parallel, different iterations of a DO loop that has data dependencies. <#> For example, the Alliant machines have a concurrency control bus that is used to reduce the overhead involved in processor synchronisation and can be utilised in loops with data dependencies. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> CANNABIS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Cannabis is one of the oldest plants cultivated by man. <#> Archaeological evidence from a Stone Age village, excavated on the island of Taiwan, suggests that mankind has been using the plant <it> Cannabis sativa </it> from earliest times. </p>
 <p> <#> The cannabis plant is a very adaptable annual, which can grow in most parts of the world including Ireland. <#> In its chequered career, it has been grown for its long fibres known as hemp fibre, for its seed (hemp seed), used as a source of oil and for bird seed, and most notably for the intoxicating resin produced in its leaves, flowers and fruits. <#> The drug form of cannabis has also been used for many centuries in many countries as a medicine. <#> The characteristic chemicals called cannabinoids (of which there are at least 60 found in the plant) are currently being tested for use in modern medicine to treat glaucoma (a disease which causes gradual blindness), to prevent the nausea and vomiting caused by some anti-cancer drugs, and possibly to treat epilepsy. </p>
 <p> <#> The cannabis plant produces over 400 different chemicals, the most important of which are the main psychoactive compounds, the tetrahydrocannabinols (THC). <#> However other cannabinoids may modify the effect of THC. <#> Different cannabis products contain different amounts of THC. <#> Herbal cannabis, known as marijuana, pot, grass or dope contains between 0 and 11 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC, depending on the source. <#> The resin, known as hashish or 'hash', contains between 1 and 26 <*> per cent sign </*> THC. <#> The resin is squeezed or scraped from the flowering tops of the plant, and then compressed into blocks or slabs and not allowed to solidify. <#> This is the commonest form of cannabis used in Ireland. <#> The strongest form of cannabis is an oil called 'hash oil' prepared by extracting or distilling the cannabinoids from the plant. <#> This form generally contains about 30 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC but samples containing up to 60 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC have been encountered. <#> Abroad it has been noted that the marijuana now on the market is at 7 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC, over 600 times more potent than in 1974 and at times may be even stronger than hash even though the herb form is usually considered to be the weakest form of the drug. <#> Little is known about the THC content of the cannabis drugs available in Ireland. <#> One sample of cannabis grown in Ireland was found to contain nearly 4 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC, while other samples were nearly devoid of any active drug. <#> In Ireland cannabis is usually smoked in home-made cigarettes called 'joints'. <#> In the case of the resin and oil they are usually mixed with tobacco. <#> Cannabis can also be smoked in pipes, made into a drink or put into cakes or biscuits. <#> The variation in THC content described above makes it difficult to accurately predict the effects of a given sample of cannabis. <#> Adding to this variability is the fact that the amount of cannabis used per dose also varies considerably. <#> One study has shown the THC content of street 'joints' to vary from 0.15 mg up to 41 mg where 5 mg of THC per joint would be the minimum for a drug effect to occur. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Legal Status </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> All cannabis products are controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act. <#> Cannabis is included in Schedule 1 which prohibits its medical and non-medical use. <#> It is therefore illegal to grow, produce, supply or possess any of the drugs except in accordance with a licence from the Minister of Health for research or analysis. <#> It is also an offence to allow premises to be used for cultivating, supplying or smoking cannabis. <#> The penalties for possession of small amounts of cannabis herb and cannabis resin for personal use are, for a first offence, a fine of up to <*> pound sign </*> 300 imposed by the District Court or up to <*> pound sign </*> 500 in the Circuit Court. <#> For a second offence, the District Court can impose a fine of up to <*> pound sign </*> 400, which rises to <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 if imposed by the Circuit Court. <#> In the case of a third or subsequent offence, the District Court can impose a maximum fine of <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 or 12 months in jail or both. <#> If the case is heard before a judge and jury, the maximum penalty can be an open-ended fine or 3 years imprisonment, or both fine and prison sentence. <#> Cultivation, supply and possession of the isolated chemicals (cannabinoids) are treated more severely. <#> (See section on Drug Laws for further details). </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Prevalence and Availability. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Cannabis is apparently the most widely used of the illegal drugs but we have no idea of exactly how many Irish people have experimented with it, or use it regularly. <#> There is little doubt that cannabis use has increased dramatically since 1969. <#> A survey of university students in Cork in 1977 showed that 19 <*> per cent sign </*> had experimented with the drug. <#> The most recent indications are that 13 <*> per cent sign </*> of Dublin post primary school children surveyed had used cannabis at least once. <#> The experimentation rate increased with age, with 2.3 <*> per cent sign </*> of those under 13 reporting use of the drug compared to 24.6 <*> per cent sign </*> in those 17 or over. <#> Experimentation rates in rural school children are believed to be lower than those in Dublin. <#> Large numbers of patients attending the Drug Clinic report cannabis use, and prosecutions for cannabis-related offences represent between 60 and 70 <*> per cent sign </*> of all prosecutions under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. </p>
 <p> <#> Prices for different cannabis products range from <*> pound sign </*> 1 per gramme of homegrown herb, to <*> pound sign </*> 3 per gramme of imported herb. <#> Cannabis resin such as Lebanese Gold, Pakistani Black or Moroccan Red can cost between <*> pound sign </*> 5 and <*> pound sign </*> 10 per gramme. <#> The cannabis smuggled into Ireland comes from a variety of countries in North Africa, the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent and America. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Short-Term Effects. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The effects of cannabis depend on a number of factors, including the type of cannabis used (hash and hash oil have greater and longer lasting effects than the relatively weaker marijuana), the way it has been stored (cannabinoids are unstable in light and air), the amount used, the way it is taken, and the experience, mood and expectations of the user. </p>
 <p> <#> When smoked, cannabis exerts its effects very quickly. <#> The effects last up to one hour with low doses, and for several hours with higher doses. <#> When it is eaten or drunk, it takes one to two hours to have an effect. <#> The dose is not easily controlled and unpleasant reactions are more likely and more severe. <#> Inexperienced cannabis users usually require some training in order to recognise the effects of the drug. </p>
 <p> <#> The sought-after effects, referred to as the 'high', include talkativeness, hilarity, euphoria, relaxation and a feeling of slowed time. <#> Usual doses of cannabis also interfere with short-term memory and learning ability, with obvious implications for students and school-children trying to learn while 'high'. <#> The more complex the task the more it is likely to be disrupted. <#> Frequent heavy cannabis users are likely to have poor academic records, high levels of absenteeism from class and a high drop-out rate from the educational system. <#> Moderate doses may also interfere with clarity of speech, resulting in communication of irrelevant words and ideas. <#> Recent studies in adolescents show that impairment of recent memory in heavy cannabis users is still detectable after a 6 week drug-free interval. <#> Adult cannabis users in the U.S. also report memory impairment and 45 <*> per cent sign </*> of those surveyed stated that their ability to concentrate on complex tasks, to think clearly and to get things done was impaired. <#> Motor co-ordination is also impaired at usual dose levels, affecting a person 's ability to operate machinery, fly a plane or drive a car. <#> This impairment lasts for some hours after the 'high'. <#> Evidence continues to increase in other countries showing that cannabis contributes to the high level of fatal car, truck, airplane and train crashes among cannabis users. <#> In many studies cannabis users report higher rates of traffic accidents than non-users and the percentage of those killed or injured in accidents who had been smoking cannabis is the same as for alcohol users. <#> The very common combination of alcohol and cannabis produces greater damage than either drug alone, although little is known about the consequences of using cannabis and other drugs together. </p>
 <p> <#> An increasing number of cannabis users (especially the inexperienced) using the stronger forms of the drug now available report adverse reactions to the drug. <#> These unpleasant reactions include fearfulness, confusion, severe panic and anxiety, paranoid reactions and hallucinations. <#> These reactions, although frequently very frightening, rarely require medical attention and usually respond to reassurance. <#> There would appear to be no danger of an overdose and no deaths in humans have been reported. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Long-Term Effects. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Because widespread regular use of cannabis by such groups as children, adolescents, girls and women is a relatively new phenomenon, the consequences of long-term use, particularly of the highly potent drugs now available, are less conclusively documented than the short term effects. <#> A large number of studies with animals have consistently demonstrated toxic effects at doses comparable to those taken by humans who smoke marijuana several times a day. <#> Studies of human cannabis users have been contradictory in their results and in many cases the evidence is inconclusive. <#> This is probably due to the fact that the correct types of long-term studies on humans have not yet been carried out. </p>
 <p> <#> When burned, cannabis cigarettes produce three times more carcinogenic 'tars' than tobacco and five times more poisonous carbon monoxide. <#> Prolonged heavy use of the drug causes chronic bronchitis, cough, hoarseness, laryngitis and pre-cancerous changes in the lungs similar to those produced by tobacco smoke, except that the changes and lung damage occur more rapidly with cannabis smoke. <#> Cannabis tar is directly carcinogenic in animals and earlier predictions that long-term cannabis use could lead to cases of cancer in humans are proving accurate in that cases of lung, head and neck cancer have been reported in young cannabis smokers. <#> In addition, babies born to mothers who smoked cannabis were, according to one report, ten times more likely to develop acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia than babies whose mothers did not smoke cannabis. </p>
 <p> <#> Cannabis is not usually considered to produce physical dependence, although tolerance to the effects occurs, and physical withdrawal symptoms have been noted after cessation of heavy use. <#> Psychological dependence has been noted in some users. <#> Cannabis increases the workload of the heart and people who suffer from heart disease, angina and blood pressure are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of cannabis. <#> Another high risk group are those with pre-existing mental illness, particularly schizophrenia and depression, because cannabis may trigger off a relapse or make symptoms worse. <#> There has been a steep increase in the number of patients admitted to Swedish psychiatric hospitals with a diagnosis of acute anxiety, delirium, schizophrenia and psychosis attributed to cannabis use. </p>
 <p> <#> Among the other known or suspected long term effects of continuous cannabis use are decreased sperm count and sperm mobility, interference with ovulation and pre-natal development and impaired immune response. <#> There is now a considerable body of evidence concerning the adverse effects of cannabis on both male and female reproductive systems. <#> Not only does the drug affect the secretion of hormones and the reproductive glands directly but it also inhibits sexual activity and produces long-term alterations in the development of the reproductive system in male and female offspring in test animals. <#> In addition, cannabinoid metabolites are highly fat soluble and remain in the body for several weeks. <#> During that time the chemicals are concentrated in areas of the brain known to influence various aspects of sexual behaviour as well as in the endocrine and sex glands. </p>
 <p> <#> There is also increasing evidence of problems arising if cannabis is smoked during pregnancy because the infant is exposed to the drug via the placenta and also through breast milk after it is born. <#> Studies in the U.S. report that up to 27 <*> per cent sign </*> of pregnant women had used cannabis during pregnancy. <#> The babies born to these mothers weighed less than those born to non-users and were significantly shorter in length. <#> The cannabis babies had less muscle mass than normal and were more jittery, more irritable and less attentive. <#> If the mother also used alcohol and tobacco, the combined effect of the three drugs was greater than any individual drug. </p>

 <h> <bold> <it> <#> 3 The Syntax of Space </it> </h>
 <h> <#> 3.1 Spatial Organization - Nominal Loci and Verb Directionality </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In so far as the production and recognition of visual patterns is dependent on spatial distinctions, it is of course trivially true that spatial organization constitutes one dimension of sign language, just as it is true that speech can be described in acoustic terms. <#> The description of sign in terms of its use of space can thus proceed on what we might term the 'phonetic' level. <#> But it is also the case that the spatial dimension can lay claim to significance on the syntactic level of explanation also - as indeed on the level of discourse, though this will not be our primary concern here. <#> In this chapter I will attempt to provide a framework within which the analysis of 'spatial syntax' in HPSG terms might proceed. <#> To begin with, I will look at the association of nominals with locations in signing space; following this I will explore the way in which certain verbs exploit this mechanism of 'spatial indexing'. </p>
 <p> <#> Referring nominals in ASL are frequently associated with particular points, usually called <it> loci, </it> in signing space (Lillo-Martin and Klima 1990, Meier 1990, van Hoek 1992). <#> The effect of this assignment of location is analogous to the assignment of abstract indices that is generally assumed in syntactic, and indeed discourse-oriented, accounts of reference and coreference: a locus is uniquely associated with the referent of the nominal, and this association may be exploited to refer anaphorically to the referent at any point in the succeeding discourse. <#> In principle, there is no limit on the number of loci that may be established. <#> A locus can be assigned to a referent in one of a number of ways (Lillo-Martin 1986). <#> If the referent is an entity physically present, then that entity's actual location will, in general, function as its locus. <sp> 1 </sp> <#> An entity not present in the signing situation may acquire a locus through being signed in a particular, arbitrary position on its first appearance in the discourse, or it may be signed in neutral space and then explicitly assigned a locus through pointing. <#> Alternatively, the signer may gaze at the locus while making the relevant sign. </p>
 <p> <#> Once established, a locus can be exploited referentially in a number of ways. <#> Most obvious, perhaps, is the case of reported conversation; here, the signer commonly adopts the role of each of the participants in the reported conversation in turn. <#> The role being played at a given moment is indicated by body orientation and gaze, and these parameters are determined by the loci assigned to the (absent) speaker and addressee. <sp> 2 </sp> <#> Loci are also exploited in a way that is apparently analogous to pronominal reference in spoken language: this is achieved by pointing to the appropriate locus with the index finger. <#> Meier (1990) points out that while it is clear that ASL has gestures which, in certain contexts, are best rendered in spoken languages as personal pronouns, it does not follow <it> necessarily </it> that these are in fact pronouns in the same sense, since the use of pointing to indicate reference in discourse is nearly universal in human communication but is not generally considered to be a linguistic phenomenon. <#> However, Meier goes on to adduce evidence in support of the view that the pointing employed in ASL is linguistic in nature; among his arguments are the fact that deictic point-gestures are interspersed with unambiguously linguistic signs, and the fact that similar syntactic constraints apply to their distribution as to that of other signs. <#> Finally, spatial loci also play an important role in designating the participants in the relation introduced by certain kinds of verbs, and in specifying their role in the relation. <#> In this chapter I will be concerned with capturing the pronominal and verbal uses of space in ASL. </p>

 <p> <#> One argument mitigating against the claim that ASL pointing signs are pronominal is that, since there is in principle no limit to the number of loci that may be established in signing-space, there must also be no limit to the number of pronouns that must be present in the lexicon. <#> If we accept this, then we must accept that there is indeed a substantial qualitative difference between the pronominal system of ASL and that of any spoken language, since there is no known spoken language that has an open-ended inventory of pronouns. <#> Now, it is certainly true that, if we accept ASL points as pronouns, we must also accept that each entity in a given discourse may receive a uniquely assigned pronominal form. <#> The English pronominal system must be considered sadly impoverished by comparison; any number of individual male referents in a discourse, for example, must be content to share a single <it> he </it> among themselves. <#> GB theory and HPSG share a belief, however, that this degenerate paradigm is the surface manifestation of an underlying abstract, but psychologically real system of reference-tracking that involves abstract entities called <it> indices.</it>  <#> These, like spatial loci in ASL, are uniquely assigned to referents, and must hence be assumed to be infinite in number, since an infinite number of distinct referents may in principle be referred to in a given discourse. <#> In HPSG, as we have seen, it is assumed that part of the informational composition of indices are the parameters alluded to above, namely, person, number and gender (for English, at least). <#> For Pollard and Sag (1994), these features serve simply to help distinguish indices from one another:
 <quote> <#> Indices bear formal agreement features, in much the same way that pushpins employed by military strategists to represent army divisions might come in different colors to represent different countries.  (p.72) </quote>
 <#> Hence, the fact that there is a limited variety of pronouns in spoken languages is a consequence of the limitations imposed by the taxonomy of pronominal forms; pronominal agreement systems are multidimensional, but the set of possible classifications along each descriptive axis is nonetheless discrete and finite. <#> The visual modality of a sign language, on the other hand, permits an alternative system of formally marking distinctions among referents; instead of labelling indices with features corresponding to qualities inherent in the referents to which they are anchored, <sp> 3 </sp> they can be associated with physical locations, arbitrarily assigned or actual. <#> It happens to be a property of such a system that, like color-coding, it allows distinctions along a continuum; there is therefore potentially an infinitude of overt distinctions corresponding to the theoretical infinitude of indices. <#> Also like colour-coding of course, the upper bound on the number of distinctions that can in practice be made is determined by the limits on the precision with which humans can distinguish between adjacent points on a continuum. </p>
 <p> <#> The important point here is that there is in principle no conflict between the facts of ASL and the understanding of reference assumed in GB or HPSG. <#> Each of these theories does in fact posit unique indices for each referent in a given discourse; the formal features of spoken language merely fail to reflect this. <#> It is a consequence of the modality of ASL (and other sign languages) that they have the means to reflect overtly the one-to-one nature of index-referent mapping. </p>
 <p> <#> We saw in the previous chapter how HPSG deals with indices in relation to nominals: they are treated as being inherent to particular lexical nominals. <#> Thus, <it> book </it> is specified in the lexicon as introducing an index with the agreement features 3rd, singular, neuter. <#> There are only as many pronouns in the HPSG lexicon as there are morphological distinctions between pronominal forms according to agreement features; <quote> 'doubling-up' </quote> of pronominal function in a single form is easily captured thanks to the partial nature of information supplied by lexical feature structures. <#> Thus, English <it> you </it> is unspecified for number and gender; the former may be supplied by the morphology of a verb subcategorizing it as a subject, the latter by virtue of coindexation, hence unification, with a nominal introducing a gender-specific index. <#> However, if we adopt this account of pronouns for ASL, then we will indeed have to posit an infinitude of lexical pronouns, each introducing a distinct index, each one specified for a different morphology - i.e., a different locus. <#> Standard HPSG thus does not appear to provide a satisfactory account of the pronominal system of ASL. </p>
 <h>  <it> <#> 3.1.2  Directional verbs and the HPSG account of verb agreement </it> </h>
 <p> <#> A further difficulty is presented by the phenomenon of directional verbs. <#> ASL verbs can be broadly divided into two classes: <it> non-directional </it> and <it> directional. </it>  <#> Directional verbs in turn come in two varieties, <it> uni-directional </it> and <it> bi-directional. </it> <#> Directional verbs, as the designation suggests, typically involve a specific movement from one locus towards another. <#> In the case of uni-directional verbs, this movement often originates at a particular (invariant) point on the signer 's body and moves towards the locus assigned to the entity filling the patient role <sp> 4 </sp> in the semantic relation described by the verb. <#> Thus, TELL, for instance, begins with a handshape at the signer 's chin and moves towards the appropriate object locus. <#> Both the origin and the target of movement of bi-directional verbs are dictated by the roles they assign: the agent 's locus is the starting point and, again, the patient 's locus is the movement 's end-point; GIVE is such a verb. <#> Plain verbs are those whose form is not affected by role-allocation, such as UNDERSTAND. <#> There is a consensus among researchers into ASL as to how these verbal phenomena are best treated: one aspect of the form of a directional verb in ASL - its movement - is dependent on its arguments; since there is a clear analogy between such a dependency and the verb agreement phenomena which are pervasive in spoken languages, it is considered appropriate to analyze them in the same terms. <#> Thus, directional verbs are often referred to as <it> inflecting </it> and non-directional verbs as <it> plain </it> verbs. </p>
 <p> <#> In GB theory, verb agreement is a phenomenon arising out of movement to the verbal node of an autonomous, structurally represented segment (INFL, or AGR) comprising <quote> 'a bundle of features' </quote> (to use the standard locution) - or, possibly, movement of the verb to the node containing the agreement features. <#> In either case, agreement is construed as a morphological mechanism that is located in the grammar, and agreement features exist independently of particular verbs. <#> In HPSG, by contrast, the standard assumption is that verb agreement is best dealt with in the lexicon. <#> Agreement features are not encoded directly on verbs, however; rather, it is assumed that agreement is a direct consequence of argument selection. <#> Since the elements of a head 's valence lists are <it> synsem </it> objects, it follows that verbs are capable of selecting the INDEX feature of their NP arguments. <#> An English third-singular verb is thus one that selects a subject NP whose INDEX has the features [PERS <it> 3rd </it>] and [NUM <it> sing </it>]. <#> The inflectional paradigm is captured by lexical rules specifying that particular phonological functions on the base form are constrained to accompany particular argument selections; hence, in English there is a <it> 3rd-singular </it> lexical rule that derives, from a verbal base form, a verb that has 3rd-singular morphology and the index of whose subject has 3-rd singular agreement features.  </p>
 <p> <#> We have observed that, if we adhere to standard HPSG assumptions, we must posit the existence in the ASL lexicon of an infinitude of pronominal forms. <#> Given the HPSG understanding of the nature of verb agreement, there is an even more acute problem in the case of verbs. <#> Just as there is theoretically an infinity of pronominal forms, so we must assume that the inflectional paradigm for each directional verb is open-ended; and, given the foregoing assumptions, we must also assume that each form is lexically represented. <#> Clearly, while the number of inflectional forms available for uni-directional verbs is equal to the number of available indices, the number of forms of bi-directional verbs approaches the square of this figure. <#> Lexical rules cannot simplify matters here; since each distinct inflectional form requires a distinct lexical rule to derive it, the number of lexical rules needed will be equal to the number of verbal forms. </p>

 <#> <bold> TURLOUGHS </bold> </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> TURLOUGHS are lakes which disappear for part of the year, leaving a floor covered with grasses, sedges and herbs. <#> They occur in limestone areas west of the Shannon and are unique to Ireland. <#> Their flora and fauna are very interesting, and if there is one in your area, it is an ideal site for an environmental study. <#> Many turloughs have been drained and both arterial drainage and local drainage by farmers threaten those that remain. <#> Some representative turloughs should be conserved, as it would be a tragedy if this unique part of our heritage were to disappear forever. </bold> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> SEASONAL LAKES </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> If you drive through part of eastern Galway or Mayo in the winter, you will see a large number of lakes and you may be puzzled that they do not appear on the half-inch to a mile Ordnance Survey maps. <#> If you look a bit closer, you may wonder why some of the lakes have walls leading down into them, or telegraph poles in the middle of them. <#> Then, if you return to the area in the summer, you will find no sign of these lakes, but instead a landscape with green fields and grazing cattle. <#> Only a few clues, such as the black moss covering the stone walls, indicate that these are no ordinary fields. <#> In fact, they are turloughs.</p>
 <p> <#> Turlough, or <it> turlach </it> , is the word used to describe these strange disappearing lakes which are found in limestone areas of Ireland, mostly west of the Shannon. <#> The name is thought to come from the Irish ""tur loch"", meaning dry lake. <#> The features are unique to Ireland and they are an important part of our heritage. <#> They are of great interest to many scientists: geomorphologists (who study landforms) are interested in how turloughs were formed, hydrologists (who study water) try to explain what makes turloughs flood, botanists study the unusual vegetation which covers the <}> <-> turloughs </-> <+> turlough 's </+> </}> floor and zoologists study the animals associated with the turloughs. <#> Because they have so many interesting aspects, turloughs provide an ideal opportunity for local environmental studies. </p>
 <p> <#> Turloughs are mostly found on the central lowlands west of the Shannon, in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo and Roscommon, although a few are also found elsewhere, e.g. in Limerick, Sligo and Longford. <#> Most turloughs flood in the autumn, usually some time in October, and then dry up some time between April and July. <#> However, some turloughs in the Burren can flood at any time of year in a matter of a few hours after heavy rainfall and they may empty again a few days later. <#> A few turloughs are affected by the tide: in the summer, Caherglassaun Lough, which is 5 km from Galway Bay, can be seen to flood and empty again twice every 24 hours. <#> Most turloughs flood to a depth of about 2 metres but some are much deeper: for example, some of the turloughs near Gort are about five metres (16 ft.) deep in midwinter. <#> Turloughs are variable in size: the largest turlough in Ireland, Rahasane, which lies to the west of Craughwell in Co. Galway, covers about 250 hectares (or 500 football pitches!).</p>
 <h> <bold> <#> WHY DO TURLOUGHS OCCUR? </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> All of the turloughs are found in limestone areas. <#> This is because limestone is a unique rock in that it can be dissolved away by rainwater, particularly rainwater that has become acidic by picking up carbon dioxide as it passes through the soil. <#> The cracks or <it> joints </it> in the rock become widened to such an extent that eventually all of the rain falling on the limestone disappears underground and the water moves through the rock openings ranging from cracks a few millimetres wide to large cave passages. <#> The limestone is then said to <it> karstified </it> . <#> To the east of the Shannon, the limestone is often covered by great thicknesses of glacial drift deposited during the Ice Age but in many areas to the west of the Shannon where the limestone is pure and the drift cover is thin, there is no proper surface river network. <#> In these areas, rainfall disappears underground, flows through openings in the rock and then rises at springs: large springs are found to the west of the area, flowing into Lough Corrib and Galway Bay. <#> In winter, when the underground water level (or <it> water table </it> ) rises, and when the underground flow routes to the springs are not capable of dealing with the amount of water entering them, groundwater may appear temporarily at the surface in the form of a turlough. <#> Many of the rivers seen in these areas today are largely artificial, constructed by drainage engineers from the nineteenth century to the present day, often linking a series of turloughs. <#> For example, much of the Clare river is artificial and the middle section of its course used to be a huge turlough - the largest in Ireland at 650 hectares.</p>
 <h> <bold> <#> SWALLOW HOLES </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Turloughs usually fill and empty at particular places on the floor: sometimes an actual hold or passage is visible but more often a hollow with stones in the bottom is all that can be seen and it may not be easy to recognise when it is dry in midsummer. <#> Some turloughs have a spring at one place and a swallow hole somewhere else on the floor where water drains away, but many turloughs fill and empty through the same hole. <#> A few turloughs are filled by rivers and streams flowing into them as well by water rising from underground.</p>
 <p> <#> The water sinking in the swallow hole travels underground to a spring, which may be several kilometres away. <#> In most rock types, groundwater flows very slowly (from just a few centimetres to a few metres per day), but in karstified limestone the flow rate can be quite rapid: water from the turlough may flow underground to a spring at a rate of 100 metres per hour or more. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> CALCIUM CARBONATE </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Limestone is made up of the mineral calcium carbonate and as water passes through limestone, it dissolves the calcium carbonate - this is what makes the water hard and causes furring on the inside of kettles, as the calcium carbonate comes out of solution when the water is heated. <#> Something rather similar happens in turloughs - water which has picked up a lot of calcium carbonate during its underground travel rises in the turloughs and then some of the calcium carbonate comes out of solution and forms a white deposit. <#> So if you visit a turlough which has emptied recently, you may notice a whitish coating on the vegetation on the turlough floor. <#> (The reason why the calcium carbonate is deposited is that when the water comes to the surface in a turlough, it loses carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere and to plants which use it for photosynthesis and this loss causes the calcium carbonate to come out of solution.) </p>
 <p> <#> Sometimes a special whitish deposit which has the appearance of sheets of paper is found in the turloughs when they dry up. <#> This ""algal paper"" is made up of filaments of an alga which grows abundantly in warm weather and is then left to dry out in sheets when the turlough empties. </p>
 <p> <#> If you look at a section in a drainage ditch in a turlough, or if you make a hole with a soil auger, you may find a white or cream coloured deposit beneath the vegetation cover, or beneath a layer of peat. <#> This is often called ""white marl"" - again it is made of calcium carbonate. <#> About half of the turloughs contain marl: it was deposited at a time several thousand years ago when these turloughs were not seasonal lakes but were flooded all year round. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Most turloughs have a springy, short-cropped turf of grasses, sedges and herbs. <#> In the Burren, the highwater-mark is often shown by the shrubby cinquefoil with its attractive yellow flowers, and meadow rue. <#> Just below, dog violets are abundant and in some turloughs there may be a dense sward of the rare sky-blue turlough violet about one metre further down. <#> Other characteristic plant of turlough sides include orchids and speedwell. <#> About half way down the sides, and across the bottom of shallow turloughs, silverweed may blanket almost all other plants. </p>
 <p> <#> If the turlough has a marshy zone near the swallow hole, there may be mint, water-cress, pond-weeds, aquatic buttercups and knotgrass, living a semi-terrestrial existence. <#> But most swallow holes when dry are represented by a jumble of rocks, clothes with blackish and dried aquatic mosses (<it> Cinclidotus </it> , the turlough moss and <it> Fontinalis </it> , usually found in streams). </p>
 <p> <#> Many people think that turloughs have no animal life. <#> However, frogs and newts may spawn there and sticklebacks may survive in the larger turloughs, retreating into underground cracks in the rock when waters are low. <#> Shrimp and water-lice do the same and where fish are absent there may be a rich fauna of delicate water-fleas and fairy-shrimp, some unknown elsewhere in Ireland. <#> These hatch and grow fast, finding safety in the warm fishless waters. <#> Flatworms and snails are also often abundant; these pass the dry periods in springmouths or marshy areas. </p>
 <p> <#> When turloughs retain some water all year, they may be important bird haunts. <#> Rahasane in Galway is famous for its white-fronted geese, whooper swans, wigeon, teal and many waders in winter. <#> Others may not suit the large migratory birds, but their importance to resident warblers and other small birds has never been studied. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> DRAINING OF TURLOUGHS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Turloughs provide good summer grazing for cattle, sheep and horses, partly because of the annual deposition of lime-rich silt. <#> However, for many years, farmers have seen the winter flooding as a waste of potential and they have attempted to find some means of draining the turloughs, so that they can be used all year round. <#> This has usually been achieved by digging an artificial channel through the turlough, which is capable of carrying away any water entering the turlough from surface or groundwater - such channels have often been constructed as part of major arterial drainage schemes. <#> At least a third of the turloughs in Ireland have already been drained and more are being drained each year. <#> This has very serious consequences from the point of view of the environmentalist - the unique flora and fauna of the turlough cannot survive in the absence of seasonal flooding. <#> Even for the farmer, the benefits are not always as great as anticipated - the stopping of the annual limey silt deposition means that the soil may become impoverished and fertilisers must be used. <#> Also, the poorly developed, delicate soil may not be able to withstand the presence of animals through the winter. </p>
 <p> <#> To suggest that no more turloughs should be drained is a rather extreme view but the case for conserving at least some of them is very strong - it would be a great loss if this unique part of our heritage were to disappear for ever. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> THINGS TO DO </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> If you have a turlough near you, there are plenty of things to observe and record. <#> You can measure the changes in water level over a year by placing a series of measuring sticks in the turlough. <#> When the turlough is filling and emptying, you can locate the springs and swallow holes. </p>
 <p> <#> Notice how the vegetation changes as you move down the slope to the deepest parts - can you relate these changes to the time for which each part is flooded? <#> If you have a soil auger, you can investigate the deposits: you are most likely to find peat or marl on the bottom, and glacial till (with clay and larger stones) on the slopes. <#> Is the changing vegetation related to the type of deposits? </p>
 <p> <#> Does your turlough have a characteristic plankton or other animal forms? <#> How quickly does the animal community develop? <#> Are there fish present and if so, what type? <#> Do birds visit the turlough in the winter? <#> Learn to identify the birds and carry out regular counts through the winter. <#> Does the presence or absence of birds seem to relate to a particular feature, such as the shape <}> <-> of </-> <+> or </+> </}> size of the turlough, reedy vegetation, or the other animals present? </p>

 <&> tables and figures </&>
 <h> <bold> <#> The business </bold> </h> <p> <#> Irish Permanent is a leading retail financial services group in the Republic of Ireland. <#> Its products include mortgages, savings, investments, life assurance and pensions and other retail financial services. </p>
 <p> <#> At 31 December, 1993, Irish Permanent was the largest building society in the Republic of Ireland measured in terms of total assets, profits and reserves. <#> At that date, its total assets of <*> pound sign </*> 2.7 billion (including mortgage loans of <*> pound sign </*> 1.9 billion) represented approximately 35 per cent. of the total assets of <*> pound sign </*> 7.8 billion of all Irish building societies. <#> Irish Permanent is the fourth largest banking group in the Republic of Ireland measured in terms of total assets at 31 December, 1993 and, in the view of the Directors, continues to be the leading provider of residential mortgage finance. </p>
 <p> <#> In 1992 and 1993, Irish Permanent was the leading mortgage lender in the Republic of Ireland. <#> With new mortgage advances of some <*> pound sign </*> 323 million in 1993, it achieved a market share of approximately 24 per cent. in that year. <#> The total of residential mortgage loans outstanding for all credit institutions reporting to the Central Bank in the Republic of Ireland at 31 December, 1993 amounted to approximately <*> pound sign </*> 7.3 billion. <#> Irish Permanent 's residential mortgage portfolio of approximately <*> pound sign </*> 1.7 billion at that date represented some 23 per cent. of such loans. <#> Statistics are, however, not available on the total residential mortgage loans outstanding by all lenders in the market. <#> At 31 December, 1991, 1992 and 1993 respectively, Irish Permanent had a market share of interest-bearing saving balances in the Republic of Ireland in the range of 6-7 per cent. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Competitive strengths </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Irish Permanent 's major competitive strengths which, in the view of the Directors, constitute a sound basis for the Group 's development following flotation, include:
 <#> a substantial customer base comprising over 79,000 mortgage accounts and over 590,000 savings and deposit accounts;
 <#> an extensive distribution network comprising 93 branches and 100 agencies in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and a banking subsidiary in the Isle of Man;
 <#> a range of complementary mortgage, savings, investments, life assurance and pension products; <#> an experienced and innovative management team; <#> nationally recognised and respected brand names; <#> a committed staff providing a high standard of customer service; <#> strict credit control procedures and prudent lending policies, which have historically resulted in a low level of loan losses;
 <#> access to the equity and debt capital markets, in the latter case facilitated by the investment grade long term debt rating, A2, as assigned to Irish Permanent by Moody 's Investors Service; and <#> a strong capital base and balance sheet which should facilitate a significant expansion of both current and new activities. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Distribution network </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Irish Permanent has an extensive network of branches and agencies for the distribution of its products and services in the Republic of Ireland. <#> The branch network provides the major point of contact with the majority of Irish Permanent 's customers and is the principal outlet for Irish Permanent 's mortgage, saving and money transmission products and services. </p>
 <&> figures </&>
 <h> <bold> <#> Prudential Life of Ireland </bold> </h> <p> <#> On 30 June, 1994, Irish Permanent acquired Prudential Life of Ireland, a significant life assurance and pensions business in the Republic of Ireland, at a cost of <*> pound sign </*> 31.9 million (including acquisition costs) out of existing liquid resources. <#> The fair value, including embedded value, of Prudential Life of Ireland at that date amounted to <*> pound sign </*> 29.8 million. <#> The goodwill of <*> pound sign </*> 2.1 million so arising was written off against the reserves of Irish Permanent at 30 June, 1994. <#> No contribution from Prudential Life of Ireland is included in the consolidated profit and loss account of the Group for the six months ended 30 June, 1994. <#> The assets and liabilities of Prudential Life of Ireland are included in the consolidated balance sheet of the Group at 30 June, 1994. </p>
 <p> <#> Prudential Life of Ireland develops, markets and underwrites life assurance policies, pension policies and certain other products, including single premium products, in the Republic of Ireland. <#> Its life assurance products are mainly regular premium unit-linked life assurance protection and savings policies. </p>
 <p> <#> In the year ended 31 December, 1993 and the six months ended 30 June, 1994, Prudential Life of Ireland generated embedded value after tax earnings of <*> pound sign </*> 4.2 million and <*> pound sign </*> 2.4 million respectively. <#> Statutory earnings after tax for the same periods were <*> pound sign </*> 2.5 million and <*> pound sign </*> 1.2 million respectively. </p>
 <p> <#> The Directors intend to account for Prudential Life of Ireland in the accounts of the Group using the embedded value method, but will, also, provide information on statutory earnings. <#> The Directors consider that the embedded value earnings of Prudential Life of Ireland may exhibit greater volatility than the earnings for Irish Permanent 's banking business. </p>
 <p> <#> Further information on the accounting for the life assurance business of Prudential Life of Ireland is set out in the ""Guide to certain life assurance technical terms"" and on page 35 of the Listing Particular. <#> The assumptions made by the Directors in calculating embedded values for Prudential Life or Ireland are set out in the letter from Bacon <*> ampersand </*> Woodrow in Part IV of the Listing Particulars. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> On 31 August, 1994, Irish Permanent acquired Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon at a cost of <*> pound sign </*> 2.1 million and losses before tax of <*> pound sign </*> 56,000. <#> At 31 December, 1993, Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon had total assets of <*> pound sign </*> 99 million, of which <*> pound sign </*> 67 million were liquid assets. <#> Customer accounts at that date amounted to <*> pound sign </*> 70 million. </p>
 <p> <#> Irish Permanent intends to provide private banking services through Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Restrictions on shareholdings </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In compliance with the Act, the Articles restrict any person from having an interest in 15 per cent. or more of the Company 's issued share capital for a period of five years from the date of Conversion. <#> In addition, the Central Bank must approve any transaction involving the acquisition by a person or persons acting in concert of 10 per cent. or more of the voting rights of Shares of Irish Permanent. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Outlook for 1994 </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In 1994, Irish Permanent has continued to write profitable mortgages business without relaxing its stringent lending criteria. <#> However, greater competition in the residential mortgage market has resulted in a lower market share for new business and lower net interest margins for the Group. <#> Although trends since 30 June, 1994 lead the Directors to believe that the second half of the year will, as in previous years, reflect a greater level of lending activity, the Directors anticipate that the net interest margin and the results for this period will continue to reflect the competitive situation. </p>
 <p> <#> Irish Permanent 's performance in retail savings is ahead of budget. <#> Special Savings Accounts and the recently launched Irish Permanent Savings Certificates have proved particularly attractive to investors. <#> As a result of these and other product developments, the Directors are confident that 1994 will show a satisfactory increase in retail deposits. </p>
 <p> <#> Prudential Life of Ireland and Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon will make their first contributions to Group results in the second half of 1994. <#> Prudential Life of Ireland repriced its product range in the early part of the year and is maintaining satisfactory market share. <#> The Directors believe that recent trends in this business indicate that Prudential Life of Ireland will make a satisfactory contribution to Group results in 1994. <#> The Directors believe that the embedded value earnings of Prudential Life of Ireland may be more volatile than the earnings from Irish Permanent 's banking business. <#> The pre-tax results of Prudential Life of Ireland will be accounted for as ""Other operating income"" and will, therefore, have a beneficial impact on the Group 's cost:income ratio. <#> The Directors expect that Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon will report a small loss in 1994. <#> They are, however, confident that Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon can be returned to profitability in 1995. </p>
 <p> <#> The Directors continue to monitor costs closely and expect that operating costs in the second half will be broadly at the same level as in the first half. <#> They continue to target a cost:income ratio of 50 per cent. or below by 1998. </p>
 <p> <#> On the basis of the taxation charge provided in the six months ended 30 June, 1994 and the outlook for the year, the Directors expect that the taxation charge for 1994 will be materially below the standard rate of corporation tax of 40 per cent.. </p>
 <p> <#> In the light of results for the six months ended 30 June, 1994 and trading since that date, the Directors believe that the outcome for 1994 will be satisfactory. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Dividends </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> On the basis of current expectations and in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the Directors intend to recommend a final dividend of 6 pence per Share (net) for the year ending 31 December, 1994. <#> This is not a profit forecast. <#> No interim dividend has been or will be paid in respect of the current financial year. <#> It is intended that the first dividend paid by Irish Permanent will be the recommended final dividend forecast above. <#> This is expected to be paid in April 1995. </p>
 <p> <#> For subsequent financial years, the normal policy of the Directors will be to pay interim dividends in October and final dividends in April in proportions of approximately one-third and two-thirds, respectively, of the total annual dividend. </p>
 <p> <#> On the basis of the above expectations, the annualised dividend for 1994 would be 9 pence per Share (net), equivalent to 12 pence per Share inclusive of the related tax credit at the current rate. <#> This annualised dividend represents a gross yield, at the Offer Price, of approximately 6.67 per cent.. </p>
 <p> <#> The Directors intend, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, to pursue a progressive dividend policy which should produce real increases in dividends per Share subject to real growth in underlying profitability. <#> In determining dividend policy, the Directors will have particular regard to the stability of the gross dividend taking into account the related tax credit. </p>

 <p> <bold> <#> Rheumatoid <}> <-> Artiritis </-> <+> Arthritis </+> </}> affects between two and three per cent of the population, with three quarters of the sufferers female. <#> It is a chronic, usually progressive, inflammatory disease of the joints. <#> It usually attacks several joints and in some cases the onset is quite rapid and severe, but more often it develops over several months or even years. </bold> </p>
 <p> <#> The symptoms <}> <-> very </-> <+> vary </+> </{> from person to person. <#> These range from stiffness in the morning, painful and swollen joints, fatigues, to poor appetite and weight loss. </p>
 <p> <#> The inflammation is caused by a reaction between the white blood cells and various chemicals produced by the body. <#> The white blood cells invade the joint and release certain enzymes which secrete chemicals that cause the breakdown of cartilage and bone. </p>
 <p> <#> Medical experts are not sure what causes this chain of events to occur. <#> Some scientists believe rheumatoid arthritis is caused by a virus which causes infection in the arthritic joint. <#> The virus triggers the inflammatory process, but so far it has not been possible to identify the virus responsible for this. </p>
 <p> <#> Other researchers believe it is a malfunction in the body 's immune system. <#> The immune system normally produces antibodies which destroy bacteria and viruses. <#> In the case of rheumatoid arthritis is could be that these antibodies turn against healthy tissue in the body. <#> This is called an ""auto-immune response"". <#> But if there is no bacteria in the joint, why does the immune system ""attack""? </p>
 <p> <#> One theory is that inflammation and destruction in the rheumatoid joint triggers the production of heat shock proteins or stress proteins. <#> The stress proteins are found in all cells and are essential for survival. <#> It is only when they are subjected to ultra violet light, chemicals, heat etc. that they are produced in large quantities to protect the cells. <#> Some experts believe that the immune system may not be able to distinguish between bacterial or viral protein and one of the body 's own proteins, because they both have a similar amino acid structure. </p>
 <p> <#> Other causes of rheumatoid arthritis may be connected to free radical activity. <#> These are unstable chemicals that are made by the body and if they reach high levels they may cause many health problems, including the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
 <p> <#> Food intolerance may also be involved in this condition. <#> This has not been proved conclusively, but we know that certain foods can make joint pains worse, possibly due to increased acid levels in the blood. </p>

 <h> <#> J. Connell, B.Arch, MRIAI
 <#> Senior Research Architect, Environmental Research Unit </bold> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> 1. Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> For several years now members of the international radiation protection community have been expressing anxiety about the effect of natural radiation on the health of persons. <#> It is expected that this concern will be given concrete expression in this country when the Building Regulations are introduced. <#> They are expected to call for precautions to be taken to avoid danger to the health of occupants of buildings caused by radioactive substances in the ground under buildings. <#> This will include radon which is a radioactive gas. </p>
 <p> <#> Designers of buildings will be faced with a problem in complying with this requirement. <#> This arises firstly, due to the difficulty in predicting prior to construction the likelihood of harmful levels of indoor radon <}> <-> occuring </-> <+> occurring </+> </}> in the completed building and secondly, in advising on the type and extent of any precautions that should be taken at the design stage. <#> There is also the matter of legal liability. <#> It would be prudent at the present time for designers of houses, schools and certain other buildings of long time occupation, to raise the matter of radon protection with their clients, as otherwise, with the widespread awareness of the radiation problem, they could be held to be guilty of professional negligence. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 2. Facts about Radon </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> About 13 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total radiation exposure is made up from man-made nuclear and medical activities and the remaining 87 <*> per cent sign </*> from natural sources. <#> Exposure to any form of radiation may cause harm to the exposed person or his or her descendants and there is no intrinsic difference between artificial and natural radiation in their biological effects. <#> In contrast to the demand for strict controls over exposure to artificial radiation sources, relatively little attention has been given to control of exposures to natural sources. <#> This may have arisen partly from a feeling that what is natural is without harm and also from a lack of awareness about precautions which could be taken. <#> However, in recent years there has been a growing concern among those dealing with radiation matters about the long <}> <-> terms </-> <+> term </+> </}> effects of radiation at all levels and the circumstances where exposure could, and probably should, be reduced. <#> This is particularly so in the case of indoor exposure to radon and its decay products which accounts for over 30 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total radiation. </p>
 <p> <#> Radon is a natural radioactive gas that has no taste, smell or colour and requires special equipment to detect its presence. <#> It is part of the decay chain of uranium, which is widely dispersed in the earths crust, and its best known decay product, radium, which is the immediate precursor of radon. <#> Most soil and rock have traces of radon but the amount can vary in different parts of the country and at different times of the year. <#> Being a gas, it can move through porous media such as fractured rock and soil and some is exhaled at the surface. <#> When this occurs in the outdoor air it is dispersed in the atmosphere and diluted to low and harmless concentrations. <#> However, once it percolates into a enclosed space such as a building it can accumulate to dangerous levels because dispersion is restricted by the limited ventilation. <#> The concentration will depend on the radon levels in the soil gas, the construction details of the building and the available ventilation. <#> Radon may also be introduced indoors in ground water supplied from a well, or from building materials containing traces of radium, but normally the amounts from these sources are not of any consequence in this country. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 3. Entry Routes </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The increase in indoor levels of radon in recent decades is due most likely to the search for ""tighter"" building enclosures in order to reduce energy consumption. </p>
 <p> <#> These levels depend mainly on the concentration of the sub-floor soil gas and the available entry points in the ground floor area of the building. <#> As these factors usually vary from building to building each case must be considered separately. <#> The more fragmented and porous the underlying rock and soil the greater the amount of radon gas that can rise to the surface. <#> This gas can enter a building in a convective flow through cracks and holes in the floor area and any gaps around service pipes and cables (Figure 1). <#> It is usually pressure-driven due to the slightly lower indoor air pressure compared with that under the floor, a result of wind and temperature difference. <#> As might be expected, elevated levels of radon resulting from soil gas are found mainly in basements and at ground floor levels. <#> Also, radon gas is nine times heavier than air, and therefore tends to remain close to the ground. <#> Radon is not normally a problem in high rise buildings and if an elevated level is found it is likely to have been caused by emission from the building materials used. </p>
 <&> picture </&>
 <h> <bold> <#> 4. Lung Cancer </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The reason for concern about radon is its association with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. <#> Radon being radioactive disintegrates and gives off decay products known as daughters or progeny which are also radioactive. <#> These are minute particles which when released in the air may be inhaled and deposited in the lungs. <#> As they in turn decay they give a radiation dose to the lung tissues which may eventually cause lung cancer. <#> The risk is related to the level and length of exposure and is normally considered as a lifetime risk. <#> While few people these days spend a lifetime in the same house it would be foolish to ignore the risk completely and for some, the predictions over a lifetime are likely to be significant. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 5. Occurrence in Ireland </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Radioactivity in air resulting from radon is measured in becquerel per cubic metre (Bq/m3). <#> This unit of measurement means that radon is present at a concentration that emits one particle of radiation per second in a cubic metre of air. <#> A survey carried out by Dr. J.P. McLaughlin of University College Dublin of a random sample of approximately 1300 houses in the State shows a median level of indoor radon of about 35 Bq/m3 throughout the country. </p>
 <p> <#> <*> asterisk </*> The Editor wishes to apologise sincerely to Mr Connell for allowing the gremlins to wreak havoc with his excellent article when first published in the August/September issue. </p>
 <p> <#> However, levels in excess of 400 Bq/m3 were found in 1.5 <*> per cent sign </*> of cases with individual peaks rising as high as 1700 Bq/m3. <#> Most of these were located in parts of counties Clare, Galway, Mayo and Cork, but even in these counties the vast majority of the sample houses had a low radon level. <#> A more recent survey of over 500 houses in some western countries was carried out by the Nuclear Energy Board and U.C.D. to identify the distribution of elevated concentration in these areas. <#> The results indicate that about 2.8 <*> per cent sign </*> had radon levels above 400 Bq/m3 and that 9.4 <*> per cent sign </*> were above 200 Bq/m3. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 6. Reference Level </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Having a screening measurement carried out is the only way of knowing if a house has a radon problem. <#> A recommended Reference Level for Ireland has been set by the Government at 200 Bq/m3 for the annual average radon gas concentration in an existing home. <#> Above this level action should be taken to reduce it. <#> The level of 200 Bq/m3 is also intended to apply to all future houses which ideally should be constructed so that radon concentrations are as low as reasonably practicable and be at least below this level. <#> In existing houses, for levels up to 500 Bq/m3 it would be desirable to take action within a few years and where levels are over 1000 Bq/m3, within a year or so. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 7. Risks </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> For most people, the risk of developing lung cancer from radon is insignificant compared with other everyday risks. <#> Nevertheless, despite the lack of complete agreement among experts on the precise risk, it has been calculated that exposure to the Reference Level of an annual average of 200 Bq/m3 corresponds to a lifetime risk of lung cancer of about 2.5 <*> per cent sign </*>. <#> The normal lifetime risk of contracting lung cancer in Ireland is about 3 <*> per cent sign </*>. </p>
 <p> <#> International estimates now suggest that between 5 <*> per cent sign </*> and 10 <*> per cent sign </*> of lung cancer deaths may be caused by indoor radon exposure. <#> There is also strong evidence which indicates a much higher risk from radon for cigarette smokers <}> <-> that </-> <+> than </+> </}> for non-smokers. <#> The National Radiological Protection Board in the U.K. in a 1990 publication puts this risk at 10 times that for non-smokers at all levels of exposure. <#> This arises from a synergistic or multiplicative interaction of both carcinogens, which means that the combined effect exceeds the sum of the two effects taken independently. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 8. Methods of Detection </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The two most common devices used for measuring indoor radon concentrations are the alpha track detector and the charcoal canister. <#> The charcoal canister is a small container of activated carbon which absorbs radon. <#> It is exposed in a living area for about a week and then sent to a laboratory for analysis. <#> The alpha track gives a more accurate reading of the average exposure but must be left in place for a longer period, usually three months, to cover the widely fluctuating daily and seasonal variations. <#> The detector consists of a small container which allows the alpha particles released by the radon to come in contact inside the container with a small piece of special plastic in which tracks are formed by the radiation striking it. <#> After exposure for the recommended time it is also sent to a laboratory for analysis. <#> The <}> <-> intial </-> <+> initial </+> </}> screening measurement may indicate that there is no need for further action, but in some cases it may be necessary to take measurements over a longer period to get a more accurate estimate of the average level. <#> There are other techniques requiring operation by trained personnel which can be used to give ""instant"" reading, but they are more expensive and, due to the normal variation in concentrations over a short period of time, would be certainly less reliable in determining the average radon level. </p>
 <p> <#> It is possible to take radon measurements in the ground on a prospective building site, but the results may be of limited value. <#> Alfa track detectors may be buried in holes about 600mm deep and recovered after exposure for one week. <#> If high readings are found there is no doubt about the need for preventative measures. <#> Low readings in the ground, however, may not be taken as a guarantee of low concentrations inside a future building on the site, as any excavation necessary during construction may increase the release of soil gas which could result in high indoor concentrations. <#> After construction it would probably be necessary to have indoor measurements taken in both cases to find out the actual level inside the building. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 9. Prediction of Concentration </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> One of the difficulties at present with the occurrence of radon gas is that no reliable method has been found for identifying the geographical areas most at risk. <#> There is evidence linking high radon levels with underlying areas of uranium-bearing granite, shales, phosphate and certain sandstones, but this pattern is not entirely reliable which makes it difficult to prepare maps predicting areas of high concentrations based on geographical data. <#> As an alternative, national surveys based on map grids are extremely expensive and lengthy exercises and result in only very general indications due to the variations in radon concentrations that may occur within small areas. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Complexity of Adaptation in Real-World Case-Based Reasoning Systems </bold> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> 1 Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a reasoning method that uses experiential knowledge, in the form of cases, to solve problems. <#> When faced with a new problem a CBR system will retrieve a case that is similar, and, if necessary, adapt it to provide the desired solution. <#> Its current popularity as a problem solving paradigm is representative of the shift that has occurred in automated problem solving research; researchers are beginning to move from simple, ""toy"" domains to complex, real world domains. <#> With this move has come a recognition of the many inadequacies of traditional problem solving approaches, and assumptions previously deemed reasonable have proved invalid in complex, dynamic real world domains. <#> Case-based reasoning methods have proved useful in dealing with many of these problems and have had considerable initial success in real world problem solving endeavours.</p>
 <p> <#> Researchers have organised problem solving into three main classes. <#> In order of increasing complexity, these are: <it> simple, routine, </it> and <it> innovative </it>. <#> Simple problem solving activities are characterised by domains whose simplicity facilitate solution generation in a fairly straightforward fashion; there is a relatively direct inference path from problem specification to problem solution. <#> With routine problem solving, domains are more complex and often incomplete, problem specifications are conceptually quite distant from their solutions, and additional computational expense is incurred due to conflicts between dependent domain objects. <#> The most difficult activity, innovative problem solving, is identified by patchy domain models, intricate solution paths through the problem-space, and a considerable amount of backtracking due to interaction problems. </p>
 <p> <#> The aim of this paper is to characterise the relationship between case-based reasoning and problem solving tasks of differing complexity. <#> This relationship is discussed in detail in the next sections. <#> Sections three, four and five solidify this discussion by introducing three real CBR systems concerned with simple, routine, and innovative problem solving. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 2 Problem Solving Complexity and CBR </bold> <h>
 <p> <#> Our perspective on problem solving is concerned with search-based problem solving techniques. <#> Such problem solvers search a space of ""world models"" or ""problem states"" (the problem-space) to find one in which all the problem goals have been achieved (the goal state). <#> Search proceeds through the problem-space by the application of state-transforming operators. <#> The task of the problem solver is then to find some sequence of operators that transform the initial state into the goal state. <#> The complexity and cost of automated problem solving is well studied and there are many ways that it can be estimated. <#> The classic measure is the amount of search which has to be carried out in developing a solution to a problem. </p>
 <p> <#> Essentially, there are two search related problems associated with conventional problem solving methods. <#> The first, which we term the <it> operator chaining problem </it> <sp> 1 </sp>, is basically the problem of searching forward through the problem-space to find the appropriate sequence (chain) of operators with which to solve the target problem. <#> Relieving this problem has been (and still is) the objective of much research and has resulted in a range of relatively successful techniques (e.g. heuristic search, hierarchical planning, least commitment strategy, goal regression etc. ). <#> Further computational complexity arises from the <it> operator conflict problem </it> <sp> 2 </sp>. <#> As a planner interacts with its domain it receives a stream of conjunctive goals. <#> Were these goals independent of one another the cost of problem solving would be linear with the number of goals. <#> The reality is somewhat different. <#> Operator conflicts can result in unfavourable interactions between goals. <#> Under such conditions the problem solver must backtrack over earlier work in order to plan a new solution which avoids these interactions. <#> If somehow the problem solver could learn specific sequences of actions that overcome interaction problems in certain situations, the cost per goal could be reduced in the long run. </p>
 <p> <#> Case-based reasoning methods attempt to address both of these problems. <#> By constraining the problem-space search, it reduces the operator chaining problem; the retrieval of a similar case constitutes a considerable 'jump' into the problem space thereby eliminating many potential routes from the search. <#> Furthermore, CBR is potentially a more efficient constraint method than conventional approaches (e.g. heuristic evaluation etc.) whose scope is more local, pertaining to individual problem space states rather than whole areas. <#> Backtracking due to bad interactions may also be avoided, thereby relieving the operator conflict problem. <#> Effectively, cases can be viewed as 'canned' solutions where operator conflicts have been resolved in certain well defined situations As long as the retrieved case is sufficiently similar to the target relatively few conflicts should arise due to modifications made during adaptation. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> An Overview of CBR </bold> </h> <p> <#> In CBR, problem solving knowledge is characterised as a set of episodes each representing the solution to a specific problem situation. <#> A new problem (the <it> target </it>) is solved by retrieving a similar episode (<it> base case </it>) from memory, and its solution is then modified to conform with the target situation. <#> Cases are represented by features and relationships and case retrieval depends on matching these case representations. <#> It can be seen from the following description of the stages in CBR that the retrieval stages is a two stage process:- </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Representation:</bold> </h>: <#> Cases are represented by features and operators (relationships). <#> The features may be surface or abstract features and typically the more predictive features will be selected for indexing. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Base Filtering </bold> </h> : <#> A small number of candidate episodes which are considered contextually similar to the target situation are selected from the case base. <#> The case base will often be organised as a discrimination network (D-net) to facilitate this. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Case Selection / Mapping </bold> </h>: <#> This second stage will select a case from this candidate set based on a more detailed comparison of the cases. <#> A mapping between the base and target cases may also be produced at this stage. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Adaptation </bold> </h> : <#> Once the best case from the case base has been selected it must be adapted to fit the problem in hand. <#> In the simplest situations, for instance diagnosis, this adaptation may be trivial and the base case may apply without modification. <#> Adaptation may be very complex in more difficult problem domains, e.g. non routine design. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> 2.2 A CBR Perspective on Complexity </bold> </h> <#> Earlier we introduced the notion of a number of types of problem solving: simple, routine, and innovative. <#> In fact, we can view these as a continuum of problem solving tasks (Figure 1) organised in terms of computational complexity. <#> As illustrated, the relative contribution of the operator chaining and operator conflict problems varies across this continuum. <#> Due to the simplicity of their domains, simple problem solving tasks incur the bulk of their cost from the operator chaining problem; the lack of domain complexity leads to few conflicts so little time is spent backtracking. <#> At the other end of the continuum, the complexity of the domains of innovative problem solving tasks results in the operator conflict problem being very prominent (and expensive to resolve), with proportionately less time spent on the operator chaining problem. </p>
 <%> Figure 1 </%>
 <p> <#> The basic tenet of CBR is that, rather than solve a problem from first principles, it may be easier to retrieve a similar problem and transform the solution to that problem. <#> In Figure 2 we attempt to illustrate these trade-offs graphically. <#> SP' represents the specification for a new problem and SL' is the solution to that problem. <#> FP' represents the search process that establishes this solution from first principles - the task we wish to avoid. <#> A CBR solution is worthwhile if the retrieval task R, and the adaptation task A are simpler than FP'.</p>
 <&> Figure 2 </&>
 <p> <#> In the later sections of this paper we will examine three CBR systems that differ in the complexity of the transformation task A:- </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Substitution Adaptation: </bold> </h> : <#> This is the simplest type of adaptation and merely involved substituting some of the parameters in the solution. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> Transformational Adaptation: </bold> </h> : <#> This adaptation is more complex and will involve structural changes to the solution.</p>
 <p> <h> <bold> Generative Adaptation: </bold> </h>: <#> This is the most complex adaptation and is not perfectly represented by the diagram. <#> The adaptation process involves a rework of the reasoning process FP in the context of the new problem situation represented by SP'.</p>
 <p> <#> From a case-based reasoning perspective there is a relationship between the complexity of the problem solving task and the complexity of the CBR adaptation process. <#> CBR systems concerned with simple problem solving tasks will typically require simple, substitutional adaptation; the retrieved case will typically be very close to the target and consequently will require only very basic substitutive adaptation, with little or no chance of bad interactions occurring. <#> With routine problem solving tasks, the retrieved case, while being similar to the target, will probably require substantial modification possibly changing some structural elements of the retrieved solution (transformational adaptation), and innovative problem solving tasks extensive modifications are necessary during adaptation so interactions are unavoidable and difficult to resolve. <#> To accommodate this adaptation complexity it is generally necessary to augment cases with detailed knowledge such as the reasoning trace structures of Carbonell 's Derivational Analogy. </p>

 <p> <#> Simple problem solving tasks are characterised by well-defined domain models, and a relatively direct inference path from problem specification to problem solution. <#> Case-based reasoning methods are particularly well suited to such tasks as there is often a rich set of cases to draw upon during problem solving. <#> The retrieved case is typically very similar to the target problem and consequently the adaptation problem is relatively uncomplicated; in general modifying the attributes of solution elements will suffice without the need to change the overall solution structure. </p>
 <&> Figure 3 </&>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> 3.1 A Brief Overview of Rachman </bold> </h> <#> Figure 3 shows two example cases from a case-based system called Rachman that can predict the selling value of a house given some details about it. <#> The system contains a large case base of houses and their selling prices and, given a house description, it will retrieve a case or a set of cases describing similar houses and their selling prices. <#> These prices can be adjusted depending on differences between the target and base cases to estimate the price of the target house. <#> This system is comparatively straightforward but is equivalent to a host of potential CBR applications, for example loan risk assessment and help-desk assistants. <#> The complexity of this problem is greatly reduced by having a well populated case base, so that good matches can be found and the required adaptation is not difficult.</p>
 <p> <#> The cases are divided into two sets of features, the index features and the internal features. <#> The index features are the most strongly predictive features and form the basis for the D-Net (Figure 4). <#> The main problem with the D-Net approach is that it forces a strict ordering of the index features, in this example the cases might be organised first under location, then number of bedrooms, etc. <#> However, different users may have different priorities; some, for instance, might consider the number of bedrooms to be more important than location. <#> In addition, it will not be possible to retrieve matches for cases that have missing features as the retrieval process will not be able to search below the level of that feature in the network.</p>
 <p> <#> These problems are largely solved by introducing redundancy into the D-Net. <#> This means that the network supports alternative orderings on the index features (see Figure 4). <#> The extent to which redundancy can be introduced into the network is limited because the size of the network grows in proportion to the number of orderings supported. <#> Retrieval in Rachman returns clusters of cases and the cases are ranked according to their frequency of occurrence in these clusters. </p>
 <&> Figure 4 </&>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> 3.2 Substitutional Adaptation in Rachman </bold> </h> <#> It is assumed with this system that the case base is well populated so that near or exact matches can be found. <#> This means that the adaptation is comparatively straightforward using substitution specialists that adjust the price based on differences between the base and target cases. <#> For instance a substitution specialist may add or remove the value of having a conservatory. <#> The important point is that the effect of this adjustment is quite local and does not cause complex interactions.</p>
 <h> <bold> <#> D&/ej&\a Vu: Transformational Adaptation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In a CBR system for routine problem solving, retrieved cases, while being comparatively similar to the target, will probably require substantial structural modification. <#> Consequently a limited opportunity exists for bad interactions to occur. <#> Carbonell (Carbonell, 1983) characterises such problem solvers as belonging to the realm of <it> <}> <-> Tranformational </-> <+> Transformational </+> </}> Analogy </it>. <#> Essentially, the adaptation stage can be considered as a solution transformation problem. <#> Finding the appropriate transformation is itself a problem-solving process, but in a different problem space. <#> The states of this transformation-space (T-space) are problem solutions, as opposed to solution states. <#> The transformation-space operators (T-operators) are atomic solution transformation operators (e.g., Substitute Solution Step, Delete Solution Step, Insert Solution Step, Reorder Solution Steps). <#> And the job of adaptation is to find the appropriate sequence of T-operators which will transform the retrieved solution into the desired target solution (See Figure 5). </p>

 <p> <#> Clara Bog is in State ownership by this State Body so the proposed interpretative centre will be overseen by them. <#> They are now awaiting E.C. structural funds to continue with their plans. </p>
 <p> <#> Speaking at a public meeting in the Parochial Hall on Tuesday, 3rd September 1991, where there were a large number of profile people from the tourism and scientific community in both Ireland and the Netherlands, Mr. Eamonn Grennan, an agriculturalist with the National Parks and Wildlife Service for O.P., pledged that the interpretative and study centre would be established in Clara when the funds are available. <#> He added that there was a tremendous amount of goodwill towards the setting up of a centre by the local people, and he believed that this was the first step towards putting Clara on the map as far as tourist facilities were concerned. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Such a centre would be built when the monies become available, but there is a commitment for this centre to go ahead."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> The W.S. are presently actively pursuing the matter of acquiring a site and hope to come to a decision very shortly. <#> When the site has been acquired, the commitment for the centre will be firmer still, Mr. Grennan added: </p>
 <p> <#> As early as May 1990, Ms. Noreen O'Keeffe of the Wildlife Service told ""The Offaly Independent"" that the interpretative centre would be located in the town of Clara and it would not be a bog location. <#> At this time, they hoped that progress would be made before the end of the year. <#> However, due to governmental cutbacks, the plans are still suspended. <#> The Wildlife Service hope that when the centre is built it would act as a focus for peatland conservation, promoting an awareness of the great botanical and zoological heritage of Irish bogs, particularly Clara Bog. <#> <}> <-> The </-> <+> They </+> </}> hope to provide an audio-visual display in the centre also. </p>
 <p> <#> A board walk 1,200m in length is to be erected at the bog in the very near future. <#> The idea was mooted by Mr. Grennan and T. Dolan as a firm step towards the provision of an interpretative centre. <#> Offaly Co. Council are also involved in arranging a location for the centre at Clara. <#> They will incorporate the W.S. 's plans into their Development Plan for Co. Offaly. </p>
 <h> <bold> <ul> <#> (b) The Irish Wildlife Federation (I.W.F.) </bold> </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> This organisation was involved in saving Clara Bog from development by Bord na Mona in 1986. <#> As part of Ireland 's contribution to the European Environmental Bureau 's E.Y.E. Projects, the I.W.F. organised a National Conservation workday on the bog in August 1987 and the group 's President, Fergus O'Gorman, called on all members to come and help ""Groundwork"" with the drain filling. <#> Over 150 came from all over the country. <#> Their aims according to their President is: </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""To conserve Irish Wildlife, e.g., Clara Bog by developing public awareness, especially amongst young people through educational programmes."" </quote> </p>
 <h> <bold> <ul> <#> (c) The Irish Peatland Conservation council (I.I.C.C.) </bold> </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> The I.P.C.C. was established in 1982 during the National Bog Conservation week, held by An Taisce. <#> The members of the organisation are persons from different institutes and State bodies. <#> They promote a peatland conservation programme in Ireland and encourage the preservation of a representative series Irish peatlands. <#> They also encourage State and Semi-State organisations involved in peatland development to acknowledge the conservation and amenity of such ecosystems. <#> The committee have included Clara Bog in their List of International Importance, and applied to the E.C. for funds to secure the complete preservation of Clara Bog. <#> A fund of <*> pound sign </*> 650,000 per year was provided for acquisition of reserves under the Wildlife Act. </p>
 <p> <#> They support the idea of an interpretative centre depending on the location.</p>
 <h> <bold> <ul> <#> (d) The Dutch/Irish Project on Clara Bog </bold> </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> This project and the nature of the research is discussed in Section 5.4. (and will end in 1992). <#> Dr. Matthijs Schouten is a renowned environmentalist with the Dutch contingent and has made Ireland his second home. <#> Mr. Eric Ch. Niehe, Dutch Ambassador to Ireland also addressed the meeting in Clara last September. <#> They both made some interesting points and observations at the meeting of which I have included the main points. </p>
 <p> <#> Mr. Niehe talked about the great concern of some Dutch people for the conservation of Irish bogland, which is long since eaten away in Holland. <#> They had actually purchased tracts of Irish bogland in the hope of preserving it. <#> In an article in ""The Offaly Independent"" (Date: 16th September 1991) he says: </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Bogs are not of interest only to peat diggers, but to scientists, tourists, even ambassadors and Presidents. <#> (President Hillary visited the bog last year)."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> His Dutch companion, Dr. Schouten is founding chairman of the Dutch Foundation for the Conservation of Bogs and is a familiar figure in Clara, having first put the bog on the agenda for preservation. <#> He gave a comprehensive exposition on the concept of what has now become ""Green Tourism"" or ""Eco-tourism"". <#> Assets in green tourism, he noted, were usually not easily accessible, unlike much visited sites, e.g., Westminster, Acropolis, etc., which were centrally located because of their function. <#> Also, places in the green tourism sector were not self explanatory, he said: </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""If you dump a tourist in the bog firstly, he does not know where to go. <#> Therefore, some form of interpretation is needed."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> He went on to say that a feature of green tourism sites was their low carrier capacity. <#> Eco-tourism was only just emerging and yet damage has already been done to places like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and nature reserves near Kilimanjaro in Africa, because of an over-concentration of tourists. <#> At the same time, he stressed that he was not trying to discourage anyone in Clara promoting the bog for tourism - he was merely stating that careful planning was essential. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""The idea of a quick buck can be a catastrophe for green tourism, it 's a longterm thing."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Mr. Schouten describes four type of green tourist. <#> The first type he labelled the <quote> ""cup of tea and a snap-shot"" </quote> tourist who would travel Europe in seven days, spending only very little time in each area. <#> Secondly, there is the main grouping which he called the <quote> ""I want the experience, but with <}> <-> with </-> </}> not too much effort please"" </quote> tourists. <#> They would spend a couple of hours on a site in an organised tour, and would be reluctant even to don Wellingtons. <#> Thirdly, there is the ""explorer"" type of green tourist who would spend up to a day on a site, has a keen interest in wildlife and would walk and cycle. <#> Finally, there is the <quote> ""true tourist"" </quote> types who are amateur scientists and would spend their entire holiday on one site. </p>
 <p> <#> Dr. Schouten continues to say at this meeting, how large numbers of tourists should be handled when they come to Clara. <#> An Interpretative Centre is crucial, he says, so that visitors would know what they are seeing; otherwise there would be bad publicity for Clara in their home country. </p>
 <p> <#> Such a centre should be built away from the heart of the area of focus, perhaps in the town of Clara, so that the tourists would be ""trapped"". <#> It should also, in his opinion, feature the bog and esker and be staffed by local guides, such as those presently working for the Eiscir Riada and Clara Bog Tour Group. <#> They would guide three and four types of tourist. <#> As regards the bog itself, he suggests opening up the least vulnerable part and recommended that all visitors not be concentrated on the same spot. </p>
 <p> <#> Furthermore, the different types of tourist should not be accommodated in the same place. <#> He adds that very wide and raised walkways would protect the bog and discourage littering and could lead to an area appropriate for a snapshot. <#> The carpark would have to separate from the bog. <#> The trail should begin at the esker, he notes, continuing onto a high site suitable for a photograph and then leading onto the bog by means of walkways. </p>
 <p> <#> He also recommends a trail for cycles so that all four types could then be catered for adequately. <#> The other amenities that would follow from the centre would include the following: Bed and breakfast, plus restaurant and tearooms, a cycle rent shop and a small library. <#> He stresses that tourists would only come to Clara with good marketing, and information on the town should be sent to Irish and foreign wildlife magazines and green tour operators. <#> An annual event would also have to be held and Clara had this with its ""Queen of the Heather Festival"" which mixed education and entertainment. </p>
 <p> <#> Mr. Donal Daly is a hydro-geologist with the Irish contingent of the project. <#> He would like to see the centre located in the town of Clara for a number of reasons. <#> Worldwide, they are finding that when you locate a centre in the middle of a nature reserve, that it can be very damaging and that they are now being removed. <#> Also the question of sewage and where it will leave the bog would be a potential problem. <#> He <}> <-> believe </-> <+> believes </+> </}> that people do not want to see massive artefacts. <#> He hails Clara as:
 <quote> <#> ""One of the most important intact raised bogs in Western Europe."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> He would like to see Clara Bog as part of an overall Offaly tourist package, including the Slieve Blooms, Clonmacnoise, Mary 's Church in Pullogh and Lockes Distillery in Kilbeggan. </p>
 <h> <bold> <ul> <#> (e) The Clara Bog Development Association (C.B.D.A.) </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This community group grew out of the ""Queen of the Heather Festival"" in 1982. <#> The popularity of these trips increased with as many as 500-600 attending them over the week-end excursions. <#> One was entitled ""Clara Bog and Esker Day"". <#> In the early 1980's, they lobbied to save the bog and succeeded in forcing the State to buy the bog. <#> The work of the C.B.D.A. received recognition on several occasions in the last two years. <#> Firstly, they were short listed in the Ford European Conservation Awards. <#> Then, in February 1991, the Bank of Ireland Local Hero Awards paid tribute to their efforts to increase public awareness about Clara Bog. <#> They were given <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 by the Department of the Environment for this and the money is going towards building the board-walk over the bog. </p>
 <p> <#> Mr. Michael Pettit and Tommy Dolan are two prominent members of the C.B.D.A. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Our observations are that while it is advisable to bring people onto the bog, it is not advisable to damage it in any way."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Both members agree that local unemployment in the town is very high. <#> All businesses including their own would be grateful for increased profit and security in the future. <#> The chemist and bar/grocery shops owned by both, as well as the bakery/coffee shop on the main street are likely to benefit if the centre were to be located in the town. <#> The local concern about the bog 's future has been noticeable especially with increased media coverage over the last 5 years. <#> This concern is reflected in the large attendance numbers at the meetings and the amount of local involvement in the annual events to encourage people to Clara. </p>
 <h><bold> <ul> <#> (f) Bord F&/ailte </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Mr. Martin Dully is Chief Executive with Bord F&/ailte. <#> He made some comments at the meeting last September in Clara, of which I will now include. <#> Firstly, he detailed the need to protect Clara Bog and esker and at the same time promoting it for tourism. <#> He said that there was a delicate balance between a growing economy, the need for jobs and the need to share the beauty of Ireland with our European partners and others, and the need to protect the bog from <quote> ""tourism of a vandalistic nature"". </quote> <#> Mr. Dully, a native of Athlone reflected in how a terrain which had formerly been perceived as <quote> ""inflicted"" </quote> on the people, had now assumed such importance. <#> In an article in ""The Offaly Independent"" (9/9/91) he says:
 <quote> <#> ""None of us had the inspiration, or education, or insight, to see bogs as a botanist 's heaven. <#> The like of David Bellamy and Dr. Schouten highlighted it for the Irish."" </quote> </p>

 <h> <ul> <#> CHAPTER 111 </ul> </h>
 <h> <ul> <#> PART-TIME FARMING </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> Part-time farming is a term which is very hard to get an adequate definition for. <#> Official figures in recording part-time farmers underestimate the amount that there are. </p>
 <#> There are two main ways to look at the term;
 <#> (1) to do with source of income <#> (2) to do with amount of labour time
 <p> <#> The established full working year on a farm is 275 days. <#> Irish figures for part-time farming tend to be based on labour and they take into account any adult worker on the farm, not just the owner-occupier. <#> This leads to confusion between part-time farmers and part-time farms. </p>
 <p> <#> In Ireland a farm is only seen to be a part-time farm for official <}> <-> stataistics </-> <+> statistics </+> </}> if it is the farmer who works for a certain period off the farm. <#> But if the wife works off the farm then it is not seen as a part-time farm. </p>
 <p> <#> Up to the mid 1980's part-time farming wasn't really important in Ireland. <#> But since 1985 with the introduction of C.A.P. part-time farming has been a transitional Phenomenon in Ireland and that it arose because of the process of commercialisation in Ireland. <#> Before this we had the idea of full Time farms. <#> These farms had enough means by itself to <}> <-> subtain </-> <+> sustain </+> </}> the household. <#> It had enough labour to occupy the owner and his sons as well. <#> This ideal changed with commercialisation of agriculture and in the increased competition and struggles in farming. </p>
 <p> <#> Research in America says that it has discovered four distinct groups of farmers (some overlap).
 <#> 1. People (hobby farmers) Ð bought into farming. <#> 2. Farmers retired and no direct heir-running down enterprise. <#> 3. Aspiring Ð route into eventual full Time farming. <#> 4. Chronic part-time Ð perhaps once hoped to become full time farmers and have given up. <#> Also may be people who have access to work both on the farm and off it and they want to keep it this way. </p>
 <p> <#> The farmers in the Cooley Peninsula mainly fit into category four now. <#> Many of them have access to work both on and off the farm. <#> But this will be discussed in detail later on. </p>
 <p> <#> It has been seen that the size of the farm in relation to part time farming is related to the type of the other occupation. <#> For example the larger the farm the less likely that the owner 's (other job) would be that of an employee. <#> It has been found that two thirds were employers or self employed. </p>
 <p> <#> In Part Time farming there is the case that where one member leaves the farm then there is an increase in work for the other workers. <#> The effect of this may mean a change in the line of work the farmer was engaged in. <#> But this does not necessarily mean a decrease in farm productivity. <#> Also the income from the off farm work may in many cases be ploughed back into the farm, so as to improve the farm. <#> Much of the off the farm work helps to maintain the farm. </p>
 <p> <#> Part time farming has in the past meant that a farmer devoted some time often on a seasonal basis to off farm work. <#> The percentage of part time farmers will increase as the country becomes more industrialized with an increase in the percentage of farm land owned by part time <}> <-> farmer 's. </-> <+> farmers. </+> </}> </p>
 <&> table inserted </&>
 <p> <#> This shows that many farmers in Louth work off the farm for a period of time during the year. <#> These figures will have increased over the past 14 years. <#> There would be an increase in part-time farmers. <#> In the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy there is an increase in the proportion of part time farmers, whether they are farmers who supplement farm earnings with off farm employment or non farmers who buy land. </p>
 <p> <#> Rural Industrialisation has had a great impact on farming. <#> It has been seen to be the way of providing a new source of work, and income and also to enable farmers to farm more effectively and increase their farm output. <#> Industrial earnings tend to be <}> <-> plouged </-> <+> ploughed </+> </}> back into the farm. <#> The farmer is able to improve his equipment and his facilities which in turn enables him to improve the farm. </p>
 <p> <#> The impact of part-time farming can be seen in the Cooley Peninsula. <#> Many of the farmers here have branched into another activity in order to improve their standards of living. <#> But most of the extra income that they earn is ploughed back into the farm in order to make the farm more productive and better able to withstand the pressure and competition from within the farming community as a whole. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> AGRICULTURAL POLICY </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> In the mid 1980's the European Community 's agricultural Policy was in need of change. <#> This policy is know as C.A.P. or Common <}> <-> Agricultureal </-> <+> Agricultural </+> </}> Policy. <#> The reason for change was partly because of the costs of marketing, but also the extent of surplus and costs in trying to manage these was another consideration. </p>
 <p> <#> The food mountain of the E.E.C. were causing major problems. <#> In the past the E.E.C. controlled these food mountains by adding new international markets to the E.E.C. <#> But these markets were no longer available to the E.C. BECAUSE THEY WERE OVER SATURATED. </p>
 <p> <#> For the first time there were many strong pressure groups outside the agricultural sector. <#> The E.E.C. were planning for 1992, and the idea of free trade. <#> This was another reason why the C.A.P. had to be changed. </p>
 <p> <#> In 1985 the problem of food mountains was eased slightly as butter was sold to Russia and there was new meat markets in the East 1/2 </p>
 <p> <#> The C.A.P. change was brought about by pressure from America through the G.A.T.T. talks. <#> There has been more vocal <}> <-> critizm </-> <+> criticism </+> </}> in the last couple of years particularly in the way the C.A.P. preferred the larger producers than the smaller ones. <#> Many small farmers have been forced out of farming. <#> This factor in farming can be clearly seen in the Cooley Peninsula as now there are little or no small farmers in the commercial market. <#> All the larger farmers in the area have either <}> <-> bouhj </-> <+> bought </+> </}> the land of the small farmers or are renting the land. </p>
 <p> <#> There has been massive technological changes in agriculture. <#> These changes are related to overall state strategies in the managing of agriculture. <#> The technological change can be seen in the Cooley Peninsula in many ways. <#> One can see that most of the farmers have most farm machinery available to them. <#> Every one of the farmers in the survey I conducted had more than one tractor and a combine <}> <-> harvestor. </-> <+> harvester. </+> </}> <#> Many of them had ploughs, sowers, balers etc. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> PART-TIME FARMING ACTIVITIES IN THE COOLEY PENINSULA </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> The Peninsula can become the 'gem' of Europe, if the potential for growth in <}> <-> manay </-> <+> many </+> </}> areas can be harnessed into one all <}> <-> embracomg </-> <+> embracing </+> </}> programme and <}> <-> deceiving </-> <+> receiving </+> </}> adequate resources through the structural funds. </p>
 <p> <#> The growth area include;
 <#> (1) Agriculture <#> (2) Horticulture <#> (3) Tourism <#> (4) Forestry <#> (5) Transport and Storage <#> (6) Fishing <#> (7) Food Industry </p>
 <p> <#> It is clear when studying the area that the farmers are changing their agricultural practices. <#> They are specialising in many areas and many are involved in part-time activities. <#> This has happened because farming has now become so competitive that farmers need to change their strategies in order to survive. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> AGRICULTURE </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> Agriculture in the area can be greatly improved. <#> Over the last two decades new strains of grain which are better adapted to the soils of the area have been bred. <#> These grains are now being used in the area so crop yields are now much higher. <#> New and improved sprays and fertilisers are being manufactured every few years and these are improving the yields of crops significantly. <#> New breeds of cattle and Sheep are being discovered and being used. <#> These new cattle and sheep are better able to withstand diseases </p>
 <&> table </&>
 <p> <#> As can be seen from this table farmers are realising the potential that sheep have in the area. <#> The overall number of sheep in the area has increased quite dramatically in the space of three years i.e. from 30,450 in 1986 to 62,000 in 1989. <#> Also the number of flock owners has increased. <#> The hilly areas in Cooley are very suitable for sheep. </p>
 <&> table </&>
 <p> <#> These numbers have increased since <}> <-> them. </-> <+> then. </+> </}> <#> A large number of the sheep owners are in the Cooley peninsula. <#> This is because the area is suitable for sheep rearing. <#> But this potential can be increased even further in the future. <#> The sheep farmers in the area have a group known as the Sheep Farmers Association and this group is very important in the managing of sheep. <#> The importance of groups in farming has been discussed in the literary section. </p>
 <p> <#> In the Cooley Peninsula there is a livestock premium and headage scheme in operation. <#> This is important to the farmers in the area. <#> All the sheep and cattle farmers have to be registered herd owners of 18 years of age and over. <#> If the <}> <-> ares </-> <+> area </+> </}> is disadvantaged then the farmer will receive higher grants from the government. <#> The Cooley area has some disadvantaged areas i.e. the hills and the mountains so they receive slightly over the average grant for cattle. <#> Ewe premiums are the same all over the country and this is dependant on the difference between reference price and average market price for a marketing year. <#> In 1991 lowland premium was expected to be <*> pound sign </*> 20/ewe with <*> pound sign </*> 3.45 extra in severely handicapped areas. </p>
 <p> <#> As can be seen agriculture is widely developed in the area but the potential for better development is there. <#> Government grants can also help the area. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> HORTICULTURE </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> Nationally we imported 48 million pounds worth of Horticultural produce in 1987. <#> In the seven years between 1978 and 1985, the import of apples rose by 20,000 tonnes, onions by 9,000 tonnes and tomatoes by 8,000 tonnes. <#> If natural gas was made available to Irish growers at the price available to Dutch growers in Holland, tomato production could be expanded to reduce the level of imports. <#> With proper investment, we could grow the major share of the 17 million worth of imported apples. <#> Fashionable vegetables could be produced at home. </p>
 <p> <#> An example of what can be done when the right tactics are adopted is very evident in Mushroom growing. <#> Fresh mushrooms to the value of 7 million pounds were exported in 1985, as a result in the establishment of growing centres and <}> <-> satelite </-> <+> satellite </+> </}> growers based on the family unit. <#> This factor can be seen in the Cooley Peninsula. <#> There are two major mushroom growers in the area. <#> These growers received government grants to set up their industry and now they are very successful. <#> They employ many local people and they export to markets both at home and abroad. </p>
 <p> <#> This is an example of a part-time activity which a farmer may go into. <#> The two mushroom industry owners are both ordinary farmers as well. <#> One of them is a sheep farmer with a small amount of tillage activities and the other one is a tillage farmer. </p>
 <p> <#> In the Cooley Peninsula there is an ever-increasing number interested in all areas of horticulture production. <#> The area offers a fruitful and productive zone for horticultural training and for field trials on family farms. </p>
 <p> <#> If horticultural production is to flourish, then those involved must be highly skilled, must co-operate with each other, must find better and more economic methods of production and above all must be aware of consumer needs. <#> This can only be achieved by proper training. <#> Teagasc provides many courses for this training in the area and over the years many more people have undergone this course and have started growing horticultural produce as a result. </p>

 <h> <#> <bold> SECOND THOUGHTS </bold> </h>
 <h> <#> <bold> Mary Ellen Synon </bold> </h>
 <h> <#> <bold> Three days of every working week the Irishman is a slave </bold> </h>
 <h> <#> <bold> Part of the population remains tax slaves, working for the benefit of the other part, who remain parasites </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> ON considering the citizens of this state, one 's mind naturally turns to thoughts of slavery. <#> Anybody who works here turns over more than half the wealth he creates to the state. </p>
 <p> <#> The term for this is taxation, but the effect is slavery: for slavery means being forced to work for the benefit of others. <#> Three days of every working week, the Irishman is a slave. <#> And a badly paid slave, too: in the 19th-century slave states of America, the typical slave field hand received about 90 <*> per cent sign </*> of the income he produced. <#> The typical Irish PAYE worker receives about half as much. </p>
 <p> <#> And who is it that is enslaving the Irishman? <#> Well, that is an interesting point. <#> Usually you would imagine that it is either the totalitarians of the right; or it is the totalitarians of the left. </p>
 <p> <#> That is the way it has been in most states with a slave economy. <#> But here we have a quirk. <#> We have left and right both working towards enslaving the population, for different reasons - or, at least, under the guise of different philosophies - but with the same end. <#> Which is no real comfort to the slave, but he might want to look up from the cotton-picking long enough to see whose hand holds the whip. </p>
 <p> <#> First, consider the totalitarians of the Irish religious right. <#> They, of course, do not believe that the citizen should work for his own benefit. <#> He must, the right say, work for glory in the next life, for the word of God, for the needy, for the benefit of his family, for the benefit of other people 's families, for poor people here, for poor people anywhere. </p>
 <p> <#> However, he must not work for his own benefit. <#> That, say the religious right, is wrong. <#> That is selfish. <#> That is also liberty, but the religious right do not work for liberty. <#> They work for the surrender of liberty. <#> They work for slavery. </p>
 <p> <#> The heartiest slave-drivers of this religious right are the priests and nuns who press the Government - in the name of 'justice': how the stomach turns - to pull more and more taxation from the working people so that idle people can have bigger welfare payments. </p>
 <p> <#> The success of this lobbying can be seen in the result. <#> Part of the population remain slaves, working for the benefit of the other part, who remain parasites. </p>
 <p> <#> Neither group has control over its money, either how it is spent or where it comes from. <#> Neither group is made up of citizens enjoying liberty. <#> But we are assured this is God 's intention: money must go where it is needed, not where it is earned. </p>
 <p> <#> The other slave-drivers of the right are those who say they work to protect the family, to protect morals, to bring God 's laws into civil legislation. </p>
 <p> <#> Now, these people are a particularly interesting set. <#> Mostly their policies are founded on utter irrationalities. <#> They do not deny that their foundation is irrational; they admit it is mystical revelation, not rational argument. </p>
 <p> <#> Yet sometimes their irrational motives bring them into rational territory. <#> And the slave ought to look up and be pleased that, if only by accident, liberty is somewhere left alive. </p>
 <p> <#> I mean in particular the question of legislation on abortion. <#> The ardent right oppose abortion, which is a rational and liberal thing to do. <#> But they oppose it for the wrong reasons. </p>
 <p> <#> Consider this. <#> The free individual lives for his own benefit. <#> He is in slavery only when he is forced to live for the benefit of others. <#> The individual - the free individual - needs no further justification to own his life than that life exists. </p>
 <p> <#> No person, however young, must die for the benefit of another - not unless he himself chooses to. <#> The pre-born child lives for his own benefit, not for the benefit of his mother. <#> The law must protect the individual 's ownership of his own life. <#> Abortion is a form of slavery taken to its most extreme. </p>
 <p> <#> So no-one 's liberty - except in the rarest of cases - is endangered by laws against abortion. <#> But the right 's warped reasoning, which by coincidence reaches the right conclusion on abortion, reaches the wrong conclusion on just about everything else. </p>
 <p> <#> Marriage without the possibility of civil divorce is slavery; restriction on the free choice of willing partners is slavery - in other words, what chaps do with chaps is not something the law should be concerned about. </p>
 <p> <#> The destruction of liberty is everywhere on the right. <#> But the horrors come when one sees there is no refuge on the left. </p>
 <p> <#> The left offer the slavery of democracy. <#> They offer the totalitarianism of 51 <*> per cent sign </*>. <#> An individual, they say, has no rights, he has only the privileges given by the majority. <#> And the majority can remove those privileges any time: all they have to do is to pile into a polling booth. <#> Well, anybody who has ever looked for virtue in a polling booth is bound to be disappointed. </p>
 <h> <bold> <quote> <#> ""To assure liberty, the aim of each moral choice must be self-interest"" </quote> </bold> </h.>
 <p> <#> The forces of the left, of course, are even more adept at looting workers ' pay packets than are the forces of the right. <#> They say any theft is moral if a majority vote for the theft. </p>
 <p> <#> They are wily, though, in the way they hide the theft. <#> Each citizen who is below what may be called the envy line - a statistic more genuine than the poverty line - is led to believe that if he allows a little theft from his own earnings, what is nicked from others and given to him will be a greater sum. </p>
 <p> <#> In other words, he will be burgled, but he will be allowed a good pile of loot from the neighbour 's house. </p>
 <p> <#> Any mug who believes his own benefit lies in stealing from others might as well climb on to the auction block and open the bidding on his own freedom. <#> For there is a web of moral choices to be made, and the wrong choices end in slavery. <#> To assure liberty, the aim of each moral choice must be self-interest. </p>
 <p> <#> A government of thievery - no matter in whose apparent interest - is against each citizen 's self-interest. <#> Each individual, to remain at liberty, must refuse to tread on the liberty of any other citizen. </p>
 <p> <#> To refuse to steal from another citizen, to refuse to control, to refuse to <it> enslave, </it> is not altruism. It is a far better thing: it is self-interest. </p>
 <p> <#> Self-interest is the powerful engine of liberty which the left hate. <#> The left say ""steal,"" they say ""take what you have not earned"", they say ""control other men 's lives with restrictions, with demands, with guilt"". </p>
 <p> <#> The individual who values liberty refuses to do all these things, not because he is protecting the liberty of others, but because he is protecting his own liberty. <#> To agree to the controls of the left is to sell yourself into slavery. </p>
 <p> <#> The alert citizen must beware how the left package their slave market: when one of the left says ""think of others"", the only rational reply can be: ""I will think of and for myself. <#> Others are capable of thinking of and for themselves"". </p>
 <p> <#> The result of relentless self-interest is a marvellous thing. <#> It is a life of independence and liberty. <#> It is a life without slaves or beggars or parasites. <#> It is a life in which the totalitarians of the left - and the right - are destroyed. </p>
 <p> <#> Yet the left say we must live for the benefit of others in the name of community and democracy; the right say we must live for the benefit of others in the name of God and charity. </p>
 <p> <#> And the really frightening thing is, the slaves have come to believe it. <#> So they have forged their own chains. </p>

 <h> <#> 17TH JULY 1996 <#> CLLR. D. MCDOWELL, T.D. <#> 107C MALAHIDE ROAD, <#> DONNYCARNEY, <#> DUBLIN 3. </h>
 <h> <#> <ul> RE: DUBLIN PORT TUNNEL (D.P.T.) </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> Dear Councillor, <#> I refer to your letter dated 21st May 1996 to the National Roads Authority, and to Mr. J. Fitzgerald, City Manager. </p>
 <p> <#> In your letter the first three paragraphs list some of the genuine concerns that residents along, and close to, the route have in relation to the scheme. <#> Both the Consultants and the project management team are fully aware of these issues and they are being fully addressed within the E. I. S. for the scheme. <#> In addition many meetings and briefings have been held with various residents ' groups and local organisations. <#> Exhibitions were held at three locations along the route during December 1995 and January 1996, with a permanent exhibition mounted in the Civic Offices since the latter date. <#> All people who attended these exhibitions were given the opportunity to comment on the proposals and to highlight their concerns, and these were considered as part of the design and E.I.S. preparation process. <#> In addition to these exhibitions, group briefings, and public meetings which were held, many individuals, representatives, associations, and interest groups contacted various personnel attached to the project seeking information or expressing their views. <#> All of these contacts were responded to, usually by written reply, giving whatever details were being sought. <#> Like all other aspects of the project, this was done in a courteous, respectful and helpful way. </p>
 <p> <#> The allegations that <quote> ""the project managers have behaved in an arrogant and unhelpful way"" </quote> is completely without foundation and is totally rejected. <#> At all times the public 's queries and concerns have been dealt with courteously and efficiently. <#> It has been our objective from the commencement of planning of this project to inform the public to the best of our abilities and also to ascertain their concerns so that the E.I.S. can be as broad and effective as possible. <#> I must note however that the ""project managers"" have had to endure abuse and invective of an extreme nature from certain parties opposed to the project. <#> The opposition in some areas is of such a hostile nature that Dublin Corporation senior personnel, and the Consultants Geoconsult - Arup, were forced to withdraw from one public meeting, such was the level of abuse that they were being subjected to. </p>
 <p> <#> Your letter also refers to the allegations of structural damage during the site investigation. <#> Representatives of Geoconsult - Arup JV and Dublin Corporation met with local residents on 4th April 1996 and proposed, on the basis of an independent opinion from Forbairt, that the same drill rig be used to generate vibrations which could be then measured and assessed at the locations of the alleged cracks. <#> This proposal was rejected by the residents which is regrettable. <#> It is the considered opinion of the technical experts in Geoconsult - Arup JV that the vibrations from the drill rig could not cause structural damage and a number of tests were carried out in other areas subsequently which confirmed their views. <#> However they are more than willing to re-check the vibrations in the contentious areas if so allowed. </p>
 <p> <#> At all stages of the project due regard is given to the legislative and statutory provisions pertaining to the scheme. <#> In particular this applies to the E.I.S. which is being prepared in full accordance with the Roads Act 1993 and the Road Regulations 1994. <#> Wide scale consultation has been carried out during the preparation of the E.I.S. as recommended in the draft E.P.A. guidelines. </p>
 <p> <#> On the second page of the letter it is stated that <quote> ""very many people have little or no confidence in the project managers or any of the Authorities."" </quote> <#> It is not accepted that this is an accurate reflection of the views of the many people concerned, but instead is the reaction from a small number of people who are vehemently opposed to the tunnel. <#> It is in this context, that the statement regarding confidence should be viewed. <#> It is a matter of concern, of course, that there is a suggestion of lack of confidence. <#> The project team and all parties associated with the planning and design of the scheme will continue to provide comprehensive information to, and meet with, local people and their representatives. <#> The modes of consultation will be reassessed to see if they can be more direct and effective and also to build up greater rapport with local groups. </p>
 <p> <#> Your letter continues on to suggest that funding should be provided to local residents ' associations, to allow them to commission independent research and advice. <#> On the basis of a Dublin Corporation management decision, this suggestion was rejected earlier in the case of one particular group who had requested funding. <#> It is considered that this was the correct decision and should continue to apply. <#> The design work that has been done, has been executed in a professional, thorough and unbiased manner, and must be supported as such. <#> Funding of separate research by opposition groups is not necessary provided that the general and technical information in the E.I.S. be made available to the various interested groups, at least for inspection, and preferably for sale of copy. </p>
 <p> <#> It is noted that under Section 50 (2) (b) of the Roads Act 1993 that the E.I.S. must contain <quote> ""the data necessary to identify and assess the main effects which the proposed road development is likely to have on the environment"". <quote> <#> The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the public can examine information that the proposing Authority has collected on the environmental effects. <#> The critical issue is that the information is made readily available to the public and Dublin Corporation will be scrupulously careful in this regard. </p>
 <p> <#> In summary there is no basis to the allegations concerning the conduct and operations of the project team. <#> In all respects, and at all stages of the project to date, the scheme has been progressed in accordance with all legal requirements and obligations, and in a proper and professional manner at all times. <#> Finally all the main environmental data collected for the E.I.S. will be made available to the public as required under the Roads Act and in fulfillment of the democratic process. </p>
 <p> <#> I trust that the above information is satisfactory. </p>
 <p> <#> Yours sincerely, <#> <bold> ROY CHAMP, <#> A/ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER. </bold> </p>

 <p> <#> Though it was in its late September glory Michael lost all interest in his garden; the falling petals stayed unswept and the flowers wilted and fell into a tangled mess. <#> Several times Rose tried to prod him towards the garden but after a short time he would just stand in it, disheartened, looking on at the disorder before moving away. <#> The girls had praised his green hands. <#> His involvement in the little garden was not strong enough to survive without their praise. </p>
 <p> <#> He had few outside interests. <#> He did not play football or any team games nor did he fish or hunt or swim. <#> Knowledge and information he was able to pick up without effort and he always came close to the top of his class without appearing to study. <#> Except for maths he showed no interest in any one subject above another and his liking for mathematics seemed to stem from the fact that it came to him so easily while others struggled. <#> With the girls gone, his main distraction and society had gone, for out of Moran 's sight he had loved to tease and play with them and they with him. <#> He was as tall at fifteen as he would ever be and though he would never have Moran 's dramatic good looks he was handsome. <#> After his sisters left, he discovered that he was attractive to women but it was to older women that he was drawn. <#> From Moran he inherited a certain contempt for women as well as a dependence on them but it did not diminish his winning ways. <#> The one drawback was his lack of money. <#> To go about with young women he needed money and Moran would not part with any. </p>
 <p> <#> He went to Rose. <#> She gave him a little money but grew alarmed when he began to come home late at night. <#> When she got out of bed, anxious to see that he was all right, she discovered that he smelled of drink. <#> At school he began to earn money by doing difficult maths exercises for slower boys. <#> Moran had been listless about the house since the girls had gone but once he discovered that Michael was coming home late at night he acted decisively. <#> Without a word of warning he bolted every door and window in the house and waited up. </p>
 <p> <#> When he heard the latch of the back door being raised, he was dozing in darkness. <#> Then he heard various windows being tried. <#> Softly he went to the back door and drew the bolt and as soon as he heard returning footsteps he opened the door. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'This is a nice hour,' </quote> he said.
 <quote> <#> 'I was in town. <#> I couldn't get a lift back. <#> I had to walk.' </quote>
 <quote> <#> 'What were you doing in town?' </quote>
 <quote> <#> 'There was a dance.' </quote>
 <quote> <#> 'Did you ask to go to the dance?' </quote>
 <quote> <#> 'No.' </quote>
 <quote> <#> 'No <it> what </it> ? <#> No, pig!' </quote>
 <quote> <#> 'No, Daddy.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Moran beckoned him to come in and as he was passing him in the narrow hallway he seized him and struck him violently about the head. <quote> <#> 'I 'll teach you to come in at this hour! <#> I 'll teach you to go places without asking! <#> There must have been drink at this hooley as well!' </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Sheltered by his sisters, Michael was unused to any blows and angrily cried out as soon as he was struck. <#> There would have been a violent struggle but for Rose 's appearance. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'What an hour to come in at, Michael! <#> You have Daddy up worried about you the whole night.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'I couldn't get a lift. <#> He hit me,' </quote> the boy cried. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'You haven't seen the end of this by half. <#> I 'll teach you one good lesson. <#> Nobody 's coming into this house at any old hour of the night they like while I 'm in charge here.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Everybody 's tired now. <#> We 'll get to bed. <#> Anything that has to get gone into can be gone into in the morning,' </quote> Rose said. </p>
 <p> <#> Moran glared at her. <#> He seemed about to brush her out of the way to seize the boy but drew back. <quote> <#> 'You can thank your lucky stars the woman 's here.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'He hit me,' </quote> the boy sobbed. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'And I 'll damn well show you what it is to be hit the next time you come into the house at this hour. <#> You 're not going to do anything you like while I 'm here.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'I 'll go away,' </quote> the boy shouted self-pityingly. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Everybody 's tired. <#> Look at the time it is. <#> You can't be coming in at this time. <#> You had poor Daddy and everybody else worried to death about you,' </quote> Rose scolded and managed to shepherd both men to their rooms without further trouble. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'I 'll see that gentleman in the morning,' </quote> Moran warned. <quote> <#> 'He needn't think he 's getting away with anything in this house.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Rose got him away to school early in the morning but it was only a postponement. <#> During the weekend Michael had the good sense to stay well in the background and Mona and Sheila came from Dublin for the weekend, which postponed any confrontation further still. <#> Moran was so taken up with the girls and their life in Dublin that he hardly noticed him. </p>
 <p> <#> These visits of his daughters from London and Dublin were to flow like relief through the house. <#> They brought distraction, something to look forward to, something to mull over after they had gone. <#> Above all they brought the bracing breath of the outside, an outside Moran refused to accept unless it came from the family. <#> Without it there would have been an ingrown wilting. <#> For the girls the regular comings and goings restored their superior sense of self, a superiority they had received intact from Moran and which was little acknowledged by the wide world in which they had to work and live. <#> That unexamined notion of superiority was often badly shaken and in need of restoration each time they came home. <#> Each time he met them at the station his very presence affirmed and reaffirmed again as he kissed them goodbye. <#> Within the house the outside world was shut out. <#> There was only Moran, their beloved father; within his shadow and the walls of his house they felt that they would never die; and each time they came to Great Meadow they grew again into the wholeness of being the unique and separate Morans. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'That boy thinks he can stroll in here any hour of the day or night he likes. <#> I 've warned him once and for all and I 'll not warn him again. <#> He may not take heed and if he doesn't I may need your help to bring him to his senses,' </quote> Moran confided to Sheila during one of the weekends the girls came from Dublin. <#> She nodded and listened. <#> She did not want to know where the talks led. <#> Tomorrow she would be back in Dublin. <quote> <#> 'To bring him once and for all to his senses; was like far-off thunder that could promise any sort of weather. </p>
 <p> <#> Moran 's warning on the night he locked Michael out had little effect but to make him more calculating. <#> For so many years he had been protected by the cushion of the others that he alone in the house had no residual fear of Moran. <#> When he was going to be late he now made some excuse. <#> Moran was often tired which was reason enough for him not to stay up to check the lateness. <#> But the sorest point was his constant need of money. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'You must think I 'm made of money. <#> You must think money grows on bushes. <#> You must think all I have to do is to go out and gather money like a few armfuls of hay for cattle. <#> I had no money at your age. <#> And none of the others in the house ever had the money you want.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Everybody at school has money, more money than I ever have,' </quote> the boy said resentfully. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Then their fools of fathers must have more money than sense. <#> I can tell you there 's no money here. <#> I can tell you that once and for all and for good.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Then Michael went to Rose. <#> Again she gave him small sums. <#> She was very fond of the boy, though by now, except for a coltish awkwardness, he was more man in height and strength than boy. <#> All of them now looked forward to Christmas. <#> Each night brought it one day nearer. <#> The girls would be coming home and all of them would be together again under the same roof. <#> Each dull night sharpened that anticipation. </p>
 <p> <#> Rose had already made the plum pudding. <#> It lay wrapped in dampened gauze in the biscuit tin on top of the dresser. <#> A week before Christmas Moran dragged a huge red-berried branch through the front door and dumped it in the middle of the room, filling the centre of the floor. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'What 's that doing here?' </quote> Rose asked in dismay. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Didn't you tell me to look out for berried holly? <#> You 'll not see much redder than that. <#> I don't know how it escaped the birds.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'I said a few sprigs not a whole tree.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Easier to cut the branch than pluck here and there among the thorns. <#> Can't you throw out what you don't want?' </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Oh Daddy, we just want a few bits for the windows and pictures. <#> But the berries are beautiful. <#> It 's such a pity to destroy a whole tree for a few sprigs.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'It 'd go to waste on the birds anyway. <#> Better to have too much than too little.' </quote> <#> He went out pleased by the mild censure of the tree of red berries lying in the middle of the floor. </p>
 <p> <#> It moved Rose to decorate the house at once in order to be rid of the huge branch, and Michael helped. <#> In an hour bits of berried holly were twisted in all the picture cords and left in rows along windowsills and shelves. <quote> <#> 'Daddy can never do anything by halves,' </quote> Rose laughed as they hauled the branch outside. <#> It still had enough berries to decorate several houses and they both laughed in indulgent amusement. </p>
 <p> <#> During these weeks at the prospect of his sisters ' homecoming Michael returned to being a child of the house. <#> He was poised on the blurred height, as eager to come down and be cradled and fussed over as to swagger and tomcat it out into the wild. <#> Maggie crossed over to Dublin the night before Christmas Eve. <#> She spent the day in Dublin and the three girls took the late train next day. </p>
 <p> <#> Moran left alone for the station. <#> Michael stayed outside the house in the cold clear night until suddenly the lighted squares of the diesel train rattled across the darkness of the Plains. <quote> <#> 'The train has passed!' </quote> he rushed inside to cry to Rose. <#> In spite of the cold he kept opening the front door. <#> Excited herself, and caught in his excitement, she had not the heart to tell him to keep it closed. <quote> <#> 'They're here!' </quote> he called to her as soon as the headlights turned into the short avenue, and leaving the door wide open they went to meet the car. <#> By the little wooden gate there were hugs and cries, eager kisses, the calling out of names, Sheila, Maggie, Michael, Mona, Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose, each name an utterance of pleasure and of joy. <#> They were home, they were home for Christmas. <#> Moran 's family were all, almost all, under the one roof for Christmas. <#> They had come to what they knew best in the world. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Look what I brought for Christmas,' </quote> Moran laughed proudly when they were all inside. <quote> <#> 'Three fine women.' </quote> <#> Words rushed against one another from the two who loved to talk, Maggie and Sheila, came to a stop against one another, laughed in impatience at each block, and rushed on. <#> Mona was silent or spoke quietly. </p>
 <p> <#> By the time tea was taken everyone was quieter and each of them speaking naturally. <#> All they had to do was observe the happy rituals: help prepare the turkey, remove the curtains from the front windows and light a single candle in each window, kneel to say the Rosary together, dress and get ready to go to midnight Mass. <#> As they knelt on the floor, Moran began, <quote> 'In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost we offer up this most holy Rosary for the one member of the family who is absent from the house tonight,' </quote> and the dramatizing of the exception drew uncomfortable attention to the disturbing bonds of their togetherness. </p>
 <p> <#> The three girls, Rose and Michael packed into the small car which Moran was driving to midnight Mass. <#> They sat on one another 's knees and joked. <quote> <#> 'I think you 've put on weight since you went to Dublin.' </quote> <quote> <#> 'Your knees haven't got softer anyhow since,' </quote> laughing and chattering away the discomfort of the physical constraint. <#> Single candles burned in the windows of all the houses they passed and pinpoints of light glittered as far as the first slopes of the mountain in the sea of darkness. </p>

 <p> <#> The entire thrust of recent government policy has been to tax wage earners highly, to penalise industry and to extract the very maximum taxation on all economic activity. <#> This extra money has been expropriated from the public by the Revenue Commissioners with ruthless efficiency. <#> That has been the real policy of the outgoing government and the Revenue Commissioners have carried out that policy dutifully. <#> That is their job. </p>
 <p> <#> The money collected has been transferred from individual wage earners in the private sector directly into the pockets of those working in the public sector. <#> Thus, since 1987 wages in the public sector have risen by 70 <*> per cent sign </*> , compared with a 44 <*> per cent sign </*> increase for everyone else. </p>
 <p> <#> Not only has that policy been unfair, it has had the effect of seriously slowing down, if not strangling, firms which otherwise would have been able to offer more employment. <#> That policy has to stop, it has to be reversed. </p>
 <p> <#> The outgoing Government constantly told us how good they were, but there was a large element of bluff in all their insistent assurances. <#> In fact, the last Government was held to ransom by the public sector. <#> The price was paid dearly by the unemployed and by those tens of thousands of bright young people who had to emigrate. <#> The funds which should have generated jobs were swept away into the public purse. <#> That was the true record of the last Government. </p>
 <p> <#> It was a policy which denied hundreds of thousands of our young people a right to live their lives, and to develop their careers here. <#> Those educated young people who are working in London, Birmingham, Paris and Berlin and as illegals in the United States have been cheated also of their Irish inheritance. <#> That policy can be changed, it must be changed. </p>
 <p> <#> The incoming Government must reduce taxes for lower paid workers. <#> That is the only way in which their standard of living can increase. <#> The new administration must insist on striking a more equitable balance between the public and the private sectors. </p>
 <p> <#> We believe that the Democratic Left, Fine Gael and the Labour Party will receive a strong, positive response if, together as a united front, they adopt a policy of social reform, based on equality and justice. </p>
 <p> <#> The Democratic Left is a Party with concise and practical ideas on the creation and the distribution of wealth and we do not believe that they are in any way the Party of extremists, as they are sometimes portrayed. </p>
 <p> <#> Similarly, once the Labour Party abandon their excessive use of shallow, public relations hyperbole and empty moral platitudes, they will gain greatly in public respect and will be in a better position to implement policies of genuine reform. <#> Fine Gael should also be able to work well with these partners because, despite its traditional middle class support, it has always been inspired by popular radicalism which was epitomised over a generation ago by Declan Costello 's <it> Just Society </it> document. <#> For all these reasons we believe that the partners share a common idealism and zeal for reform. </p>
 <p> <#> The new partners certainly have the potential and they have the will. <#> All they require is a genuine unity of purpose, a spirit of tolerance and a determination to be truly loyal to each other, at least for their term in office. <#> It can be done. <#> In the interests of the country it must be done. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Complexity of Adaptation in Real-World Case-Based Reasoning Systems </bold> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> 1 Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a reasoning method that uses experiential knowledge, in the form of cases, to solve problems. <#> When faced with a new problem a CBR system will retrieve a case that is similar, and, if necessary, adapt it to provide the desired solution. <#> Its current popularity as a problem solving paradigm is representative of the shift that has occurred in automated problem solving research; researchers are beginning to move from simple, ""toy"" domains to complex, real world domains. <#> With this move has come a recognition of the many inadequacies of traditional problem solving approaches, and assumptions previously deemed reasonable have proved invalid in complex, dynamic real world domains. <#> Case-based reasoning methods have proved useful in dealing with many of these problems and have had considerable initial success in real world problem solving endeavours.</p>
 <p> <#> Researchers have organised problem solving into three main classes. <#> In order of increasing complexity, these are: <it> simple, routine, </it> and <it> innovative </it>. <#> Simple problem solving activities are characterised by domains whose simplicity facilitate solution generation in a fairly straightforward fashion; there is a relatively direct inference path from problem specification to problem solution. <#> With routine problem solving, domains are more complex and often incomplete, problem specifications are conceptually quite distant from their solutions, and additional computational expense is incurred due to conflicts between dependent domain objects. <#> The most difficult activity, innovative problem solving, is identified by patchy domain models, intricate solution paths through the problem-space, and a considerable amount of backtracking due to interaction problems. </p>
 <p> <#> The aim of this paper is to characterise the relationship between case-based reasoning and problem solving tasks of differing complexity. <#> This relationship is discussed in detail in the next sections. <#> Sections three, four and five solidify this discussion by introducing three real CBR systems concerned with simple, routine, and innovative problem solving. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 2 Problem Solving Complexity and CBR </bold> <h>
 <p> <#> Our perspective on problem solving is concerned with search-based problem solving techniques. <#> Such problem solvers search a space of ""world models"" or ""problem states"" (the problem-space) to find one in which all the problem goals have been achieved (the goal state). <#> Search proceeds through the problem-space by the application of state-transforming operators. <#> The task of the problem solver is then to find some sequence of operators that transform the initial state into the goal state. <#> The complexity and cost of automated problem solving is well studied and there are many ways that it can be estimated. <#> The classic measure is the amount of search which has to be carried out in developing a solution to a problem. </p>
 <p> <#> Essentially, there are two search related problems associated with conventional problem solving methods. <#> The first, which we term the <it> operator chaining problem </it> <sp> 1 </sp>, is basically the problem of searching forward through the problem-space to find the appropriate sequence (chain) of operators with which to solve the target problem. <#> Relieving this problem has been (and still is) the objective of much research and has resulted in a range of relatively successful techniques (e.g. heuristic search, hierarchical planning, least commitment strategy, goal regression etc. ). <#> Further computational complexity arises from the <it> operator conflict problem </it> <sp> 2 </sp>. <#> As a planner interacts with its domain it receives a stream of conjunctive goals. <#> Were these goals independent of one another the cost of problem solving would be linear with the number of goals. <#> The reality is somewhat different. <#> Operator conflicts can result in unfavourable interactions between goals. <#> Under such conditions the problem solver must backtrack over earlier work in order to plan a new solution which avoids these interactions. <#> If somehow the problem solver could learn specific sequences of actions that overcome interaction problems in certain situations, the cost per goal could be reduced in the long run. </p>
 <p> <#> Case-based reasoning methods attempt to address both of these problems. <#> By constraining the problem-space search, it reduces the operator chaining problem; the retrieval of a similar case constitutes a considerable 'jump' into the problem space thereby eliminating many potential routes from the search. <#> Furthermore, CBR is potentially a more efficient constraint method than conventional approaches (e.g. heuristic evaluation etc.) whose scope is more local, pertaining to individual problem space states rather than whole areas. <#> Backtracking due to bad interactions may also be avoided, thereby relieving the operator conflict problem. <#> Effectively, cases can be viewed as 'canned' solutions where operator conflicts have been resolved in certain well defined situations As long as the retrieved case is sufficiently similar to the target relatively few conflicts should arise due to modifications made during adaptation. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> An Overview of CBR </bold> </h> <p> <#> In CBR, problem solving knowledge is characterised as a set of episodes each representing the solution to a specific problem situation. <#> A new problem (the <it> target </it>) is solved by retrieving a similar episode (<it> base case </it>) from memory, and its solution is then modified to conform with the target situation. <#> Cases are represented by features and relationships and case retrieval depends on matching these case representations. <#> It can be seen from the following description of the stages in CBR that the retrieval stages is a two stage process:- </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Representation:</bold> </h>: <#> Cases are represented by features and operators (relationships). <#> The features may be surface or abstract features and typically the more predictive features will be selected for indexing. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Base Filtering </bold> </h> : <#> A small number of candidate episodes which are considered contextually similar to the target situation are selected from the case base. <#> The case base will often be organised as a discrimination network (D-net) to facilitate this. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Case Selection / Mapping </bold> </h>: <#> This second stage will select a case from this candidate set based on a more detailed comparison of the cases. <#> A mapping between the base and target cases may also be produced at this stage. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Adaptation </bold> </h> : <#> Once the best case from the case base has been selected it must be adapted to fit the problem in hand. <#> In the simplest situations, for instance diagnosis, this adaptation may be trivial and the base case may apply without modification. <#> Adaptation may be very complex in more difficult problem domains, e.g. non routine design. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> 2.2 A CBR Perspective on Complexity </bold> </h> <#> Earlier we introduced the notion of a number of types of problem solving: simple, routine, and innovative. <#> In fact, we can view these as a continuum of problem solving tasks (Figure 1) organised in terms of computational complexity. <#> As illustrated, the relative contribution of the operator chaining and operator conflict problems varies across this continuum. <#> Due to the simplicity of their domains, simple problem solving tasks incur the bulk of their cost from the operator chaining problem; the lack of domain complexity leads to few conflicts so little time is spent backtracking. <#> At the other end of the continuum, the complexity of the domains of innovative problem solving tasks results in the operator conflict problem being very prominent (and expensive to resolve), with proportionately less time spent on the operator chaining problem. </p>
 <%> Figure 1 </%>
 <p> <#> The basic tenet of CBR is that, rather than solve a problem from first principles, it may be easier to retrieve a similar problem and transform the solution to that problem. <#> In Figure 2 we attempt to illustrate these trade-offs graphically. <#> SP' represents the specification for a new problem and SL' is the solution to that problem. <#> FP' represents the search process that establishes this solution from first principles - the task we wish to avoid. <#> A CBR solution is worthwhile if the retrieval task R, and the adaptation task A are simpler than FP'.</p>
 <&> Figure 2 </&>
 <p> <#> In the later sections of this paper we will examine three CBR systems that differ in the complexity of the transformation task A:- </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> Substitution Adaptation: </bold> </h> : <#> This is the simplest type of adaptation and merely involved substituting some of the parameters in the solution. </p>
 <p> <h> <bold> Transformational Adaptation: </bold> </h> : <#> This adaptation is more complex and will involve structural changes to the solution.</p>
 <p> <h> <bold> Generative Adaptation: </bold> </h>: <#> This is the most complex adaptation and is not perfectly represented by the diagram. <#> The adaptation process involves a rework of the reasoning process FP in the context of the new problem situation represented by SP'.</p>
 <p> <#> From a case-based reasoning perspective there is a relationship between the complexity of the problem solving task and the complexity of the CBR adaptation process. <#> CBR systems concerned with simple problem solving tasks will typically require simple, substitutional adaptation; the retrieved case will typically be very close to the target and consequently will require only very basic substitutive adaptation, with little or no chance of bad interactions occurring. <#> With routine problem solving tasks, the retrieved case, while being similar to the target, will probably require substantial modification possibly changing some structural elements of the retrieved solution (transformational adaptation), and innovative problem solving tasks extensive modifications are necessary during adaptation so interactions are unavoidable and difficult to resolve. <#> To accommodate this adaptation complexity it is generally necessary to augment cases with detailed knowledge such as the reasoning trace structures of Carbonell 's Derivational Analogy. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 3 Rachman: Substitutional Adaptation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Simple problem solving tasks are characterised by well-defined domain models, and a relatively direct inference path from problem specification to problem solution. <#> Case-based reasoning methods are particularly well suited to such tasks as there is often a rich set of cases to draw upon during problem solving. <#> The retrieved case is typically very similar to the target problem and consequently the adaptation problem is relatively uncomplicated; in general modifying the attributes of solution elements will suffice without the need to change the overall solution structure. </p>
 <&> Figure 3 </&>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> 3.1 A Brief Overview of Rachman </bold> </h> <#> Figure 3 shows two example cases from a case-based system called Rachman that can predict the selling value of a house given some details about it. <#> The system contains a large case base of houses and their selling prices and, given a house description, it will retrieve a case or a set of cases describing similar houses and their selling prices. <#> These prices can be adjusted depending on differences between the target and base cases to estimate the price of the target house. <#> This system is comparatively straightforward but is equivalent to a host of potential CBR applications, for example loan risk assessment and help-desk assistants. <#> The complexity of this problem is greatly reduced by having a well populated case base, so that good matches can be found and the required adaptation is not difficult.</p>
 <p> <#> The cases are divided into two sets of features, the index features and the internal features. <#> The index features are the most strongly predictive features and form the basis for the D-Net (Figure 4). <#> The main problem with the D-Net approach is that it forces a strict ordering of the index features, in this example the cases might be organised first under location, then number of bedrooms, etc. <#> However, different users may have different priorities; some, for instance, might consider the number of bedrooms to be more important than location. <#> In addition, it will not be possible to retrieve matches for cases that have missing features as the retrieval process will not be able to search below the level of that feature in the network.</p>
 <p> <#> These problems are largely solved by introducing redundancy into the D-Net. <#> This means that the network supports alternative orderings on the index features (see Figure 4). <#> The extent to which redundancy can be introduced into the network is limited because the size of the network grows in proportion to the number of orderings supported. <#> Retrieval in Rachman returns clusters of cases and the cases are ranked according to their frequency of occurrence in these clusters. </p>
 <&> Figure 4 </&>
 <p> <h> <bold> <#> 3.2 Substitutional Adaptation in Rachman </bold> </h> <#> It is assumed with this system that the case base is well populated so that near or exact matches can be found. <#> This means that the adaptation is comparatively straightforward using substitution specialists that adjust the price based on differences between the base and target cases. <#> For instance a substitution specialist may add or remove the value of having a conservatory. <#> The important point is that the effect of this adjustment is quite local and does not cause complex interactions.</p>
 <h> <bold> <#> D&/ej&\a Vu: Transformational Adaptation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In a CBR system for routine problem solving, retrieved cases, while being comparatively similar to the target, will probably require substantial structural modification. <#> Consequently a limited opportunity exists for bad interactions to occur. <#> Carbonell (Carbonell, 1983) characterises such problem solvers as belonging to the realm of <it> <}> <-> Tranformational </-> <+> Transformational </+> </}> Analogy </it>. <#> Essentially, the adaptation stage can be considered as a solution transformation problem. <#> Finding the appropriate transformation is itself a problem-solving process, but in a different problem space. <#> The states of this transformation-space (T-space) are problem solutions, as opposed to solution states. <#> The transformation-space operators (T-operators) are atomic solution transformation operators (e.g., Substitute Solution Step, Delete Solution Step, Insert Solution Step, Reorder Solution Steps). <#> And the job of adaptation is to find the appropriate sequence of T-operators which will transform the retrieved solution into the desired target solution (See Figure 5). </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Inequalities in Preparation for University Entrance: An Examination of the Educational Histories of Entrants to University College, Cork </bold> </h>
 <h> <#> INTRODUCTION </h>
 <p> <#> University students are a highly selected population in that of all those who seek university places in any given year only a proportion succeed. <#> While the selection process is 'objective' in that places are allocated on the basis of examination results, studies of third level entrants have indicated that students from the higher socio-economic groups are over-represented within the higher status (and higher points) faculties (Clancy 1982, 1988). </p>
 <p> <#> Most students obtain their places on the basis of achievement in the Leaving Certificate examination. <#> Some achieve entry on the results of the Matriculation Examination of the National University of Ireland (NUI). <#> Indeed, many students seeking places in NUI colleges sit both examinations as the two sets of results may be combined to calculate points in the allocation of places in these colleges. <#> One can thus 'improve' one 's chance of a university place in the NUI by sitting both examinations. </p>
 <p> <#> Students usually sit for the Leaving Certificate and/or the Matriculation at the end of a five year post-primary programme. <#> There are, however, schools which take six years to complete the course. <#> Schools offering the longer course tend to be the more prestigious academic secondary schools, many of them fee-paying. <#> There are undoubted advantages to a six year programme. <#> Students are usually older and more mature when sitting the Leaving Certificate. <#> The extra year also permits students to develop academic and other skills of lasting value. <#> Students taking six year programmes sit the same examinations and compete for the same university places with those from five year schools. <#> This must give them at least some advantage in the competition for university places. </p>
 <p> <#> In recent years some schools have been given the option of offering an extra 'transition' year to pupils between the end of the junior and the beginning of the senior cycles. <#> This extra year will undoubtedly perform the function of permitting the maturation of students prior to taking the Leaving Certificate. <#> In addition, transition programmes provide all students, those seeking third level entrance and those intending to complete formal education at the end of the senior cycle, with skills and knowledge of a wider and more practical type than would be attained within the traditional curriculum. <#> However, not all schools have sought, or been given, this option. <#> Further, when available within any given school, the transition year may be optional, or may be available to selected pupils only, for example, those who are adjudged too young to proceed to senior cycle, or those who are perceived by the school authorities as being capable of benefitting from it, however this may be judged. </p>
 <p> <#> Students failing to obtain a university place, or their preferred place, may re-sit for one or both examinations, on one or more occasions. <#> There are indications that this practice is becoming more popular. <#> In some third level institutions, including universities (though excluding University College Dublin and University College Cork), students are permitted to combine the results of more than one sitting of these examinations for purposes of scoring 'points ', though this practice is to be discontinued as and from 1992. <#> However, students will continue to have a second or further chance to compete for a third level place without penalty apart from an extra year in school and the payment of the appropriate fees. </p>
 <p> <#> It might be argued, then, that students competing for university and other third level places to not do so on an equal footing. <#> Some students have prepared for five years, others for six, even seven, as some who repeat the examinations do so following a six year school programme. <#> Students who re-sit on one or more occasions might also be considered to have benefitted from examination practice.</p>
 <p> <#> The vast majority of Irish children receive their education within 'recognised' post-primary schools. <#> All these schools, including those charging fees, receive government funding, the amount and type being dependent on the type of school. <#> Nonetheless, students at fee-paying schools are charged significantly less than the economic cost of their education as are students who elect to repeat the Leaving Certificate within 'recognised' schools. <#> Thus, much of the extra preparation for third level entrance is paid for from public funds, although it is individuals who benefit. </p>
 <p> <#> Students preparing for examinations leading to third level entrance may also seek extra help in one or more subjects. <#> Occasionally, this may be obtained at home, from family or friends, or schools may offer some students additional classes. <#> More commonly, however, such help is obtained outside the family and school from individuals or groups who offer specific examination coaching in one or more subjects. <#> In recent years there appears to be an increase in the number of individuals and tutorial colleges offering specialised individual or small class tuition. <#> The colleges may also run short intensive revision courses in the school holidays, and some also provide a full-time Leaving Certificate course, aimed mostly at students repeating for better results. </p>
 <p> <#> None of these groups or individuals receives any state support. <#> They operate as business enterprises, charging relatively high fees on an hourly or yearly basis. <#> We do not know how many students use these facilities, and for what subjects. <#> Nor do we know who uses them, or whether they give students an advantage when competing for scarce third level places. <#> That their numbers appear to be growing and that they are paid for out of individuals ' pockets seems to indicate that at least some people believe that extra tuition is valuable. <#> As a relatively expensive 'optional extra' it is likely that the students who use such facilities are from the more advantaged social backgrounds. <#> They may also be lower ability students, though this is not necessarily the case and we have no evidence to support it. </p>
 <p> <#> How do students select from among the various educational options outlined above? <#> Are different patterns evident among students from different social backgrounds? <#> These are the concerns of this study. </p>
 <h> <#> METHODOLOGY </h>
 <p> <#> The study is a pilot study of an exploratory nature. <#> It was limited to Irish students who entered UCC in 1989 and who had competed for their university places through the Central Admissions Office (CAO), that is, those who were awarded university degree places on the basis of 'points '. <#> We thus excluded all foreign students and mature students who are awarded places on a quota basis. <#> Information was collected from students in the classroom using an administered questionnaire. <#> We attempted complete coverage of the population to simplify data collection. </p>
 <p> <#> In faculties where first year students follow common courses, the problems of locating students were few. <#> The faculties of Arts and Science posed particular problems. <#> Science students should have proved less difficult to contact than students in Arts as all science students are required to take on or two courses in Mathematics. <#> Coverage of these two classes ought to have given us access to all first science students. As Arts students are not required to take any common subject, we selected two large classes that are timetabled back to back in first year, Sociology and French. <#> Almost 80 per cent of all first Arts students were registered for one or other of these courses and on further investigation we discovered that a high proportion of the remaining students were registered in Applied Psychology. <#> Coverage of these three classes should have provided us with access to over 90 per cent of all first Arts students. </p>
 <p> <#> Non-attendance at class proved the greatest obstacle to complete coverage and we were less successful than we had hoped in obtaining information from all the students. <#> The Arts and Science faculties were the most problematic with non-attendance of up to 25 per cent in at least one of the classes we visited. <#> In addition to non-attendance there were some students who refused to complete the questionnaire. <#> The number here were small, however, and it was non-attendance rather than refusals which account for the difference between the numbers we obtained and the numbers in the targeted population. <#> Complete coverage was obtained in Social Science, and almost complete coverage in Commerce (97 per cent). <#> The coverage in the other faculties was: Electrical Engineering 88 per cent, Medicine 87 per cent, Law 82 per cent, Dentistry 81 per cent, Civil Engineering 80 per cent, Arts 66 per cent and Science 63 per cent. <#> In all we obtained information from 77 per cent of the targeted population, which is three hundred and sixteen students short of complete coverage. <#> We feel the coverage is adequate for a pilot study. </p>
 <h> <#> THE RESULTS </h>
 <p> <#> Information was collected from 1058 students, all of whom entered UCC in 1989 and had competed for their places through the CAO. <#> Only students who had received their second level education within Ireland were included. <#> Over 70 per cent of the students were from Cork city or county; 21 per cent were from the rest of Munster, 6 per cent were from Leinster and the remainder came from Connaught and Ulster, including the six counties of Northern Ireland. <#> They ranged in age from seventeen to twenty-one. <#> The mean age was eighteen. <#> More than half the students were women (59.6 per cent). </p>
 <p> <#> The students came from all social classes (see Table 1), but as in previous studies of university entrants the higher social classes were over represented (Clancy, 1982, 1988). <#> Seventy-five per cent of our respondents came from families where the chief earner was in a non-manual job, or was a farmer with over 50 acres. <#> Twenty-eight per cent of students were in receipt of higher education grants and 1.6 per cent held scholarships. </p>
 <&> Table 1 inserted </&>
 <p> <#> Most students, then, depended on their parents to provide the finance for their education, though a small number of students supported themselves wholly or in part. <#> Over sixty percent were from families where neither parent had received third level education. </p>
 <p> <#> Previous studies of third level entrants found that students from secondary schools were more likely to enter universities than those who had been educated at community, comprehensive or vocational schools. <#> Our population displayed the same pattern. <#> Eighty-five percent of our respondents had attended secondary schools, 12 per cent had been to community or comprehensive schools, and a mere 3 per cent had been to vocational schools. <#> Almost 25 per cent of all students had attended fee paying secondary schools. <#> We did not calculate the transfer rate for each type of school but we found that 23.6 per cent of all first year entrants to UCC in 1989 had attended one of three fee paying schools in Cork city. <#> We estimate that between them these three schools cater for just under 10 per cent of the post-primary pupils in the city. <#> Further, an examination of the schools attended by students from Cork city indicate that students from non-fee paying schools in predominantly middle class areas of the city are over represented in our population. </p>
 <p> <#> We asked students to indicate the length of secondary programme they had followed, the number of times they had attempted Leaving Certificate and/or Matriculation, whether they had repeated any year during their post-primary education, the amount and type of extra tuition they had received (if any), and the subjects in which it was obtained. <#> They were also asked to indicate the cost of any coaching they had received. <#> With this information, we were able to identify the ways in which students prepared to compete for university places. </p>

 <p> <#> Seventy-three percent of the students had attended schools which offered a five year post-primary programme. <#> One in five of these students, however, had spent six years at post-primary level prior to university entrance. <#> Students in five year programmes extended their stay in school in one of two ways: (1) they repeated the Leaving Certificate (68 per cent) or (2) they opted to repeat a year earlier in the post-primary programme. <#> Students who took this latter option usually repeated 5th year, though there was a small number, seven in all, who had retaken the first year in post-primary school. </p>
 <p> <#> Two hundred and seventy-seven, or 26.2 per cent of the total population, had followed a six year post-primary programme. <#> Here, too, there were students who had extended their post-primary education by at least one year. <#> The number doing so was small (33) but it amounts to 12 per cent of all students from six year programmes. <#> As with those in five year schools two methods of extending the programme were employed. <#> Two thirds of these 'seven year' students spent the extra year repeating the Leaving Certificate, the others, with one exception, repeated 5th year. </p>
 <p> <#> In all, 421 students spent six or more years at post-primary level. <#> This is 40 per cent of all first year entrants to UCC in 1989. </p>

 <h> <ul> <#> All About the Driving Test </h> </ul>
 <h> <bold> <#> REQUIREMENTS FOR UNDERGOING YOUR DRIVING TEST </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> 1. Take along a valid Irish provisional licence for the category of the driving test you are now undergoing. </p>
 <p> <#> 2. Your vehicle must be in roadworthy condition, with lights, brakes and signals in working order. </p>
 <p> <#> 3. Your vehicle must display a current tax disc with proper registration number shown. </p>
 <p> <#> 4. Your vehicle must display a valid insurance disc (if Irish registered) with registration number, not chassis number, shown. </p>
 <p> <#> 5. L plates (15 cm <sp> 2 </sp> ) with a red L on a white background should be displayed front and rear of all vehicles except motorbikes and tractors. </p>
 <p> <#> 6. Bring along your appointment slip. <#> If you cannot keep this appointment, you should give at least 10 days notice, otherwise you will forfeit your fee and have to re-apply for a new test. </p>
 <p> <#> Conditions 1 to 5 are legal requirements. <#> Failing any of these, your driving test will not be conducted and you will lose your fee and go back to the end of the waiting list. </p>
 <p> <#> Please note that your driving examiner is exempt from wearing a seat belt (if he/she so wishes), do not insist on him/her wearing it. </p>
 <p> <#> Also note that if either tax or insurance disc is faded or illegible, you must have them replaced prior to the test. <#> Trade plates are not acceptable for undergoing your test. </p>
 <p> <#> Use the boxes provided on page 9 to tick off requirements several days before your test, thus giving you the time to have everything in order for the day. </p>
 <p> <#> <bold> N.B. </bold> <#> If you have just realised that <bold> your provisional licence is out of date </bold> for the day of your test, you will need to have it replaced. <#> This procedure is not as simple as it used to be. <#> Driving licences or provisional licences are not handed out over the counter as was the practice previously. <#> Now you must receive your documents through the post. <#> In some areas this may take several weeks. <#> However, if your driving test is imminent, you should bring your driving test appointment slip and a completed provisional licence form, not forgetting two photographs, to your relevant licencing authority, and see the supervisor in charge. <#> He/she will normally issue your licence within a couple of hours. <#> Note that the licence application, depending on your category, may require general medical information. <#> You may use the form D501, available through your local tax office, and have it completed and signed by your general practitioner. <#> Persons over the age of 70 will also need this certificate of fitness (D501). </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Eyesight Test: </bold> all applicants for a provisional licence for categories A1, A, B, EB or W must undergo a once-off eyesight test. <#> If your optician has stated that you must wear corrective lenses, you should not forget them for the test, or indeed ever drive without them. <#> This information is recorded on your licence with the words, <quote> ""corrective lenses must be worn."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Medical Test: </bold> <#> Applicants for a provisional licence for categories C, C1, D, D1, EC, EC1, ED or ED1 must undergo a medical examination (see page 101). </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Special Driving Tests: </bold> <#> Candidates applying for a driving test, who have any disability (difficulty of hearing or any other physical disability) should have their practitioner fill out the form D501, certificate of fitness. <#> It would also be courteous to include any detail they might find informative to the Department, e.g. any special adaptations to the vehicle they propose to use for the driving test. <#> These should be attached and sent to: <#> <it> The Driver Testing Section, Department of the Environment, Government Offices, Ballina, Co.Mayo. Phone: 096-70677 </it>
 <p> <#> If you have any special queries regarding your particular disability, you should write to or phone the above address. </p>

 <h> <#> (The Driving Test <it> in Irish </it> ) </h>
 <p> <#> In order to undergo a driving test through the Irish language you must fill out a special application form, available through your local Motor Taxation Office. <#> Your test will then be conducted through Irish, i.e. the Questions and Answers part of the test and directions for your practical driving. <#> There is also a separate form for those wishing to have their Driving Licence document in Irish. <#> To obtain these forms you should contact your local taxation office. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> STEP BY STEP THROUGH THE TEST </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The diagram shows the main points an examiner looks out for. <#> They are not necessarily in order as it will depend on the examiner on the day and the direction he chooses to take. <#> However, you may use it as a guide to the amount you will have to do on the day. </p>
 <p> <#> The diagram on page 17 is based on a category B driving test (see page 12) which lasts about 45 minutes. <#> Other categories may well last longer (see HGV, page 102). </p>
 <p> <#> Do not overlook the minutes of relaxation after your driving test as you will have been stressed throughout that period. <#> Rest for several minutes before returning to the road. <#> This will have a calming down effect immediately after your test. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> General procedure on the day of the test </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Arrive at the test centre at least 10 minutes prior to your appointed time. <#> You should wait in the waiting room and let the receptionist know you are there. <#> Your name will be called in due course. </p>
 <p> <#> The initial part will start after you produce your current Irish provisional licence to the examiner and sign the required administration forms including a Declaration of Road Worthiness and Insurance (see page 19). <#> The Questions and Answers part of the examination should then take place, after which you will be asked to identify some road traffic signs. </p>
 <p> <#> You will then accompany the examiner to the vehicle where he/she will check your tax and insurance disc and inspect your L plates (front and rear) and generally check the condition of your vehicle. <#> In the case of a HGV, the examiner will check the lights, indicators, stop lights and generally all electrics, not forgetting the minimum number of mirrors, one left and one right. <#> Before moving away, your examiner will say words to this effect: <quote> ""There should be no further conversation in the vehicle between you and me other than to tell you to turn right or left. <#> In the absence of a right or a left, I would like you to assume straight. <#> If, however, you don't understand, you may ask and I will repeat."" </quote> <#> Don't be unduly worried about this, as it is all part of the test. <#> Try not to be put off by his/her presence in the vehicle. <#> Your examiner may take notes during your diving test. <#> Do not be alarmed at this as it is normal procedure. <#> If you show that you are a competent and confident driver you should pass your test. <#> Remember your training! </p>
 <p> <#> He/she will ask you to move away and take whatever direction the examiner has planned. <#> You will be asked to go right or left. <#> For the most part, a high percentage of examiners will ask you to do a turnabout as a first manoeuvre, followed shortly by a reverse into a limited opening on the left. <#> This is almost certainly followed by arm/handsignals and finally a hill start. <#> This may not be the exact sequence in your test centre, as this will depend on the number of examiners working from the test centre on that day and on the obstructions and traffic within the areas intended for your manoeuvres. </p>
 <p> <#> Your test route will be a well balanced drive including moving away, right turns, left turns, driving along main roads, emerging at junctions, traffic lights, use of traffic lanes, road position, use of controls, mirrors and signals. <#> And remember general observation will play a very big part in your test. </p>
 <p> <#> Almost before you know it, you will be on the way back to the test centre. <#> You will have been concentrating so much, you will wonder where the time went! </p>
 <p> <#> Examiners are not normally allowed to speak to you during your test. <#> Most examiners will not do so. <#> This is because it is felt that it would impair your concentration. <#> In fact, many an examiner has been reprimanded for trying to calm a person down or for trying to help them relax. <#> Complaints have been known to be made when such situations have occurred, this is why the rule now rigidly applies. </p>
 <p> <#> On your return to the test centre, you will accompany the examiner into the centre where you will be informed whether you gained your Certificate of Competency or not. <#> Examiners are not allowed to discuss the reasons for failing (see page 68 on the K Form). <#> A very high percentage of failures are due to three main reasons: <#> 1. faults relating to vehicle control and road procedure <#> 2. lack of professional tuition <#> 3. incorrect observation </p>
 <p> <#> Remember, nerves alone should not bring about a refusal of a Certificate of Competency. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> General points - Rules of the Road </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Study the Rules of the Road handbook as this book, <it> The Driving Test in Ireland, </it> is not meant to replace the one which is issued by the National Safety Council for the Minister of the Environment. </p>
 <p> <#> The contents of this government handbook are tested orally at the Questions and Answers part of the test. <#> It is indeed recommended that a person who has passed the driving test should periodically read the latest edition, as new laws, regulations and EC directives are introduced all the time. </p>
 <p> <#> You should be able to answer questions in your own words. <#> You should know all the warning signs: regulatory and informative, road signs and road markings. <#> A key factor in answering any question on the Rules of the Road would be to think of the safety aspect first. <#> Although this book refers a lot to the ""Driving test"", it must go without saying that ""test standard"" is a good standard to maintain for the rest of your life. <#> Never think, ""I have to drive like this for a test"" and the next day forget all you have been taught. <#> Your life could depend on the good habits acquired under the guidance of your driving instructor! </p>

 <h> <bold> <ul> <#> Control Procedure </bold> </ul> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> COCKPIT DRILL </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The proper procedure should be to demonstrate to the examiner the use of the normal everyday pre-start checks. </p>
 <#> D/S/S/S/M
 <p> <bold> <#> Doors: </bold> <#> Make sure all doors are properly closed. </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Seats: </bold> <#> Properly adjusted, mainly to suit your clutch control as this pedal is generally the only one that reaches the floor. </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Steering: </bold> <#> Allow the back of your seat to be sufficiently forward for your arms not to have to stretch. <#> A proper position would be with the elbows bent. </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Seat belts: </bold> <#> Make sure you have placed your seat belts flat across your body with no twist as this could have the effect of a knife 's edge in the case of a sudden stop. </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Mirrors: </bold> <#> Ensure that all available mirrors are adjusted to suit you and are kept clean at all times. <#> Adjust inside mirror by using the top and bottom of the mirror base, without touching the glass itself. </p>
 <h> <bold> <ul> <#> USE OF CONTROLS </bold> </ul> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Accelerator </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> You should be able to operate it smoothly and sensibly. <#> Never accelerate too fast for the conditions you are driving in. <#> This is for control reasons, not to mention the cost factor in doing so as the harsher the acceleration/deceleration is, the more fuel you use.</p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Footbrake </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> You should be able to stop smoothly, effectively and without jerking, except in an emergency. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Clutch </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> You should be able to operate your clutch smoothly, know your 'biting point' (gripping point) and use only when required. <#> When finished using the clutch, remove your foot completely from the pedal as a partially depressed clutch will burn out the clutch. <#> You should be able to coordinate the clutch with the handbrake and accelerator when moving off from a stationary position and when on a hill. <#> Do not coast to a stop, that is to say, do not travel with your clutch depressed for an distance greater than necessary. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Steering </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Keep both hands on the wheel at all times except when operating a control or giving a signal. <#> Your hands should be level on the wheel i.e. ten to two or a quarter to three (clock face position). <#> This is the best operating position for the pull/push movement which is recommended. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Horn </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Many people are reluctant to use the horn during a driving test when in fact, at times, it is imperative. <#> For instance, it could be recommended to attract the attention of a pedestrian who is about to step onto the road in front of you and who, you feel, is not aware of you presence, or in a sharp turn where visibility is limited or obscured. </p>
 <p> <#> These are just two instances. <#> However, normal use of this instrument should not be excessive or aggressive. </p>
 <p> <#> One should also note that between the hours of 11.30 pm (23.30) and 7.00 am (07.00), the horn should not be used except for a traffic emergency. </p>

 <p> <#> Dear Roisin, <#> How 's it going? <#> Just a quick letter to say <quote> 'hello' </quote> before I pop off to Australia for the summer. <#> I have been meaning to write for some time (bought the Air Mail stamp some time ago indeed), but as usual I have left it to the last minute (I head early on 11th June and have still 2 cases and an essay to write for Friday, a party to go to on Friday night and all my shopping and packing to do!) </p>
 <p> <#> Things had been relatively quiet until recently. <#> I must have seen you last towards the end of April. <#> Since then I have tried to limit my drinking to one night a week, <}> <-> or be it </-> <+> albeit </+> </}> one very big night a week.</p>
 <p> <#> The first weekend in April, our 'section' of the class headed on our first trip to Sellafield (that lovely safe, clean nuclear power station on the other side of the Irish Sea, which has nothing to do at all with leukaemia in children in Co. Down!!) <#> As you can see, they have managed to bullshit and bribe us well Ð who knows what a few free Guinness and a free meal can do!! <#> We even got to stand on top of a nuclear reactor, and I didn't even get a tan. <#> On the way back from Sellafield, 4 of us jumped off the bus and headed to Glasgow to meet up with another bunch of medics who were meeting up with some Glasgow medics. <#> A nasty weekend indeed Ð to the tune of <*> pound sign </*> 125. <#> But well worth the lack of memories!!</p>
 <p> <#> The following weekend we had the pleasure of entertaining 4 <&French> jeune femme </&French> from Galway. <#> I would describe them more as 'jolly' than <&French> 'jolie'. </&French> <#> However much alcohol was consumed by all and soon 'jolly' became 'jollier' and finally progressed to <&French> 'jolie' </&French> under the influence of beer glasses. <#> Ask Bill O'Neill sometime Ð who else? <#> Of course I was too sober to indulgeÉ</p>
 <p> <#> Things got pretty quiet after that, so myself and my entrepreneurial (my, what a big word for a medical student!) partner, Mr Fiachra Ryan took it upon ourselves to organise a 'mystery' tour. <#> To most of us it still remains a mystery, not least to myself. <#> The first destination was a bar in Bushmills where we spent considerable time getting drunk and ""singing"" <}> <-> karioke </-> <+> karaoke </+> </}> . <#> Considering I was directing the bus-driver <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> a wonder we ever got back at all. <#> At least I did better than Fergie. <#> Apparently he took it upon himself to direct the driver in a difficult reversing manoeuvre at the end of our journey and he navigated the bus directly into a railing. <#> 'Good man, Fergy.' </p>
 <p> <#> The last big social event on the calendar was the year formal last week in the Castle. <#> I even brought a partner this yearÉ.the inimitable, stunning, personableÉMr. Patrick Casey. <#> Well he had just finished his exams that day, and he had no-one else to go out with to celebrate, andÉwell, yes, I am a sad bastard. <#> Nevertheless he enjoyed it, I enjoyed itÉall in all, a good <}> <-> nights </-> <+> night 's </+> </}> crackÉ.except for being blown out by a CU girl. <#> I thought that we had her well corrupted and allegedly we had tackled before when we were both very drunk (hence I can't remember it), but obviously she still doesn't know the meaning of a good time!! </p>

 <h> <#> Miche&/al Mac Gr&/eil, S.J. <bold> The Social Tasks of Education <*> asterisk </*> </bold> </h>
 <h> Miche&/al Mac Gr&/eil, S.J. lectures in Sociology at St Patrick 's College, Maynooth </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Introduction - Definition and Functions of Education </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Like most concepts in wide public use, education means different things to different people. <#> In the context of this paper, I accept that education is:
 <quote> <it> That formal part of the process of socialization through which the culture of the people is transmitted to the young and they (the young) are taught the necessary (technical and social) skills for the pursuit of an occupation and the living of a full adult life in the community </quote> </it> <#> The addition of <quote> 'equipping the young to adapt to social change' </quote> might be added by those who would focus on <it> change.</it> </p>
 <p> <#> It is clear from the above definition that there are three main functions of education, i.e. <#> 1) the personal development of the young person; <#> 2) the provision of necessary occupational skills; <#> 3)socialization in the basic domestic and social skills. </p>
 <h> 1. <it> <#> Personal Development of the Young Person: </it> </h>
 <p> <#> This is primarily achieved through the transmission of the convictions, values, norms and symbolic systems of the people 's culture. <#> The young adult needs a broad cultural education to become a critical and rationally self-conscious human being capable of having a spiritual and aesthetic life. <#> Languages and humanities are invaluable in this regard. <#> Of course, the domestic environment of the young person influences the proper disposition for such an education. <#> The value of philosophy, theology, creative arts and literature - classical and modern - could hardly be over-rated for the rich development of a young adult. </p>
 <p> <#> Socialization in what is best of <it> one 's own culture </it> is important. <#> Not to be educated in one 's own culture 'deradicalises' young people and cuts them off from their own people, with inevitable problems for their self-worth. <#> We have seen the evidence of damage done to people who have been socialized out of their people 's culture in Ireland, in Africa and elsewhere. </p>
 <p> <#> Unfortunately, in Ireland, we tend to neglect to educate people reared in rural and working-class sub-cultures in their own culture. <#> One of the reasons for the disappointing levels of working-class and the so-called 'lower class' participation in our senior second level and third level programmes may be the cultural alienation which arises from the imposition of exclusively 'middle-class' subcultural ideas, values, norms and symbolic systems in our schools system. </p>
 <p> <#> With the emphasis on materialism and individualism today we are in danger of neglecting the personal and cultural development of the person. <#> A society that neglects this aspect of education may well pay the price in the creation of an intellectually under-developed and socially and politically uncritical population. </p>
 <h> 2. <it> <#> Transmission of Occupational Skills: <it> </h>
 <p> <#> This is the second important function of education. <#> Such skills equip the young person to perform a job that is socially useful and personally satisfying. <#> In past times, most of the occupational skills required were handed on informally from one generation to the next. <#> With the advance of literacy and technology and the changes in the range of occupational opportunities, there have been two significant changes or developments, i.e. <#> (a) a shift from manual skills to non-manual and semi-automated and robotic skills; <#> (b) a relatively drastic decline in agricultural-type and manual work and a growth in the demand and sophistication of the 'services sector'. </p>
 <p> <#> Over the past twenty-five years in Ireland, there has been substantial decline in the proportion of people engaged in blue-collar manual skilled and semi-skilled work, and in what were defined as <quote> 'routine non-manual workers', </quote> e.g. typists and clerks. <#> (The present audience has witnessed this change close at hand). <#> The automation of formerly labour-intensive work (including skilled work), e.g. the printing trade, and of routine non-manual work, e.g. bank clerks and typing pools, has had serious consequences for the education system. </p>
 <p> <#> The continuing change in the skills required raises the question of early specialization. <#> Retaining will be required within industry as the requisite technological skills change. <#> This has implications for the training in skills within the formal educational system. <#> Many of the skilled occupations today have almost an in-built obsolescence in them. </p>
 <p> <#> There is a second area of occupational skills which modern Irish society requires of its workers, namely the necessary 'organizational skills' required of managers, supervisors and shop stewards. <#> Most serious work in society is performed by groups of workers working in some degree of 'organic' inter-dependence. <#> It is said that over 50 per cent of qualified accountants end up in <it> managerial roles </it> in companies and businesses, with workforces made up of diverse skills, trades and professions. <#> The days of exclusively technological curricula are numbered for the main body of students. <#> The choice of occupations and professions should be largely determined by the needs of Irish society and of the students ' local communities in the first instance. <#> Otherwise, Irish society will end up educating and training its young people for stronger and more developed communities. <#> The range of skills transmitted to the young in our less developed areas should equip them to become involved in the development of these areas. </p>
 <p> <#> The Irish educational system has tended to <it> work against the best interests of our weaker urban and rural communities. </it> <#> As a result those with greatest talent were syphoned away from their local communities without a commensurate inward migration of talent. <#> This is evident in the West of Ireland. <#> It is true internationally. <#> It would not be unreasonable to discourage <it> laissez-faire </it> geographic mobility of talent. <#> This may mean taking a stand against the EU policy of free mobility of labour. <it> <#> Laissez-faire </it> geographic mobility is an example of the immediate advantages (in monetary terms) of the individual talented person being diametrically opposed to the social advantages of his or her community of origin. </p>
 <p> <#> In Ireland expensive third level resources are spent on many young people whose productive lives will be spent to the advantage of an already strong society overseas! <#> It is common to learn of whole university classes of highly qualified engineers and scientists being employed abroad. </p>
 <h> 3. <it> <#> Social and Domestic Skills: </it> </h>
 <p> <#> The third principal function of education is the transmission of the social and domestic skills required by adults live full lives in the community and participate in the maintenance of a high quality of social life. <#> These include an ability to take part in the political and voluntary organizations which enrich local communities. <#> Serious social problems are due to the lack of involvement of people in a constructive manner in their local communities. <#> This is particularly true of urban societies. </p>
 <p> <#> Social and domestic problems are increasing in Ireland. <#> Coping with unemployment, poor housing planning, substance abuse, family problems, minority discrimination, environmental pollution, and so forth, are major concerns for many citizens. <#> What has our education system done to help prevent or alleviate these problems? <#> Not as much as it should, as far as I can see. </p>
 <p> <#> While it would be unreasonable to expect the educational system to solve these problems, we should, at least, equip our young citizens to cope with them a little better. <#> The social change necessary to solve some of these problems must be, at the end of the day, a political and socio-economic issue or a decision involving radical transfers of resources and structural changes which may impinge on the privileges of the most powerful groups in our society. </p>
 <p> <#> A truly comprehensive education today, therefore, must devote greater attention to the transmission of domestic, social and political skills to those entering young adulthood. <#> Many experienced social workers will say that the lack of domestic organizational skills to cope with family demands frequently leads to marital and family breakdown. <#> I am not saying that the school should replace the home as the place of primary domestic socialization. <#> Rather it must supplement it. </p>
 <p> <#> The role of <it> adult education </it> in making up for the deficiency in the transmission of domestic, social and political skills, over recent years, especially through concerned local women 's groups, has been a most welcome development. <#> I would like to see this compensatory role being developed further to include the involvement of more men in the various community programmes. <#> There should be a 'feedback' from adult and community groups into the second and tertiary levels in this area. </p>
 <h> 4. <it> <#> Education and Social Change: </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Many sociologists of education see 'social change' as a primary function of education. <#> Some see education as our primary instrument of social change while others would see it as the means of adapting to change. </p>
 <p> <#> The sociologist Talcott Parsons and others view education 's main function as 'pattern maintenance', in other words, the reproduction and continuity of the social system. <#> Can the same institution therefore be expected to serve two apparently contradictory functions in the one society? </p>
 <p> <#> While in a sense both aspects are served, the primary function for education seems to be more continuity than change. <#> This is not to say that when change emerges from sources external to the educational institution, schools and colleges are not used to promote such changes, e.g. when the industrial/commercial and business lobbies want to use the schools systems as ideological and technological agencies to provide producers and consumers deemed necessary for industrial and commercial success. <#> The present emphasis on the production of an 'enterprise culture' could be interpreted as reorientation of education in Ireland away from the broader personal, social and cultural objectives heretofore accepted as constituting the aim and purpose of education. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Access to Education </bold> </h>
 <h> 1. <it> <#> Higher Education </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Since the introduction of the 'free second-level education' scheme in the late 1960s there has been a significant increase in participation in senior second and third level education in Ireland. <#> In addition to increasing participation, there has been an increase in the variety of schools, colleges and institutes, especially at the third level. <#> The introduction of 'Distance Education' degrees (in Information Technology and in Humanities) in recent years as well as widespread availability of the British 'Open University' should, in time, increase third-level participation. <#> Table 1 shows the impact of 'free education', i.e., those under 35 years of age would have benefited from the 'O'Malley Scheme'. </p>
 <&> table </&>
 <p> <#> The figures and predictions published in the Green Paper show the extent of growth in third-level participation. <#> The numbers have increased from 21,000 in 1965 to 70,000 in 1991, i.e. an increase of 333 per cent. <#> In 1991/92 it was estimated that some 40 per cent of the age cohort attended a third-level course, half of whom are pursuing degree programmes. <#> It is further predicted that some 45 per cent of the cohort will be third-level students in the short to medium term. </p>
 <p> <#> The multiplication of third-level colleges is a 'growth industry'. <#> Validation comes generally from three sources, i.e. the N.C.E.A., the traditional universities and an arrangement with some foreign university. <#> If current trends continue, we might see competition for students and also a change in the role of the established Universities. <#> These Universities may become 'fourth-level' institutions. </p>
 <p> <#> A significant development is the growth of post-Leaving 'tertiary tops' and senior colleges, where mature students can re-enter the formal third-level system. <#> It would greatly improve our participation levels and the community relevance of the curriculum if the 'tertiary top' became the national norm. <#> By 'tertiary top' I mean that the first two years of third level studies would be organized locally, i.e. within commuter distance from all students. <#> Every major town would have one and, in co-operation with the county library system, build up an appropriate library for the general demands of the staff and students. <#> The curriculum of the post-Leaving courses should contain a balanced mix of humanities, general science and technology, organizational skills such as industrial relations and social and community studies. </p>
 <p> <#> Access to third level education is a serious issue. <#> Despite the increase in participation in second and third level education, the different social classes do not participate equally in third level education. <#> The very high student fees add to this inequality. <#> Participation in third level, although a financial issue, is also related to curriculum and second level background. <#> With the likely increase of jobs in the community services, the whole area of applied social science and community studies should elicit broader participation. <#> While the more privatized third level institutions deal with the demands of the wealthier sections, the State (with EU funding) will be the main agent of spreading equality of participation. <#> One danger of having the sons and daughters of the rich in one set of institutions is the 'old school tie' informal support network, which would militate against the poor even reaping the occupational advantages of third level participation. <quote> <#> 'Separate but equal' </quote> in third-level education may prove to be an illusion. </p>

 <h> <#> Focus on Research <#> By Michael Clancy </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Prologue </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Some years ago I visited Australia, and in the course of my travels from Perth in Western Australia right around to Rockhampton in Queensland I met many beekeepers, all of whom were most hospitable and friendly. <#> On a visit to apiaries north of Perth, I was amazed at the size of the worker bees - ""fat"" bees my Australian host called them. <#> These bees were on pollen collection at the time - early August, The beginning of the Australian Spring. <#> Later at Garton Agricultural College - now a College of Queensland University - I met Graham Kleinschmidt who told me about his work on the importance of protein in the life of the honeybees. <#> I was reminded of this work recently, when I read in an issue of the Australasian Beekeeper about the threatened closure of the internationally renowned Garton College Bee Research Centre. <#> This, then, prompted me to write about the importance of pollen for honeybees. <#> In doing so I must acknowledge how influential Australian research has been on this topic. </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> Honeybees and Pollen </h>
 <h> <#> Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The honeybee, like all other creatures, requires a balanced diet consisting of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, minerals and vitamins. <#> The honeybee, however, is unusual in two respects, viz: (a) <}> <-> it 's </-> <+> its </+> </}> two major nutrients, carbohydrates and proteins, are obtained from two different immediate sources, nectar and pollen respectively, and (b) it has a two-phasic system of digestion. <#> Carbohydrates, in the form of simple sugars, are provided by nectar and honey, and are the honeybee 's main source of energy. <#> Nectar and honey also contain very small quantities of proteins, lipids, minerals and growth factors. <#> Pollen is the honeybee 's main source of protein, lipids, minerals and vitamins. <#> Honey and pollen together provide all the nutrients, which are essential for the growth and development of the hypopharyngeal glands and the fat bodies of the winter bee <p> (1) <#> Like all living creatures, honeybees also require water. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Honeybees and Pollen </bold> ( <it> Continued </it> ) </h> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Ingestion and Digestion </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In view of the availability of both natural and substitute foods, it is worth recalling how the honeybee ingests and digests both sugars and proteins. <#> Honeybees have two different feeding behaviour patterns, which are related both to the type of food and to their nutritional requirements. </p>
 <p> <#> Honeybees, who require sugars feed on honey which they imbibe in liquid form through their extended proboscis. <#> If they food contains more than 50 <*> per cent sign </*> sugars, the honeybee dilutes it with saliva from the salivary glands of <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> head and thorax so that it will readily pass up the food canal. <#> Dry sugar is first dissolved and diluted in the same way. </p>
 <p> <#> When honeybees feed on pollen - mostly from stored material or bee bread - their behaviour is quite different. <#> The proboscis remains folded back under the head and the mandibles are used to scoop pollen from the honeycomb cell and to pass it directly into the mouth. <#> Honeybees feeding on dry pollen exhibit the same behaviour. <#> It has also been observed that when bees were given a mixture of dry sugar and pollen grains, some selected the pollen grains from the mixture with their mandibles, while other bees applied the tips of the proboscis to the sugar, imbibed the liquefied sugar and neglected the pollen. </p>
 <p> <#> Ingested food is stored in the honeycrop. <#> The two main foods, sugars and protein are separated both during storage and digestion. <#> This separation is made in the proventriculus, which has three main functions: (a) it regulates the movement of sugars back to the ventriculus, (b) it acts as a one-way valve to prevent the movement of liquid from the ventriculus forward to the crop, and (c) to remove pollen grains from the crop so that the crop contents become a clear liquid of about 40 <*> per cent sign </*> sugars. <#> These sugars are digested in the crop by enzymes secreted by the salivary glands, and which have been mixed with the food as it is ingested. </p>
 <p> <#> As pollen is filtered out of the honeycrop by the proventriculus, it accumulates in the proventricular pouches, and as each pouch is filled, the pollen grains are forced back into the ventriculus, where they are enclosed in peritrophic membranes as discrete packages. <#> The pollen is thus stored and digested over a period of several hours. <#> In this way pollen digestion is separated from sugar digestion (1). </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> The Importance of Pollen </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The importance of pollen lies in the fact that it is the honeybee 's main and natural source of protein. <#> Protein influences the rate of breeding and longevity, making pollen the single most important factor in colony development and honey production. </p>
 <p> <#> Honeybees in collecting pollen mix it with nectar or honey and saliva. <#> They add micro-organisms to start a fermentation. <#> On return to the hive this mixture is deposited in honeycomb cells, where it is layered over with honey and continues to ferment in a manner rather analogous to the ensilage of herbage. <#> This product is called bee bread and in recent times over 200 microbes had been identified in it (10). <#> Bee bread and honey are the two items of the honeybees ' stored food. <#> This hoarded food enables the honeybee colony to generate heat, rear brood and survive periods when food is not available from plants. </p>
 <p> <#> Protein from pollen is required to (a) feed larvae, (b) allow full development of young bees, and (c) repair tissue in older bees. <#> While the high protein dietary requirement for young bees and breeding is well known, the large amount used by older bees, particularly the wax producers on a heavy flow, is usually not considered and this can be a major factor in colony rundown. <#> For example the demand for protein by colonies storing quality protein. <#> Consequently, not only breeding, but the harvesting of a heavy honey flow can require a high protein input (2). </p>
 <p> <#> Estimates of the amount of pollen a honeybee may require vary considerably. <#> The amount required to rear one kg of brood varies from half a kg to one kg (3). <#> Studies in South West Queensland indicated that colonies used about 400 g pollen per week during Winter (Australian) and over 600 g per week in September (mid Australian Spring) (2). <#> No doubt these variations are confounded by variations in the quality of the pollen proteins, and because of difference in climate it would be difficult to relate these Australian observations to the Irish situation. <#> Nonetheless, it would appear that pollen requirements are greater than hitherto realised. </p>
 <p> <#> Honeybee longevity depends on the protein content of <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> body. <#> When the protein content exceeded 40 <*> per cent sign </*> , honeybees lived for 46-50 days, whereas bees below 40 <*> per cent sign </*> protein lived for 20-26 days, and the lower <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </-> </}> body protein level it took disproportionally longer for a honeybee to regain <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> body protein with good quality pollen (4). </p>
 <p> <#> In the absence of sufficient food protein, the honeybee while active will use <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> own body protein. <#> During death periods the honeybee minimises <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> body protein depletion by reducing <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> activity, breeding, foraging etc. <#> Insufficient protein during queen production can reduce queen quality and drones exposed to low protein diets can have reduced sperm counts (2). </p>
 <p> <#> Susceptibility to infectious and non-infectious diseases is another consequence of inadequate protein levels. <#> Nosema infection is a typical outcome of such poor conditions (5). </p>
 <#> <it> To be continued </it>
 <h> <bold> <#> Focus on Research </bold> by Michael Clancy </h>
 <h> <bold> Honeybees and Pollen </bold> ( <it> Continued </it> ) </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Pollen Variation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> There are wide variations in the protein content (7 - 35 <*> per cent sign </*> ) of the different types of pollen and also in their biological or food values. <#> Variety in pollen types collected by the honeybee can ensure that their food requirements are met. <#> However, pollens with less than 20 <*> per cent sign </*> protein cannot satisfy colony requirements for optimum production (2). </p>
 <p> <#> Moreover, proteins do vary very much in their food, or biological, value depending on the amount of essential amino <}> <-> a </-> </}> acids, which they contain. <#> All proteins are formed from amino acids and there are eight to ten of these amino acids, which are regarded as determining the biological value of proteins. <#> They are called essential, because as a general rule, most organisms cannot synthesise them and they must, therefore, form part of the diet. <#> The essential amino acids required by the honeybee are arginine, histidine, lysine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine, threanine, leucine, isoleucing and valine. <#> Three others (glycine, proline and serine) which are not essential for growth, exert a stimulating effect on suboptimal growth (3). </p>
 <p> <#> The absence of any one of the ten essential amino acids will have a direct effect on the development of brood, and young bee, and also on the longevity of the adult honeybee. <#> Thus, both the amount and quality of dietary protein are of the utmost importance in the optimum performance of the honeybee. </p>
 <p> <#> The honeybee does not appear to be able to distinguish between the nutritive values of various pollens and in times of pollen scarcity has been known to collect fungal spores and other non-pollens indiscriminately (6). </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Pollen Substitutes </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In view of the importance of protein in the diet of the honeybee it is not surprising that there have been many attempts to develop a pollen substitute. <#> Regretfully, research to date has not been successful and it appears that some pollen is required in artificial diets to stimulate the development of the pharyngeal glands, which secrete the protein rich ""bee milk"" (7). </p>
 <p> <#> In the introduction above, the heterogeneous nature of protein digestion is described, from with it appears that honeybee digestion favours insoluble proteins. <#> Lack of success in substitute pollens may be due to the use of soluble proteins. <#> Certainly, the value of feeding soluble amino acids, in the absence of insoluble protein, can be legitimately questioned. </p>
 <p> <#> Research to-date indicates that there is no satisfactory substitute for pollen. <#> Current thinking favours the harvesting and preservation of pollen for later bee feeding. <#> Fresh pollen is a very perishable material and it should either be carefully dried or frozen. <#> Drying must be carried out at temperatures under 45 <*> degrees sign </*> C, with a gradual removal of moisture. <#> It can then be milled to a fine powder and used as required either directly or incorporated in syrup of honey (7). <#> Alternatively, fresh pollen can be deep-frozen and is an excellent option. </p>
 <p> <#> The spread of disease, e.g. American foulbrood, is a very real possibility when feeding honeybees and particularly so in the case of pollen feeding. <#> <}> <-> protection </-> <+> Protection </+> </}> afforded by irradiating the pollen and beekeepers should check that any pollen powder or pellets they purchase is sterilised by irradiation. <#> The irradiation itself has no significant effect on the nutritional quality of the pollen - neither is irradiated pollen radioactive (7). </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Irish Pollens </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Pollen from Irish flora is likely to be of differing nutritional value to the honeybee. <#> Unfortunately, no work has been done on Irish pollen from this point of view. <#> However, there is some indication that wind-pollinated plants produce pollen of low nutritive value, while most insect-pollinated plants produce pollen which is of high value to the honeybee (1). <#> Provided that the honeybee gathers from a variety of sources there is little likelihood that pollen quality will be poor. <#> Rather, it is amount of pollen, especially in Autumn, which may be the limiting factor in colony development if not survival. <#> For this reason it would be good honeybee husbandry to set up pollen traps when pollen is plentiful. <#> The British black bee is an inveterate pollen gatherer and clogs its brood with pollen (8). <#> This behaviour leads to swarming, but this can be prevented by the use of pollen traps (9). </p>

 <h> <#> BELFAST, 1938 </h>
 <p> <#> The power went off, and as the looms ground to a halt the weavers changed their old, comfortable shoes for more serviceable ones, donned their coats and headed for the door. <#> In spite of the glass roof light being whitewashed against the glare of the sun, stifling heat still built up inside the factory and they were relieved to escape out into the fresh air. <#> One of the many mills that provided work for the people of the Falls and the Shankhill Roads, the Falls Flax Factory was situated in Cupar Street; right in the centre, at the 'T' junction where it curved sharply to the right and continued on up to the Shankhill Road to the Protestant districts, while the left-hand turn became the Kashmir Road and ran on to the Springfield Road and the Catholic districts. </p>
 <p> <#> Arm in arm with Rosaleen Magee, May Brady felt the tension ripple through her friend as they walked out of the gates on to Cupar Street. <#> She knew what was causing Rosaleen such concern, or rather who, and sure enough, there he stood, about six feet tall, jet-black hair and eyes as blue as a summer sky. <#> This was the third night he had been waiting outside the factory. <#> But for whom was he waiting? <#> Mr Blair 's secretary? <#> Yes, it must be Miss Maynard he was waiting for. <#> She was the only one May could picture him with, although May had seen and been dismayed by the look that had passed between Rosaleen and the handsome stranger on Monday night, the first he had been there. <#> She was also aware that Rosaleen had her old work coat lying open, disclosing the fact that she had taken the time to remove the overall she wore to protect her clothes when working, and May could see that she was wearing one of her better skirts and a cream-coloured blouse that was just a few weeks old; a blouse that enhanced the fairness of her skin and lightened the green of her eyes. <#> This was unusual, very unusual, because dust from the weft in the weaving shop got embedded into everything, causing a fusty smell, and it was customary to wear old clothes to work. </p>
 <p> <#> Why on earth is Rosaleen wearing her new blouse? <#> May mused. <#> Surely she did not fancy the handsome stranger? <#> A small frown puckered her brow as she pondered. <#> All the same, she must. <#> Why else risk ruining the new blouse? <#> Oh, don't be ridiculous! she admonished herself, but was unconvinced. <#> Isn't she engaged to be married? </p>
 <p> <#> Rosaleen 's thoughts were running along similar lines to May 's. <#> Why was she so aware of this man? <#> In four months ' time she would be married to Joe Smith. <#> Big, kind, handsome Joe. <#> She loved Joe. <#> So how come a single glance from a pair of blue eyes could floor her? <#> She kept her own eyes demurely downcast, but she was very much aware that the man 's eyes never left her face, bringing a bright blush to her cheeks, and that when they passed him, he turned to look after them. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""I wonder who the big hunk 's waiting for?"" </quote> May muttered, with a sidelong glance, covertly watching Rosaleen 's reaction to her words. <quote> <#> ""Probably Miss Maynard,"" </quote> she continued, and jerked her head back towards the factory. <#> <quote> ""She 's the only one in there I can picture him with. <#> I can't see <it> him </it> with a weaver or a winder."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Who are you talking about?"" </quote> Rosaleen asked, trying to appear disinterested and failing miserably. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Oh, that big, tall, handsome stranger that you never noticed,"" </quote> May answered crossly. <#> She was annoyed with Rosaleen and showed it. <#> Why couldn't she be honest and admit that she found him attractive? <#> Unless . . . surely she couldn't find him <it> that </it> attractive? <#> Oh dear God no, that would never do. <quote> <#> ""All the men around here wear Crombie overcoats and patent leather shoes that of course you wouldn't notice him."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Hot colour brightly burned in Rosaleen 's cheeks. <#> She could not understand why, but she did not want to discuss the man with May. <#> Perhaps because he affected her so deeply. <#> On Monday night she had been laughing when he had caught her eye and an electric current seemed to run like a live wire between them. <#> Time hung suspended as they gazed in awe at each other. <#> Just a few seconds, but it had filled her with rapture, and she had recaptured the feeling often in the past few days and hugged it to her. </p>
 <p> <#> Joe did not have this effect on her and she felt guilty and uneasy at her reaction to this stranger. <#> Last night and tonight she had avoided looking directly at him, scared of the effect he had on her, but she had been very much aware of his scrutiny. </p>
 <p> <#> Now she muttered. <quote> <#> ""No, you 're wrong. <#> Miss Maynard stops work at half-five so she 'll be long gone. <#> It 's not her he 's waiting for."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> May shot her a sharp glance and saw the heightened colour. <#> So, she <it> had </it> been giving him some thought and wondering who he was waiting for. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Who do <it> you </it> think he 's waiting for?"" </quote> she asked, slyly. </p>
 <p> <#> But Rosaleen was no fool. <#> She knew May 's curiosity was aroused and did not want to continue the conversation, afraid of betraying the emotions the stranger had aroused. <#> She wanted to put all thoughts of him from her mind; his obvious interest in her made her feel uncomfortable. </p>
 <p> <#> Shrugging her shoulders, she cried gaily, <quote> ""Oh, who cares?"" </quote> <#> And to change the subject, she asked, <quote> ""Are you going out tonight?"" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> She and May had been friends since their first day at primary school and only the arrival of Joe on the scene had come between them. <#> They still had one night a week out together, a Friday night, and this they spent at the Club Orchid Ballroom. <#> Joe did not like dancing but Rosaleen loved to dance and this way everybody was happy. </p>
 <p> <#> My was not hoodwinked. <#> She knew Rosaleen was deliberately changing the subject, but decided to let her get away with it. </p>
 <p> <#> She gave a deep sigh. <#> <quote> ""No, I 'm washing my hair tonight and I 've some clothes to launder."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Being the eldest child of a family of six, she preferred to launder her own clothes than have them done with the family wash. <#> Her mother was inclined to boil everything together in an old tin bucket and many a jumper and cardigan had been ruined, hence her desire to do her own laundry. <#> She envied Rosaleen, who had only one sister and who was lifted and laid by her mother. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Well, see you tomorrow."" </quote> <#> She squeezed Rosaleen 's arm before letting it go. <quote> <#> ""Don't do anything I wouldn't do."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""That gives me plenty of scope."" </quote> <#> Rosaleen retorted, with a toss of her head that sent the blonde hair swinging about her face, making May wish, not for the first time, that she was blonde and beautiful, instead of plain and mousy. </p>
 <p> <#> With a deep chuckle, she turned down Clonard Gardens which joined Clonard Street and ran down on to the Falls Road where she lived, while Rosaleen continued on up the Kashmir Road. </p>
 <p> <#> As she hurried along, her thoughts returned to the dark stranger. <#> Why did he affect her so much? <#> Chemistry, that 's what it was! <#> If they were to meet and talk they would probably bore each other to tears. <#> With this observation she relaxed and turned her thoughts to Joe. <#> Kind, handsome Joe. <#> Nothing must interfere with her plans to marry him. </p>
 <p> <#> Her first and only serious boy friend, he was a wonderful person who idolised her. <#> He had put down a deposit on a house in Iris Drive, off Springfield Avenue, and was in the process of decorating it, for them to return to after their honeymoon in Bray. <#> No greasing someone 's palm with a tenner for the key to a rented house; no for them! <#> Not every girl was lucky enough to marry a man with his own business. <#> Just a small business, dealing in wrought-iron gates and railings, but there was room for expansion, and Joe was full of plans for the future. <#> No, she would be foolish to let anything interfere with their plans. <#> Why, it was wrong even to think of another man. </p>
 <p> <#> Nevertheless, in spite of her good intentions, the minute the alarm clock shattered the silence on Thursday morning, her thoughts returned to the stranger and she jumped out of bed. <#> Dampening her hair, she rolled the long blonde strands in curlers and left it to set while she quickly washed herself down in the draughty scullery and then ate the breakfast her father prepared for her every morning. <#> Her father was a good man; there were not many like him. <#> Every morning he was downstairs first, and after lighting the fire he prepared breakfast. <#> Then, without fail, he carried a cup of tea and a round of toast upstairs to her mother, before departing for Greeves Mill where he worked in the flax store. </p>
 <p> <#> Once ready for work, with her hair swept up at the sides and hanging to her shoulders in the current page-boy style, she gave into the <}> <-> temption </-> <+> temptation </+> </}> to use a little make-up. <#> Just a little. <#> A light touch of Pan-stick and a hint of rouge. <#> She did not want May to notice and comment on it. </p>
 <p> <#> But alas, she may as well not have bothered. <#> There was no sign of the tall, handsome, stranger outside the factory gates that night and she did not know whether to be glad or disappointed. </p>
 <p> <#> On Friday morning she was pushing away at her looms, lost in thought, when Betty Devlin came and stood beside her. <#> She did not know Betty very well; a non-smoker, she did not therefore gather in the toilets where one met all the newcomers and was kept up to date on all the gossip. <#> Knocking off the handle of the loom, Rosaleen gripped the comb and helped the loom to stop more quickly. <#> Then, with a smooth, fluid movement, she exchanged the empty shuttle for a full one and set the loom in motion again, before turning to Betty, an eyebrow raised inquiringly. <#> At the same time she removed the empty bobbin from the shuttle and put a new one in from the cage of weft that sat above the loom. <#> Looms had to be kept constantly on the move or they left marks in the cloth, bringing the wrath of the examiners down on the culprit 's head. <#> So keeping an eye on the three looms, she gave half of her attention to Betty. <#> She guessed the girl was probably collecting for something; someone getting married or maybe someone retiring. </p>
 <p> <#> While Rosaleen changed the shuttle, Betty eyed her closely. <#> She had known right away who her brother was talking about when he had described her. <#> There were not many girls as lovely as Rosaleen and she could understand why her brother was attracted to her. </p>
 <p> <#> Leaning close to make herself heard above the clatter of the looms, she cried. <quote> <#> ""Did you notice a tall guy standing outside the factory a couple of nights this week?"" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> To her amusement, colour flooded Rosaleen 's face and neck. <#> Even her ears went a bright pink, causing Betty to laugh outright. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Obviously you did! <#> You and half the factory! <#> Well he was waiting for me. <#> He 's my brother Sean and he wants a word in with you."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Rosaleen found herself smiling in return. <#> It was a long time since she had heard that expression: <quote> ""Wants a word in with you"". </quote> <#> Not since she was about fifteen. <#> Still, Betty was barely sixteen, so that would account for her using the term. <#> Then the girl 's words sank in and she went redder still. <#> He wanted a date with her! </p>

 <p> <#> That sounded like boasting, but it was the truth. <#> Joe had invested a lot of money in her engagement ring, a huge solitaire. <#> She had demurred but he had said, <quote> ""May as well, while I can afford it. <#> It `s an investment, so it is. <#> A ring like that can only grow in value and . . .

 <p> <#> Deep blue eyes, just like his, laughed into Rosaleen 's. <#> Then, giving Rosaleen a wink and a nod, Betty turned and made her way down the shop floor, weaving in and out of the fast-moving machinery with graceful steps and a seductive sway to her small, neat bottom. <#> Very much aware that her progress was watched avidly by two fitters who were maintaining a loom. <#> Rosaleen watched her for some seconds, amusement in her eyes, then turned her attention back to her work, but her action were automatic, her mind full of thoughts of 'Sean'. <#> Imagine him wanting a word in with her. <#> He had a cheek all the same. <#> Sending word in like that, instead of asking her himself. <#> This thought sent dismay flooding through her. <#> What if he was outside tonight and spoke to her? <#> The very idea of it made her tremble and she chastised herself: Stop acting like a fool! <#> He means nothing to you. </p>
 <p> <#> One of the looms dwindled to a halt and when Rosaleen saw the flaw that had been caused by a broken thread, she muttered to herself as she let out the web and started to rip out the flaw. <#> That 's what you get for daydreaming. <#> Get your mind back on your work, you silly girl! </p>

 <h> <#> SEWAGE TREATMENT </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> At the outset it is important to clarify two terms, sewerage and sewage, because they are often used incorrectly. <#> Sewerage is a system of pipes used to collect and carry sewage which is the wastewater discharged from domestic premises. <#> Domestic sewage consists of human wastes, paper, vegetable matter. <#> This type of waste is organic because it consists of compounds of carbon and can be broken down by microorganisms into simpler compounds which are stable and not liable to cause a nuisance. <#> Sewage can consists of 99 <*> per cent sign </*> water and 0.1 <*> per cent sign </*> solids. </bold> </p>
 <p> <#> Besides domestic sewage there is industrial waste. <#> Many industrial wastes are also organic in composition and can be treated by microorganisms in the same way as domestic sewage. <#> This type of treatment is called biological treatment and the strength of the sewage is measured in terms of B.O.D. or biochemical oxygen demand. <#> This is a measure of the amount of oxygen used by the microorganisms in breaking down the sewage into stable compounds. </p>
 <p> <#> Thus in a town the sewerage system will collect the sewage from domestic, commercial, and industrial premises and carry it to the nearest river or to the sea. <#> The dilutions available in the receiving water has traditionally determined the extent of treatment necessary. </p>
 <h> <#> SEWAGE TREATMENT PROCESSES </h>
 <p> <#> In modern treatment works sewage goes through several stages of treatment. <bold> <#> Preliminary treatment </bold> to deal with large solids which are removed by screening or ore macerated and returned to the sewage flow. <#> At this stage grit is removed in special tanks. <#> The sewage then receives <bold> primary treatment </bold> which consists in allowing the sewage into sedimentation tanks where solids settle out in the form of sludge. <#> The next stage is <bold> secondary treatment </bold> or biological treatment in which microorganisms are used to take organic matter out of solution so as to form a sludge which can be settled out in a final settling tank. <bold> <#> Tertiary </bold> treatment can reduce the organic matter content still further if this is necessary. <bold> <#> Nutrient </bold> removal consists of reducing the phosphorus and nitrogen in the sewage so as to prevent plant growth in the receiving waters. </p>
 <h> <#> HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SEWAGE TREATMENT </h>
 <p> <#> Early attempts at treating sewage in the U.K. consisted in acquiring large farms and spreading the sewage over the land where it decayed under the action of microorganisms. <#> It was soon found that the land became 'sick' and that it was necessary to treat the sewage. <#> At first this was done by settling the sewage in concrete tanks in which the solid sewage settled out and was removed for further treatment. <#> The partially clarified liquid sewage was then passed on to the land. <#> Subsequently, chemicals such as lime were added to the settling tanks to increase the amount of solids being settled out. </p>
 <p> <#> A Royal Commission report of 1912 set a standard for the quality of treated sewage effluent before it could be discharged to rivers. <#> The standard set was that the BOD should not exceed 20mg/1 and that the suspended solids should not exceed 30mg/1. <#> These figures were recommended as a general standard and were related to situations where the receiving waters would dilute the treated effluent 8 times. <#> The standards were designed so that the BOD in the receiving waters would not exceed 4 mg/1 and thus fish could survive. <#> The limitation on suspended solids was to ensure that banks of sludge would not build up on the bed of the receiving waters. </p>
 <h> <#> BIOLOGICAL FILTERS </h>
 <p> <#> The sedimentation treatment described above even when aided by chemical treatment could not reach these standards. <#> Thus a second stage or secondary treatment was required. <#> At first secondary treatment consisted of treating the sewage on percolating filters. <#> These consisted of circular beds of stone about 1m deep over which the settled sewage was distributed by sets of rotating pipes which sprinkled the sewage over the stones. <#> Gradually a slime build up on the surface of the stones which absorbed dissolved material out of the settled sewage through microbial action and reduced the BOD of the effluent to 20mg/1. <#> As the slime built up on the stone it sheared off particularly in the spring. <#> It was necessary to trap this slime by passing the effluent from the filters through a second set of settling tanks. <#> The effluent after this secondary treatment and settlement would in general meet the required standard of 20 mg/1 for BOD and 30 mg/1 for suspended solids. </p>
 <h> <#> ACTIVATED SLUDGE </h>
 <p> <#> In 1914 a different type of secondary treatment was developed. <#> It was found by that continually aerating the effluent from the settlement tanks flocs of sludge would be formed and that they would absorb the dissolved organic matter out of the sewage in the same way as happens in the percolating filter. <#> Over the years different forms of aeration developed. <#> The retention period in these tanks was generally 8 hours and this became the conventional period for activated sludge systems. <#> The sludge from conventional activated sludge was unstable and required further treatment by digestion which will be described later. </p>
 <p> <#> Quite a number of plants with percolating filters were build in towns throughout Ireland, one of the earliest being built in Tipperary town. <#> However, the activated sludge plants were constructed because the system needed more precise control and was more suitable for a large population. </p>
 <h> <#> EXTENDED AERATION </h>
 <p> <#> In 1960 a system activated sludge based on a long period of aeration 24-36 hours was developed in Holland. <#> Aeration was carried out in a continuous ditch known as an Oxidation Ditch. <#> The method of aeration is by a horizontal shaft to which are attached a series of short paddles which dip into the sewage in the ditch. <#> On rotating the shaft the sewage is aerated and propelled around the ditch. <#> The aerated sewage is formed into a brown floc like sludge which settles out in a separate settling tank. <#> Thus clear treated effluent is drawn off the bottom of the tank. <#> The advantage of this system is that the sludge is stable and needs no further treatment except dewatering. <#> The disadvantage is that the power absorbed is high because of the long period of aerationg, thus the system is suitable for small plants of less than say 20,000 population. </p>
 <p> <#> Subsequently a similar system of extended aeration using square tanks and vertical shaft aerations have been developed. <#> These take up less space than the oxidation ditch but being deeper may be disadvantageous in bad ground conditions. </p>
 <p> <#> Since 1970 treatment plants in Ireland have been based on the extended aeration system whereas prior to that they were generally based on sedimentation and biological filtration. <#> Treatment stages typical plants are shown in figs. 1 and 2. </p>
 <p> <#> It will be noted that preliminary treatment consisting of screening and grit removal are included in both systems but that in the modern plant these are mechanised. </p>
 <p> <#> When plants serve populations greater than 20,000 population it is usual to reduce power costs by providing sedimentation (primary treatment) and biological (secondary treatment). </p>
 <h> <#> TERTIARY TREATMENT </h>
 <p> <#> If the flow in the receiving water is less than eight times the quantity of effluent then a third stage of treatment is necessary. <#> This is known as tertiary treatment and is aimed at reducing the BOD to 10 mg/1 and the suspended solids to 10 mg/1. <#> Several forms of tertiary treatment are available for example:
 <p> <#> (1) Passing the effluent over grass plots <#> (2) Retaining the effluent in lagoons <#> (3) Filtering through sand beds <#> (4) Using a bed of pebbles or wedge wire in the final settling tanks. </p>
 <p> <#> There are a few small plants in Ireland which have tertiary treatment (using the grass plot or pebble bed / wedge wire system). </p>
 <h> <#> NUTRIENT REMOVAL </h>
 <p> <#> In addition to reducing the BOD and suspended solids consideration must nowadays be given to reducing the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen in effluents. <#> These elements act as nutrients or fertilizers and when the effluent is discharged into a lake the phosphorus <}> <+> is </+> </}> discharged with the effluent. <#> This is done by adding aluminium or ferric salts to the treatment process. <#> This has the effect of causing the phosphorus to settle out of the effluent and into the sludge. <#> There are a few plants in Ireland where phosphorus removal is used, notably in Killarney, Mullingar and Castleblaney. </p>
 <p><#> Where the effluent is discharged into the sea it may be necessary to reduce the nitrate content by a process of denitrification which will reduce the nitrate content to 10 mg/1. <#> So far it hasn't been necessary to use denitrification in Ireland. </p>
 <h> <#> SLUDGE TREATMENT </h>
 <p> <#> The sludge from extended aeration plants is rendered stable by the treatment process and can be dewatered by passing it through a filter belt press thus thickening the sludge from 1 <*> per cent sign </*> solids to 15 or 20 <*> per cent sign </*> solids. <#> The sludge can then be mixed with domestic refuse on a tiphead. <#> The sludge from primary settling tanks is unstable and needs further treatment by digestion in closed tanks. <#> This is known as anaerobic sludge digestion and can be carried out in unheated tanks or in heated tanks. <#> When the tanks are heated the methane gas which is formed can in turn be used to fuel burners which keeps the tanks heated. </p>
 <p> <#> Another form of sludge treatment is composting. <#> This consists of mixing the sludge with straw of lime and cement kiln dust. <#> The sludge will heat up and kill <}> <-> of </-> <+> off </+> </}> microorganisms. <#> This system has been used in the USA and on the continent and and has recently been introduced into the North of Ireland. </p>
 <p> <#> The final disposal of sewage sludge can be by a number of routes
 <p> <#> (1) Disposal on agricultural land <#> (2) Co-disposal with domestic refuse on a landfill site <#> (3) Disposal in the sea <#> (4) Incineration </p>
 <p> <#> The disposal of sludge to agricultural land is controlled by EC directive No. 86/278/EEC. <#> This requires that the sludge, unless it is injected or ploughed immediately into the soil, must undergo biological, chemical or heat treatment, long term storage on any other appropriate process. </p>
 <p> <#> The object of this treatment is to kill off disease causing organisms which may be in the sludge. <#> These restrictions are difficult to meet in the case of small plants and the amount of sludge used in agriculture has declined in favour of co-disposal with domestic refuse in landfill sites. </p>
 <p> <#> Disposal of sludge at sea is only practised in the case of Dublin and it has been decided to phase this out. </p>
 <p> <#> Incineration is only suitable for large populations and the system is not used in Ireland. </p>
 <p> <#> Earlier incinerators proved very expensive to operate and for this reason many of the plants built in other countries have been abandoned. <#> In more recent years a new form of incinerator has been developed based on the use of a fluidised bed which it proving more successful. </p>
 <h> <#> SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT FACILITIES IN IRELAND </h>
 <p> <#> At present approximately 66 <*> per cent sign </*> of the population live in towns and are connected to sewers. <#> The remainder live in rural areas, and it is impractical to connect them to sewers. <#> These houses are served by septic tanks. </p>
 <p> <#> The number and capacity of the sewage treatment plants in the Republic of Ireland are shown in Table 1. </p>
 <p> <#> Most Irishtowns are located around the coast, and by far the largest of these is Dublin, with 920,000 inhabitants. <#> The sewage from 600,000 of these receives primary treatment and there are two sea outfalls which serve 260,000 and 60,000 people. </p>
 <p> <#> 47 other towns around the coast discharge untreated sewage to estuaries or coastal waters, and only 11 coastal towns have primary or secondary treatment. <#> There are 68 towns which discharge to inland waters. <#> These are towns between 1,000 and 20,000 inhabitants and the majority of these have now full secondary treatment. </p>
 <p> <#> The Environment action programme announced by the Minister for the Environment in January 1990, provides for the elimination of untreated discharges from major coastal towns at an estimated cost of <*> pound sign </*> 400 million and from inland towns at an estimated cost of <*> pound sign </*> 230 million by the year 2000. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> STEP BY STEP THROUGH THE TEST </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The diagram shows the main points an examiner looks out for. <#> They are not necessarily in order as it will depend on the examiner on the day and the direction he chooses to take. <#> However, you may use it as a guide to the amount you will have to do on the day. </p>
 <p> <#> The diagram on page 17 is based on a category B driving test (see page 12) which lasts about 45 minutes. <#> Other categories may well last longer (see HGV, page 102). </p>
 <p> <#> Do not overlook the minutes of relaxation after your driving test as you will have been stressed throughout that period. <#> Rest for several minutes before returning to the road. <#> This will have a calming down effect immediately after your test. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> General procedure on the day of the test </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Arrive at the test centre at least 10 minutes prior to your appointed time. <#> You should wait in the waiting room and let the receptionist know you are there. <#> Your name will be called in due course. </p>
 <p> <#> The initial part will start after you produce your current Irish provisional licence to the examiner and sign the required administration forms including a Declaration of Road Worthiness and Insurance (see page 19). <#> The Questions and Answers part of the examination should then take place, after which you will be asked to identify some road traffic signs. </p>
 <p> <#> You will then accompany the examiner to the vehicle where he/she will check your tax and insurance disc and inspect your L plates (front and rear) and generally check the condition of your vehicle. <#> In the case of a HGV, the examiner will check the lights, indicators, stop lights and generally all electrics, not forgetting the minimum number of mirrors, one left and one right. <#> Before moving away, your examiner will say words to this effect: <quote> ""There should be no further conversation in the vehicle between you and me other than to tell you to turn right or left. <#> In the absence of a right or a left, I would like you to assume straight. <#> If, however, you don't understand, you may ask and I will repeat."" </quote> <#> Don't be unduly worried about this, as it is all part of the test. <#> Try not to be put off by his/her presence in the vehicle. <#> Your examiner may take notes during your diving test. <#> Do not be alarmed at this as it is normal procedure. <#> If you show that you are a competent and confident driver you should pass your test. <#> Remember your training! </p>
 <p> <#> He/she will ask you to move away and take whatever direction the examiner has planned. <#> You will be asked to go right or left. <#> For the most part, a high percentage of examiners will ask you to do a turnabout as a first manoeuvre, followed shortly by a reverse into a limited opening on the left. <#> This is almost certainly followed by arm/handsignals and finally a hill start. <#> This may not be the exact sequence in your test centre, as this will depend on the number of examiners working from the test centre on that day and on the obstructions and traffic within the areas intended for your manoeuvres. </p>
 <p> <#> Your test route will be a well balanced drive including moving away, right turns, left turns, driving along main roads, emerging at junctions, traffic lights, use of traffic lanes, road position, use of controls, mirrors and signals. <#> And remember general observation will play a very big part in your test. </p>
 <p> <#> Almost before you know it, you will be on the way back to the test centre. <#> You will have been concentrating so much, you will wonder where the time went! </p>
 <p> <#> Examiners are not normally allowed to speak to you during your test. <#> Most examiners will not do so. <#> This is because it is felt that it would impair your concentration. <#> In fact, many an examiner has been reprimanded for trying to calm a person down or for trying to help them relax. <#> Complaints have been known to be made when such situations have occurred, this is why the rule now rigidly applies. </p>
 <p> <#> On your return to the test centre, you will accompany the examiner into the centre where you will be informed whether you gained your Certificate of Competency or not. <#> Examiners are not allowed to discuss the reasons for failing (see page 68 on the K Form). <#> A very high percentage of failures are due to three main reasons: <#> 1. faults relating to vehicle control and road procedure <#> 2. lack of professional tuition <#> 3. incorrect observation </p>
 <p> <#> Remember, nerves alone should not bring about a refusal of a Certificate of Competency. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> General points - Rules of the Road </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Study the Rules of the Road handbook as this book, <it> The Driving Test in Ireland, </it> is not meant to replace the one which is issued by the National Safety Council for the Minister of the Environment. </p>
 <p> <#> The contents of this government handbook are tested orally at the Questions and Answers part of the test. <#> It is indeed recommended that a person who has passed the driving test should periodically read the latest edition, as new laws, regulations and EC directives are introduced all the time. </p>
 <p> <#> You should be able to answer questions in your own words. <#> You should know all the warning signs: regulatory and informative, road signs and road markings. <#> A key factor in answering any question on the Rules of the Road would be to think of the safety aspect first. <#> Although this book refers a lot to the ""Driving test"", it must go without saying that ""test standard"" is a good standard to maintain for the rest of your life. <#> Never think, ""I have to drive like this for a test"" and the next day forget all you have been taught. <#> Your life could depend on the good habits acquired under the guidance of your driving instructor! </p>

 <h> <bold> <ul> <#> Control Procedure </bold> </ul> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> COCKPIT DRILL </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The proper procedure should be to demonstrate to the examiner the use of the normal everyday pre-start checks. </p>
 <#> D/S/S/S/M
 <p> <bold> <#> Doors: </bold> <#> Make sure all doors are properly closed. </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Seats: </bold> <#> Properly adjusted, mainly to suit your clutch control as this pedal is generally the only one that reaches the floor. </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Steering: </bold> <#> Allow the back of your seat to be sufficiently forward for your arms not to have to stretch. <#> A proper position would be with the elbows bent. </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Seat belts: </bold> <#> Make sure you have placed your seat belts flat across your body with no twist as this could have the effect of a knife 's edge in the case of a sudden stop. </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Mirrors: </bold> <#> Ensure that all available mirrors are adjusted to suit you and are kept clean at all times. <#> Adjust inside mirror by using the top and bottom of the mirror base, without touching the glass itself. </p>
 <h> <bold> <ul> <#> USE OF CONTROLS </bold> </ul> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Accelerator </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> You should be able to operate it smoothly and sensibly. <#> Never accelerate too fast for the conditions you are driving in. <#> This is for control reasons, not to mention the cost factor in doing so as the harsher the acceleration/deceleration is, the more fuel you use.</p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Footbrake </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> You should be able to stop smoothly, effectively and without jerking, except in an emergency. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Clutch </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> You should be able to operate your clutch smoothly, know your 'biting point' (gripping point) and use only when required. <#> When finished using the clutch, remove your foot completely from the pedal as a partially depressed clutch will burn out the clutch. <#> You should be able to coordinate the clutch with the handbrake and accelerator when moving off from a stationary position and when on a hill. <#> Do not coast to a stop, that is to say, do not travel with your clutch depressed for an distance greater than necessary. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Steering </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Keep both hands on the wheel at all times except when operating a control or giving a signal. <#> Your hands should be level on the wheel i.e. ten to two or a quarter to three (clock face position). <#> This is the best operating position for the pull/push movement which is recommended. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Horn </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Many people are reluctant to use the horn during a driving test when in fact, at times, it is imperative. <#> For instance, it could be recommended to attract the attention of a pedestrian who is about to step onto the road in front of you and who, you feel, is not aware of you presence, or in a sharp turn where visibility is limited or obscured. </p>
 <p> <#> These are just two instances. <#> However, normal use of this instrument should not be excessive or aggressive. </p>
 <p> <#> One should also note that between the hours of 11.30 pm (23.30) and 7.00 am (07.00), the horn should not be used except for a traffic emergency. </p>

IrishEnglish,must,Another question which arises in one 's mind was the number of skilled craftsmen who must have been there to build such splendid edifices,epistemic,epistemic,deontic,<W2F-015$A>,"
 <p> <#> Among places of enchantment were the woods, with their laurel, chestnut and hazelnut groves. <#> Each season brought its own magic to the woods. <#> Building tree houses in the lushness of summer, gathering conkers in the multicoloured autumn, wandering through the scented bluebells and wild garlic in May and collecting holly and ivy in the cold, bare woods at Christmas time, were some of the seasonal variations of activity. <#> Born by the sea, one never loses the sound of the sea and the majestic Shannon estuary at Tarbert was a continual fascination in a whole variety of ways. <#> There was swimming in the favoured spots such as Rusheen, Wall 's Bay, the Slatey Pier, the Island and the Back-o-the-hill. <#> There was fishing from the pier and on ""The Bank"". <#> Periwinkles, bornachs and mussels were in profusion and unpolluted along the shores. <#> The tides came and went in ceaseless motion, ships plied up and down the river, and the curlews, seagulls, swans and widgeon brought the reed-fringed mudflats and creeks to life. <#> Tarbert Island with its lighthouse, battery coastguard station and gantry brought <it> Treasure Island </it> and <it> Coral Island </it> close to home, and bands of cowboys and Indians, or hordes of cops and robbers worked out their fantastical games in-and-out through the ruins. </p>
 <p> <#> In April and May the boglands called for the turf-cutting, and through the summer they spread their splendour of bog-cotton, heathers, furze and many-coloured mosses to enchant the eye. <#> The cutting and saving of hay, with a heavy reliance on manual skill and horse power, had fun as well as work attached to it. <#> The satisfaction of leaving a wyned meadow in the evening sun, with the aroma of freshly saved hay in the nostrils, stays as a haunting memory. </p>
 <p> <#> There was no time for boredom, the word was never used. <#> There were many hunts - rabbits, hares, foxes and the occasional badger hunt. <#> The ""horse-park"" was the mecca for groups of young and established football players in the evenings as aspiring youngsters tried to imitate their heroes. <#> The year was <}> <-> pun- ctuated </-> <+> punctuated </+> </}> with a variety of activities and events which were very congenial to youngsters. <#> The great carnivals, which drew huge crowds of all ages to the village, were held in August. <#> The fancy dress parades were highly elaborate and imaginative. <#> It took a couple of hours for all the sections of the parade, from individuals to large groups, to pass through the crowds lining the streets. <#> Horses, tractors and lorries were used by the larger groups for their colourful presentations. <#> Regattas with their boat races, swimming races, greasy poles and pillow fights, brought great excitement to the island. <#> Matches in football tournaments drew large partisan audiences. <#> At night the pubs resounded to laughter, songs, music and arguments. <#> There was no consciousness of a generation gap in the dancers who thronged the marquee. <#> The carnivals may not have had the flamboyance and exhilaration of a mardi gras, but they had as much vitality as an Irish community could give them. <#> Other summer occasions were marked in different ways, for instance, May Eve was treated with a sense of unease and respect. <#> The summer tree (sycamore) was brought into the houses, and whispers were made of the ""piseogs"" which could be perpetrated on that evening, which retained vestiges of old pagan folk memory. <#> The old festival of mid-summer was also marked by the mighty bonfires on the Market Road on St. John 's night, for which materials were gathered evenings in advance. <#> We danced and played as the flames and sparks went higher in the night sky, giving us feelings, at once, of both fascination and dread. </p>
 <p> <#> The autumn evenings were marked by the Listowel races, the All-Ireland final and the Glin Coursing. <#> As altar boys we visited the houses throughout the parish for the stations in the mornings, and attended at the October rosary and benedictions in the evenings. <#> These led on to Halloween, with the excitement of ""high-fiddles"", snap apple, Halloween games and blind-man 's-buff. <#> The abundance of apples, nuts and barmbracks were consumed with relish. </p>
 <p> <#> Christmas, of course, was special in the village, as everywhere else. <#> Many of us, however, preferred the activity of Stephen 's Day to the quiet atmosphere of Christmas Day. <#> Groups of us gathered and tramped the countryside with the Wren-boys, generally being warmly welcomed and well-treated in the houses which dotted the landscape. <#> Trudging home from the hills of Ballygaughlin, with lights and Christmas candles lighting the dark, and with many days of Christmas holidays stretching ahead, was a good feeling. <#> New Year 's Eve was a special night in the village when crowds gathered in torchlight procession, with accordions and bodhr&/ans bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the new. <#> The music, dancing and songs carried on in the village square into the early hours. </p>
 <p> <#> At other times, the village was entertained by the sounds and smells of the animals, which were part of the agricultural economy of the region. <#> The cattle fairs, bull-tests and pig sales brought varied activity to delight youngsters. <#> The great social occasion of the creamery, particularly on summer mornings, created a buzz of activity and conversation in the village, and also brought town and country close together. <#> The forge with its sizzling fire and sound of the anvil also brought town and country and hedgehogs together, as youngsters vied to blow the large bellows to redden the blacksmith 's horseshoes. </p>
 <p> <#> The carpenter 's shop with its resin-smelling ringlets of shavings was also a place of delights. <#> The whine of the great saws mingled with the carpenter 's hammer blows, as cradles, coffins, carts and crates were fashioned. <#> Nearby was the parish hall which housed the billiards club, the hops and the whist drives for the older groups. </p>
 <p> <#> The school, for good or ill, is the institution which has a vast range of influences upon us when we are young. <#> Many experiences <}> <-> occured </-> <+> occurred </+> </}> there with life enhancing as well as debilitating effects, but which stay with us to the grave. <#> In our time the tolling of the church bell for mass, angelus, or funeral was close to us in the school. <#> In the church the great events of Catholic life - baptism, confirmation, marriage and funeral - were conducted and, to the eyes of us altar boys, had an interesting ritual about them, if also tinged with trepidation at times. <#> The primary school had been built in 1869 and was strictly segregated between boys and girls. <#> Facilities were rather spartan, and the large rooms depended on the quality of the turf, brought by children 's parents, for the open fires. <#> Discipline tended to be on the <quote> ""spare the rod, spoil the child"" </quote> principle, with catechism class particularly fraught with anxiety. <#> For some of us, practice with the mouthorgan band brightened the rather narrow curricular range, which was based primarily on English, Irish and Arithmetic, with a welcome dimension of History and Geography added. </p>
 <p> <#> A minority of pupils went on to secondary school in the nearby St. Ita 's. <#> This was one of the small lay, co-educational secondary schools to be found, fairly regularly, in Kerry and Limerick at the time. <#> The founder of the school, Miss McKenna, was a noted educationalist who set high standards as the norm, particularly in her specialist subjects, English and French. <#> She and her team opened up for us teenagers the richness of new languages, great literatures, mathematics and so on. <#> It was also an era in which the competition for the public examinations was much less intense than to-day. <#> Pupils cycled and bussed from nearby townlands and villages to the school. </p>
 <p> <#> We were always conscious that most parents took schooling seriously, and one took for granted a regard for learning, which was part of the tradition of the region. <#> Both the national and secondary schools bore witness to the long-term impact, which gifted teachers can have, on the attitudes and outlook of youngsters in their formative years. <#> Since that time the ""school on the hill"" has been replaced by a splendid comprehensive school, and it is gratifying to know that the traditions of good schooling and scholarship are alive and well in that corner of north Kerry. </p>
 <p> <#> The forties and fifties were decades of economic depression, and many families suffered from the deprivations of real poverty. <#> Employment, other than in agriculture, was very rare and emigration was the lot of many. <#> It was sad to see so many of one 's school pals gathering at the corner to catch the bus to Limerick and be on their way to England. <#> To get there, they were often aided by the allowances gained on F.C.A. training camps. <#> It was the scarcity of money which acted as a constraining and blighting force on many people. <#> The fabric of community life was maintained and, often, the very poor did not allow their material impoverishment to quench the spirit of their personalities. <#> To a degree the old proverb <&Irish> ""Ar sc&/ath a ch&/eile a mhaireann na daoine"" </&Irish> was borne out, and various quiet forms of assistance were available. <#> Nevertheless, life, in general, was affected by the lack of a employment for the people of the area. <#> Even as a youngster, one was conscious of this overlay of economic hard-times, and despite the richness of aspects of community life, the potential of many individuals was not realised. </p>
 <p> <#> A striking feature of this community life was the respect for individuals, the tolerance for eccentricities and a regard for the ""characters"". <#> People were known for particular songs, or yarns, experiences or skills. <#> This I have found to be a strong feature of life in Kerry, but, no doubt, is not <}> <-> inique </-> <+> unique </+> </}> to it. <#> There is, however, a delight in difference, a pleasure in language usage and a regard for the individual experience, which <}> <-> ia </-> <+> is </+> </}> a valuable feature of life there. </p>
 <h> <it> <#> Old Glories Reflected in Stone </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Among many features one would like to dwell on, I will touch on one which struck me very forcibly, as a young person, but which was not much mentioned - Tarbert 's walls. <#> To a youngster 's eye in the forties and fifties there was very little industrial or commercial employment in the village, but all around one were mighty walls and large buildings which spoke to one of a different era, a bygone era in a Tarbert which must have been very different. <#> They stood silent as sentinels and witnesses of a Tarbert which must have been more vibrant. <#> They symbolised an era when there must have been great collective endeavour. <#> The question arose as to what had happened in old <}> <-> Tabert </-> <+> Tarbert </+> </}> that left us so many monuments in stone, which seemed out of keeping with the community 's character at the time one was growing up. <#> Only communities with a sense of confidence, of collective purpose and of optimism built on a grand scale, and such optimism was foreign to the decades of the forties and fifties. <#> Another question which arises in one 's mind was the number of skilled craftsmen who must have been there to build such splendid edifices. <#> The scale of the building projects would have required a whole sophisticated culture in crafts, but particularly in stone masonry. <#> When I looked at skilled masons in our time, they seemed to be the inheritors of this older tradition. <#> As well as the scale of the buildings and the remaining walls of greater edifices, one was also struck by the beauty of the stone itself and by the skill and sense of pride which exuded from the workmanship. </p>
 <p> <#> The surviving evidence went back to the medieval times as evidenced in Kilnaughtin Church and Lislaughtin Abbey. <#> In the latter, the beauty of the dovetailing of the flat river stones with the shaped limestone of sedilia and lintel windows has been beautifully caught by the Polish artist Ursula Ratzlaff O'Carroll. </p>

IrishEnglish,could,Back at the first pillar I asked the man if I could have a sample spud,concessive,epistemic,dynamic,<W2F-017$A>,"
 <h> <#> Born in a Market Place </h>
 <h> <it> <#> Bryan MacMahon </h> </it>
 <p> <#> I was four years of age when, taken by the hand, I was led down to our newly built house in Market Street. <#> As the name of the street implies, our back gate now opened onto the marketplace itself; standing on the ""keepstone"" on which the two parts of the backgate were anchored I peeped out through a bolthole perhaps six inches square and found myself gazing into a new and magical world - the world of the market. </p>
 <p> <#> To make it more personal, my grandfather, old Pat MacMahon, was weighmaster and was thus in charge of the place. <#> He must have been a tenacious old man, for, refusing to have soldiers of the empire billeted upon his home, he was deprived of his licence as a publican and was later fortunate enough to be appointed to the post he then held. </p>
 <p> <#> The marketplace branded me for life. <#> It was thronged with country-folk almost every day of the week. <#> When it wasn't a calf market, it was a pig market or a butter market: on Fridays it was the country produce market - perhaps the most exciting day of all. </p>
 <p> <#> The cattle fairs were held in the adjoining streets- directly under my bedroom window as well as in the broad Square. <#> On the occasion of the Old or Big Fairs they spilled into the other streets of the town. <#> There were times when I awoke at daybreak to hear the sound of hooves under my window and to realize that a horse fair was in progress. <#> Donkeys, mules and jennets were also bought and sold on these occasions: these provided a plebeian counterpoint to the three-quarter bred horses destined for the hunting field. <#> The <}> <-> amoniac </-> <+> ammoniac </+> </}> smell of horse droppings and cowdung lingers in the recesses of my nose to this day. </p>
 <p> <#> So I became acquainted with all aspects of country life as seen through the glass of the market. <#> The place had marvellous ancillary goods and produce for sale at its gates and archways. <#> Scollops or thatching withies, eelfry, cockles sold by the fluted pint glass, salmon, beef sold by the yard and hung on a steelyard or ""stiller"" to be weighed, periwinkles and seagrass. </p>
 <p> <#> There were innocent looking churns which looked as if they contained ""home"" or sour milk for pot-oven baking, but when the cover was removed - this when the whole area was cautiously surveyed - the vessels were seen to be three quarters full of sea trout or, as we called them, ""white"" trout known in Irish as <&Irish> ""liath&/ain"" </&Irish> or grey trout. <#> The net used for killing these fish was called the <&Irish> ""Cauteen"" </&Irish> and it had a finer mesh than the net used for salmon - indeed it was sometimes slipped inside the main net for the purpose of holding the smaller fish. </p>
 <p> <#> As the Friday produce market drew near I was often deputed to purchase the vegetables for the week or month as the case may be. <#> Buying these in bulk was buying at cost and always proved to work out far cheaper than the price obtaining in the shops. <#> My main commission was to buy a sack of potatoes. <#> I was warned to purchase only those that were balls of flour when boiled - and certainly not those which turned out like bars of soap. <#> An error in this regard was reckoned a calamity. <#> I was seven or eight years of age at the time. <#> I thought of a cunning plan to ensure success on every occasion. </p>
 <p> <#> I faced the crowded market. <#> The potato sacks with their owners were ranked against the pillars of the Market sheds. <#> I strolled along the file of vendors, my attention focused on the men from the seashore - this because potatoes from the sandy soil with seaweed as its manure were reputed to be far better for eating than those produced on cutaway bog. <#> As I went I picked up spent matches from the ground. </p>
 <p> <#> Back at the first pillar I asked the man if I could have a sample spud. <#> The sack was open and a boiled floury potato offered as example of the finished product. <#> Taking a sample from deep in the sack I marked it as No.1 by sticking a single match into it. <#> Second pillar, the sample was marked by two matches and so on down the line until No.10 which looked weird with ten matches sunk deep into its flesh. <#> This concluded my sampling. <#> I slipped in home then and boiled my store of spuds. <#> Ah, No. 6 was a beauty! <#> I went back to the market and bought No.6 sack. </p>
 <p> <#> Not bad for a cute Kerry lad of seven! </p>
 <p> <#> I must mention the shawls worn by the farmwives and others: as I recall it the mingling of these coloured garments strengthened the impression that, when one was in the market, one was also in a near-Eastern bazaar. </p>
 <p> <#> The wives of the ""strong"" farmers wore capacious biscuit-coloured woollen shawls each with a delightful hem of tassels and ornamental thread-work in various colours. <#> The quality of the garment - its opulence at times - offered a clue as to how many milch cows were on the husband 's farm. <#> Acreage offered a misguided measure, for a farm was then adjudged by such sayings as <quote> ""He has the grass of sixty cows"" </quote> or <quote> ""She took in a fortune of <*> pound sign </*> 2,000 to that place"". </quote> <#> There was also an implicit distinction made between arable and bogland; this distinction was clarified when the grazing of a cow was mentioned. <#> ""Turbary"" or the right to cut turf on certain defined areas of bogland was also an added bonus relied upon at times of sale, purchase or the making of matches. </p>
 <p> <#> As boys we treated those glorious shawls with scant if not impious attention. <#> Stationing ourselves in church directly behind a pair of similarly attired matrons we tied the tassels of adjoining shawls together with ""black"" or firm knots. <#> When the women parted company at the end of Mass and made to move off in different directions in the church aisle their tugging pulled the shawls off each others ' heads, so that the cursory attire beneath was in each case exposed to a <}> <-> mercilous </-> <+> merciless </+> </}> public gaze. <#>
 <p> <#> There were other shawls in the marketplace. <#> Fishwomen from Tralee who sold cockles from wicker baskets, wrapping them in clutches of newsprint, wore dark chocolate coloured shawls while our own women from the thatched cottages of the town wore plain black shawls. <#> <}> <-> Swopped </-> <+> swapped </+> </}> over backyard walls to attend the earliest Sunday masses the shawls allowed housewives to attend service anonymously and without the trouble of dressing up. <#> A single eye seen in the upper triangle of the shawl often gave a keen observer a clue as the identity of the woman behind this Irish yashmak. </p>
 <p> <#> But for me the most attractive shawl of all was the green and black paisley shawl worn by the women from the other side of the Ferry, that is south of the River Feale and west to the Shannon mouth. <#> ""Mahera"" we called that area. <#> The old saying <quote> ""Marry a Mahera woman and you marry Mahera"" </quote> gave some indication of its clannishness. <#> For me this shawl conveyed an impression mingled of faction fighting, (The Cooleens versus the Mulvihills), hurling - (Ballyduff had already won Kerry 's one and only All-Ireland Senior Hurling title) lovely loam, a Round Tower, and the net fisherman of the Cashen estuary with their unusual boats called ""ganelows"" - probably a corruption of gondola. </p>
 <p> <#> All this vanished world, as evoked by the green and black shawl, I experience again on visiting a folk and general museum perched high above the Cashen fishing village, a place familiar to the thousands of visitors to Ballybunion during the summer season. </p>
 <p> <#> The marketplace was then shot through with the idealism of freedom; balladsingers, each with his swatch of rebel songs, moved through the throngs. <#> (Later, I wrote many of those ballads for my friend the printer.) <#> The muttering about grabbed farms and rural boycotts were background music to the shouting of castclothes men with their marvellous rhetoric and the land-hungry cry of <quote> ""The land for the people and the road for the bullock."" </quote> <#> The accessories for the carts were versatile - the creel or rail for bonnavs, turf or turnips, the seat-and-guards for travelling to town or even to Mass, the low box for carrying sand or gravel while the bare cart itself was capable of being loaded with stable manure or a piled array of sacks of various kinds. <#> The vehicles were locally called Scotchcarts as opposed to the <quote> ""tumbler from up the country"" </quote> or even the ""slide"" used in the Dingle area for bringing down turf saved on the mountain flank. </p>
 <p> <#> The colour of the carts was a brilliant orange red with the shaft ends tipped with black: each one had the name of its owner and his townland print-painted in black at the point where the right shaft met the body of the vehicle. <#> I came to know of every townland and of almost every family within thirty miles of my town as a result of perusing these inscriptions. <#> I even made a collection of the townland names, querying the former owner as to where it was situated and more importantly still, the meaning of the Irish version of the name. </p>
 <p> <#> The butter market was something I was deeply involved in. <#> As my father 's health waned he gave up his law office post and took to buying butter for export, working hand in hand with his brother who was a creamery manager. <#> The butter borer used for testing the country butter took my attention. <#> I learned to insert it in the butter pile, spin it full circle, extract it, smell the butter, bite a chunk of it, roll it round in the mouth as if testing wine, uplift one 's judicious eyes to the heavens, spit it out at a certain place in the yard and finally offer a grudged grunt of approval of its merits. </p>
 <p> <#> If my grandfather reigned over this colourful kingdom I was often his viceroy. <#> This was when the market was quiet and my grandsire and one of his cronies stole off for a pint. <#> I was then left in charge of the place. <#> I directed horseloads onto the weighbridge, weighed them, issued a ticket and later deducted the tare or weight of the unladen vehicle. <#> I progressed so far in my avocation that I could look at a sack of potatoes and tell almost to the pound how much it weighed. <#> I was then about nine or ten years of age. </p>
 <p> <#> There was always a double line of horse rails of turf just inside the market gate - a point which was a fruitful source of interest to me. <#> Sometimes I 'd find a dead hare hanging from the willow fork which kept the creel in place. <#> The hare was for sale, of course, but I 'd ask for, and was given, the tail. <#> It was easy to bargain with the turfsellers on a rainy day as our yard was on the market and the seller sold the turf at a reduced price so as to enable him to go home quickly. <#> I came to know at a glance from which of the many bogs of North Kerry any particular creel of turf came and thus could size up its heating qualities at a glance. </p>
 <p> <#> There was one particular turfman who got the better of me in repartee. <#> When I countered his asking a certain price for his load by saying <quote> ""I could buy a few hundred-weights of good English coal for that"" </quote> he said quietly, <quote> ""Do you know what Dean Swift said about that?"" </quote> <quote> <#> ""I don't remember,"" </quote> I said. <quote> <#> ""He advised the Irish people to burn everything English except their coal."" </quote> <#> After that I always called the man Dean Swift and never after bargained with him about the price of his turf. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Ballybrit defies the odds with <*> pound sign </*> 1.5m. a day gambling spree </bold> </h>
 <h> <ul> <#> BY Ciaran Tierney </ul> </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> Any talk of recession has been banished from the Ballybrit area this week as huge crowds once again flocked to the annual Galway Races . . . with <*> pound sign </*> 1.5million a day being wagered on the course. </bold> </p>
 <p> <it> <#> With the usual gaggle of celebrities, politicians, serious punters, and tricksters, rubbing shoulders with ordinary racing enthusiasts, the annual festival retained its unique atmosphere, with the fine weather of the past two afternoons ensuring bumper crowds again at the race course. </it> </p>
 <p> <#> Aggregate Tote figures have been down each day on last year 's record figures, but it 's been a very successful race meeting with huge sums of money changing hands on the course over the four days so far. </p>
 <p> <#> Indeed, the Galway Races have proved once again that they are virtually recession-proof by managing to attract big crowds once again despite a summer which has seen a significant slump in the number of Irish tourists visiting the West on short breaks, due to the poor weather experienced since May. </p>
 <p> <#> The crowds were down a little on previous years for Wednesday 's Galway Plate but, whether it was the Guinness Hurdle or Ladies Day that attracted them, punters certainly thronged the course yesterday. </p>
 <p> <#> Tote figures for both of the main days, Wednesday and Thursday, have been down considerably on last year - but those in the know have discounted this as a significant trend as bookmakers on the site pulled in over <*> pound sign </*> 1 million in bets on both days. </p>
 <p> <#> Wednesday 's Tote aggregate was <*> pound sign </*> 441,465, down almost <*> pound sign </*> 42,000 on 1992, while yesterday 's aggregate rose to <*> pound sign </*> 489,233, which was down <*> pound sign </*> 64,672 on last year. <#> But with the bookies estimated to have handled approximately two and a half times the amount gambled with the Tote there was no shortage of money in circulation. </p>
 <p> <#> Racecourse manager John Moloney said this morning that he was very happy with the week 's returns so far - and he underplayed the decreases in the Tote aggregates by pointing out that last year 's record figures were due to the fact that the Tote jackpots were carried over from day to day. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""We have been very lucky with the weather and Wednesday and Thursday were two wonderful days here,"" </quote> he said. <quote> <#> ""The crowds have held up this year, even though Monday was wet and Tuesday windy. <#> And I would discount the decreases in the Tote, as there was a huge carry-over last year, while the bookmakers on the site have taken in over <*> pound sign </*> 1m both on Wednesday and yesterday (Thursday)."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Some pundits joked that a full Cabinet meeting could have been held in the vicinity of Ballybrit earlier this week as there were so many Government Ministers in attendance, including An Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, the Minister for Finance, Bertie Ahern, and Galway 's Minister for justice, Maire Geoghegan Quinn. </p>
 <p> <#> Other well-known personalities to grace Ballybrit with their presence this week included Paul Hill of the Guildford Four and his American wife, Courtney Kennedy; former Miss Ireland Michelle Rocca; and Alan Sugar, the man who owns top English soccer team Tottenham Hotspur, who made the headlines in the Spring when he sacked popular club manager Terry Venables.</p>
 <p> <#> The pattern at Ballybrit, where the crowds are holding up even if there seems to be less cash flowing around, mirrors the pattern for tourism in the West of Ireland this summer. </p>
 <p> <#> According to Regional Tourism Manager Brian Flynn the tourism market has held up pretty well even if there are decreases in some sectors, with the bad weather of the past few months in particular to blame for the slump in the number of Irish tourists visiting the region. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""It is very hard to judge crowds of people and whether they vary or not from year to year,"" </quote> he said yesterday. <quote> <#> ""But our business here is certainly as busy as last year. <#> From the races we are getting a feedback that people are more cautious with their money this year and the spending sprees don't seem to be there, even if the numbers have held up this year."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> He said that the numbers of European and British tourists, and returning emigrants, had held up pretty well or even increased this year, but there was a marked decline in the number of visitors from the home market - with the weather a factor in the reluctance of Irish people to take holidays at home this year. </p>
 <p> <#> Mr. Flynn pointed out that there was a phenomenal growth in tourism between 1988 and last year, and Ireland West Tourism expected to record a modest growth this year. </p>

 <p> <#> The allegations that <quote> ""the project managers have behaved in an arrogant and unhelpful way"" </quote> is completely without foundation and is totally rejected. <#> At all times the public 's queries and concerns have been dealt with courteously and efficiently. <#> It has been our objective from the commencement of planning of this project to inform the public to the best of our abilities and also to ascertain their concerns so that the E.I.S. can be as broad and effective as possible. <#> I must note however that the ""project managers"" have had to endure abuse and invective of an extreme nature from certain parties opposed to the project. <#> The opposition in some areas is of such a hostile nature that Dublin Corporation senior personnel, and the Consultants Geoconsult - Arup, were forced to withdraw from one public meeting, such was the level of abuse that they were being subjected to. </p>
 <p> <#> Your letter also refers to the allegations of structural damage during the site investigation. <#> Representatives of Geoconsult - Arup JV and Dublin Corporation met with local residents on 4th April 1996 and proposed, on the basis of an independent opinion from Forbairt, that the same drill rig be used to generate vibrations which could be then measured and assessed at the locations of the alleged cracks. <#> This proposal was rejected by the residents which is regrettable. <#> It is the considered opinion of the technical experts in Geoconsult - Arup JV that the vibrations from the drill rig could not cause structural damage and a number of tests were carried out in other areas subsequently which confirmed their views. <#> However they are more than willing to re-check the vibrations in the contentious areas if so allowed. </p>
 <p> <#> At all stages of the project due regard is given to the legislative and statutory provisions pertaining to the scheme. <#> In particular this applies to the E.I.S. which is being prepared in full accordance with the Roads Act 1993 and the Road Regulations 1994. <#> Wide scale consultation has been carried out during the preparation of the E.I.S. as recommended in the draft E.P.A. guidelines. </p>
 <p> <#> On the second page of the letter it is stated that <quote> ""very many people have little or no confidence in the project managers or any of the Authorities."" </quote> <#> It is not accepted that this is an accurate reflection of the views of the many people concerned, but instead is the reaction from a small number of people who are vehemently opposed to the tunnel. <#> It is in this context, that the statement regarding confidence should be viewed. <#> It is a matter of concern, of course, that there is a suggestion of lack of confidence. <#> The project team and all parties associated with the planning and design of the scheme will continue to provide comprehensive information to, and meet with, local people and their representatives. <#> The modes of consultation will be reassessed to see if they can be more direct and effective and also to build up greater rapport with local groups. </p>
 <p> <#> Your letter continues on to suggest that funding should be provided to local residents ' associations, to allow them to commission independent research and advice. <#> On the basis of a Dublin Corporation management decision, this suggestion was rejected earlier in the case of one particular group who had requested funding. <#> It is considered that this was the correct decision and should continue to apply. <#> The design work that has been done, has been executed in a professional, thorough and unbiased manner, and must be supported as such. <#> Funding of separate research by opposition groups is not necessary provided that the general and technical information in the E.I.S. be made available to the various interested groups, at least for inspection, and preferably for sale of copy. </p>
 <p> <#> It is noted that under Section 50 (2) (b) of the Roads Act 1993 that the E.I.S. must contain <quote> ""the data necessary to identify and assess the main effects which the proposed road development is likely to have on the environment"". <quote> <#> The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the public can examine information that the proposing Authority has collected on the environmental effects. <#> The critical issue is that the information is made readily available to the public and Dublin Corporation will be scrupulously careful in this regard. </p>
 <p> <#> In summary there is no basis to the allegations concerning the conduct and operations of the project team. <#> In all respects, and at all stages of the project to date, the scheme has been progressed in accordance with all legal requirements and obligations, and in a proper and professional manner at all times. <#> Finally all the main environmental data collected for the E.I.S. will be made available to the public as required under the Roads Act and in fulfillment of the democratic process. </p>

 <h> <ul> <#> THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN LEARNING </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> The term 'learning' is a scientific construction based on observations of behaviour in repeated situations. <#> The Oxford dictionary defines learning as <quote> ""getting knowledge of, or skill in, by study and/or experience"" </quote>, whilst the Encyclopedia <}> <-> Brittanica </-> <+> Britannica </+> </}> defines the term as <quote> ""the alteration of an individual 's behaviour as the result of experience"" </quote>. </p>
 <p> <#> Borger and Seaborne (1996) define learning as <quote> ""any more or less permanent change of behaviour which is the result of experience"" </quote>, as they contend that <quote> ""to consider learning is to consider how the interaction between an individual and his environment brings about changes in the way in which he tends to behave"" </quote>. <#> Piaget (1969) explains learning as <quote> ""involving adaptation to the environment and organisation of experience by means of action, memory, perceptions and other kinds of mental activities </quote>, whilst Gagn&/e (1967) defines learning as <quote> ""a change in human disposition of capability which can be retained and which is not simply ascribable to the process of growth"" </quote>. <#> He qualifies his definition by explaining that the kind of change called learning exhibits itself as a change in behaviour, and the inference of learning is made by comparing what behaviour was possible before the individual was placed in a <quote> ""learning situation"" </quote> and what behaviour can be exhibited after such treatment. <#> This change he contends, must have more than momentary permanence. <#> It must be capable of being retained over some period of time and it must be distinguishable from the kind of change that is attributable to growth, such as a change in height or the development of muscles through exercise. </p>
 <p> <#> Hilgard and Atkinson (1975) also contend that as not all behavioural changes are caused by learning, any definition of learning must exclude such changes. <#> Thus they define learning as <quote> ""a relatively permanent change in human behaviour that occurs as the result of prior experience"" </quote>. <#> They explain that the phrase <quote> ""relatively permanent"" </quote> excludes changes in behaviour that result from temporary or transient conditions such as fatigue or the influence of drugs. <#> Also, by specifying that learning is the result of ""experience"", they too are excluding behavioural changes that are due to maturation, disease, or physical damage. </p>
 <p> <#> Boyd, Apps et al (1980) in their deliberations about the concept of learning draw a definite distinction between education and learning. <#> They contend that the term ""education"" emphasises the educator, the agent of change who presents stimuli and reinforcement for learning and designs activities to induce change, whilst in contrast the term ""learning"" emphasises the person in whom the change occurs or is expected to occur. <#> They define learning as <quote> ""the act or process by which behavioural change, knowledge, skills, and attitudes are acquired"" </quote>. </p>
 <p> <#> On the other hand, Smith (1982) suggest that the term ""learning"" defies precise definition because it is put to multiple uses. <#> This is because, he argues, that the term ""learning"" is used to refer to (1) the acquisition and mastery of what is already known about something, (2) the extension and clarification of meaning of one 's experience, or (3) an organised, intentional process of testing ideas relevant to problems. <#> In other words, the concept of learning is as he states, <quote> ""used to describe a product, a process, or a function"" </quote>. </p>
 <p> <#> Thus although the problem of defining what the concept of learning is, has been the source of much discussion in the literature, it would appear that there exists agreement that the one basic requirement of learning is that some ""change"" must take place within the individual, with a learning skill being a way of organising and co-ordinating learning activity so that there is a retained change in the individual. </p>
 <p> <#> It would, however, be tempting to think that all one needed to do to turn people into skilled learners would be to identify the skills, ways, decisions and experiences needed and then tell the students about them. <#> But that is not the way one learns a skill, for, as Downs and Perry (1984) state <quote> ""being told about welding does not produce a skilled welder, as practice in welding with feedback is vital for the skill to develop."" </quote> <#> <}> <-> Similarily </-> <+> Similarly </+> </}>, if we want someone to improve their learning skills then they must practise and get feedback on their skills. <#> This can only take place through continual learning and feedback and reflection on both what is learned and how it is learned. <#> In addition, if as Borger and Seabourne (1966) state <quote> ""to consider learning is to consider how the interaction between an individual and his environment brings about changes in the way in which he tends to behave,"" </quote> then it would appear important for the teacher to be aware of the previously experienced learning strategies to which his or her students have been accustomed, as their expectation of the learning event will be influenced by the way in which experience has made him or her capable to respond to a learning stimulus. <#> Thus, later in this study, I would propose to examine if in relation to student nurses, an understanding of their expectations of the learning event by the nurse teacher, would enable him or her to shape the specific behaviour of such students, whose maturity, previously attained level of knowledge, and past experience of organising their interactions with the environment will influence their expectations of any learning situation. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> THE CONCEPT OF ADULT LEARNING </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> The concept of adult learning, which Elsdon (1975) describes as <quote> ""a movement from the familiar into the unfamiliar, a step in the dark which requires courage"" </quote> is not a new phenomenon, since man has had to learn to adapt continually to changing environments in order to survive. <#> However, as McCrea (1988) argues, the concept of the learning process which changes the adult 's way of responding as a result of environmental experience has changed over time as new learning needs emerged and studies of adult learning provided new knowledge of the processes of adult learning. </p>
 <p> <#> Piaget (1969) stated that <quote> ""the principal goal of education is to create men capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done"" </quote>. <#> Although, at the time Piaget was referring to the education of children, this quotation would be applicable to the adult learning situation, in so far as the object of adult education involves learning in the context of accumulated experience, skill, knowledge, opinions and prejudices, and building on these foundations, in addition to assisting mature people to change, accept new knowledge and learn to cope with a changing environment. <#> For, although the adult student 's learning experiences will be at least partly coloured by his or her school experience, there are differences between the adult student and the school pupil in relation to the learning situation. <#> For example, the former will no longer accept imposed discipline as a child will and is therefore more likely to become vocal if the depths of poor learning circumstances are analysed. </p>
 <p> <#> In addition, in contrast to the child who is bound by law to go to school, the adult 's motivation for learning will be varied. <#> Consequently, in the adult learning environment, a teacher faced with a class of mixed standards and interests may have little time for a depth analysis of motivation. <#> However, Jones (1969) contends that in the concept of adult learning, what is much more important than a depth-analysis of motivation is the student 's self concept in the class. <#> He, therefore, argues that the teacher should be aware of the picture that the student has in his own mind of what he is doing there, what he expects of the teacher, of the subject and of the other students, and how he relates his attendance at class with all his other concerns and responsibilities. </p>
 <p> <#> That students have the ability to learn has never been denied, although it has been said that learning is mainly undertaken in childhood and that the ability to learn, and therefore intelligence, decline as the adult ages. <#> But as research has shown in recent years the age limit on learning performance may not occur before 75 years (Cross 1979). <#> New concerns in the concept of lifelong learning have emerged as research on adult learning and development have become more well-known. <#> These findings have relevance for the learning potential of student nurses. <#> Research has shown, for example, Cross (1981), that adult learning and the methods by which adults learn are quite distinct from those that have been developed to date for the education of children but which have also been used in the education of adults. </p>
 <p> <#> Consequently, the art and science of helping adults to learn, termed Andragogy, and which Birchenhall (1985) informs one is defined by Meizrow (1983) as <quote> ""an organised and sustained effort to assist adults to learn in a way that enhances their capability to function as self directed learners"" </quote>, is a topic which has received in recent years considerable scientific investigation. <#> I would now like to comment upon this in relation to its relevance regarding the concept of adult learning. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> THE THEORY OF ANDRAGOGY </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> McCrea (1988) reminds one that the term andragogy first appeared in the literature in 1833 and was used to refer to the normal natural process of lifelong learning for adults. <#> Unfortunately, however, it was not until the late 1950's that writers on adult learning (Kidd 1959: Millar 1964: Knowles 1970) began to look critically at adult learning and to develop a theory of andragogy. </p>
 <p> <#> Knowles (1970), who defined andragogy as the art and science of helping adults to learn, cited four major characteristics relevant to andragogy, namely, self concept, experience, readiness to learn and orientation to learning. <#> Tibbles (1977) highlights how an examination of these four characteristics in adult learners would indicate that they are qualitatively different from those in child learners on which traditional pedagogy is based. </p>
 <p> <#> The first characteristic is the difference in self concept. <#> In contrast to children who tend to see themselves as dependent persons, adults perceive themselves as responsible self-directing individuals. <#> As Knowles (1970) states <quote> ""adulthood is the point at which an individual comes to see himself as being essentially self-directing"" </quote>. <#> Thus, an adult who views him or herself as being self-directing, and has, a need to be treated with respect, make his or her own decisions, and as Tibbles (1977) states, <quote> ""be seen as an important and unique individual"" </quote>. <#> Self-concept is therefore, concerned with the greater independence of adults. <#> This implies that learning situations should ideally allow for as much participation by learners as possible and suggests that if adults are placed in learning situations that do not incorporate their learning needs, they may resist learning. </p>
 <p> <#> The second characteristic is experience. <#> Knowles (1970) argues that as individuals mature they accumulate an expanding reservoir of experience that becomes an increasingly rich resource for learning and at the same time provides them with a broadening base to which to relate new learnings. <#> Experience is therefore, particularly significant with regard to adult learners because of the amount and variety of previous experience gained. <#> This implies, however, that transmission techniques of traditional teaching should be replaced by <}> <-> experiental </-> <+> experiential </+> </}> techniques which tap the experience of learners and involve them in analysing their experiences (McCrea 1988). <#> In addition, this experience can also contribute to the learning of others, a factor highlighted by Cooper (1972), who from her study of the adult nurse learners ascertained that <quote> ""nurses need to learn to respect each other 's knowledge and skills so that they can take advantage of this rich resource as they continue to learn"" </quote>. </p>
 <p> <#> The third characteristic is readiness. <#> Readiness is concerned with the timing of learning, that is, adults are ready to learn material relevant to their life situation. <#> In contrast to children whose readiness to learn is related to both biological development and social pressures, adults develop their readiness to learn as a result of the requirements of their various social roles. <#> Consequently, adult learners will display a variety of stages and demonstrate a diversity of readiness, depending on the relationship between their past experiences and new ideas, or what Cooper (1972) describes as their <quote> ""points of contact"" </quote>. <#> It is therefore crucial that a particular learning experience meets the adult learner 's needs if his or her readiness to learn is to be maximised. <#> To achieve this, the use of past experiences in relation to new ideas could be a useful technique, whilst grouping learners so that common requirements can be worked on together is another consideration. </p>
 <p> <#> The fourth characteristic is orientation to learning. <#> It is allied to two key factors, topic and time, by relating to a change in time perspective from one of postponed application of knowledge to immediacy of application, resulting in an orientation towards learning shifting from subject centred to problem centred. <#> In contrast to children, adults focus more on problems than on subject matter and desire immediacy of application rather than a reference to the future. <#> It is, however, necessary to point out that according to Tibbles (1977) there is now evidence that this is not invariably the case. <#> Nonetheless, it is still considered that this perspective of postponed application in children has created an orientation towards subject-centred learning, and in adults the time perspective of immediacy has produced a problem-centredness towards learning. </p>

 <h> <#> Part time work </h>
 <p> <#> From the point of view of unemployed men 's labour supply, 'flexibility' about moving off the unemployment register and into part time work cannot be separated from the question of pay flexibility or inflexibility. <#> At the time of study, family income supplement could only be claimed if the person was working more than 30 hours per week. <#> Since April 1988 family credit can be paid to those working more than 24 hours per week. <#> This means that a man (or woman) could now take a 'part time' job of 24-30 hours per week and claim family credit whereas he or she could not have claimed family income supplement. <#> However, this would entail a very heavy reliance on family credit: that is, it would make up a high proportion of total income (40-50 per cent, for example). <#> As the previous section showed, this is not a situation which is perceived positively by unemployed people. <#> Family credit as a 'top-up' of <*> pound sign </*> 10- <*> pound sign </*> 20 a week is an acceptable risk, but family credit as half of one 's income is perceived as a high risk strategy. </p>
 <p> <#> Men could, of course, take up part time work and remain on income support. <#> In doing so, their earnings are then considered as a top-up of benefit and come under the disregarded earnings provision of income support. <#> Nationally, and in this study, use of disregarded earnings provision is low (11 per cent in this study and about 5 per cent of unemployed people on income support nationally in 1989, (DSS, 1989). <#> The net effect of male unemployment in these couples was to discourage wives from taking up or keeping on part time work and to discourage men from taking up part time work (less than 24 hours a week) while unemployed. </p>
 <p> <#> At the time of this study, unemployed couples could each earn up to <*> pound sign </*> 4 per week net of work expenses before their supplementary benefit was affected, and thereafter deductions were pound for pound. <#> Under income support, this has since been raised to <*> pound sign </*> 5 a week each, inclusive of work expenses, for the first two years of unemployment, and a joint <*> pound sign </*> 15 a week thereafter. <#> Most couples had some basic knowledge of the arrangements for disregarded earnings, though they were much less likely to know that under supplementary benefit the figure was net of work expenses. <#> The reason why most did not exploit disregarded earnings was that the return was too small particularly when weighed against possible disruptions to benefit receipt. <#> Most people felt it was unlikely that they could find a job paying just the level of disregarded earnings and thus were aware that they would have to take a job paying more and have deductions from their benefit. <#> Some had done this in the past and they had experienced a considerable amount of 'hassle' from their local social security office as a consequence. <#> Benefit was totally stopped while proof of earnings were sought, deductions greater than earnings minus <*> pound sign </*> 4 (or more rarely <*> pound sign </*> 4 plus work expenses) were made, and so on. <#> Because of the low incomes claimants had and the fragility of managing on low incomes, such disruptions were serious matters indeed and experience of them prevented the take-up of subsequent part time work. <#> Even those without direct experience of such 'hassle' were aware that any change of circumstances carried a high risk of disruption in the receipt of benefits, and could readily imagine the 'hassle' that would ensue from earning more than the disregards limit. <#> The net gain from such 'hassle' was considered too low when weighed against the high risk of benefit disruption. </p>
 <p> <#> Not only did this result in very few families enhancing their living standards by combining some earnings with benefit receipt, but it also had an indirect effect on couples ' labour supply in relation to other forms of work. <#> As the previous section has shown, the strategy adopted was one of the 'family wage' earned by one partner, with possibly a relatively small top-up of in-work benefits. <#> Because wives were generally not employed when their husbands were unemployed, husbands were attempting to find full time jobs which would pay enough to keep the whole family rather than finding lower paid full time or part time jobs supplemented or complemented by wives ' earnings. <#> Such a strategy thus raised the wage (or income) sought by unemployed men. <#> It was difficult for the families to envisage adopting a strategy based on two low or part time wages because this would have required both partners to find jobs simultaneously. </p>
 <h> <#> Temporary, seasonal and casual work </h>
 <p> <#> Labour supply flexibility of unemployed men and women in respect of temporary, seasonal and casual work was also affected by the structure and administration of the social security system. <#> Skilled men and men in rural areas in particular were aware that there were opportunities for full time work of short duration, usually one to three weeks. <#> Women were aware that there were temporary, often seasonal (either Christmas or summer/holiday relief, typically 4-8 weeks), work opportunities, both full time and part time, which they were not seeking. <#> Why was this the case? </p>
 <p> <#> If such work was not to be treated as disregarded earnings (in the same way that regular small amounts of part time work are), then the only option was to sign off benefits completely, work for a short time, and then make a fresh claim. <#> There were a number of problems with such a strategy. <#> Firstly, because such work was of short durations (and often low paid), in-work benefits could play no role from a practical point of view. <#> Secondly, new claims for income support can and frequently do take several weeks to be processed (rarely, at least in the experience of these claimants, are claims processed and paid within one or two weeks). </p>
 <p> <#> As a result, signing-off and signing-on again carried a high risk of being followed by a period with no income. <#> The earnings offered by casual and temporary work were unlikely to be high enough to carry the family through an 'incomeless' period, and the net return from such an exercise was likely to be a loss, zero or very little gain indeed. </p>
 <p> <#> Two alternatives to this strategy were possible, the first of which was to remain nominally on income support and have one 's earnings disregarded. <#> As with part time work, this carried a high risk of loss of benefit and/or delay of benefit accompanied by only a small net return. <#> The second alternative was not to declare such work. <#> This alternative had been adopted by a small number of people in the study: 5 out of 110 had some undeclared earnings and 3 more had had undeclared earnings in the past. <#> Most undeclared earnings were either highly variable from week to week or took the form of occasional lump sums for specific jobs. <#> In contrast, the arrangements for disregarding earnings were very inflexible indeed, calculated as they are on the basis of regular weekly earnings, of the same amount each week. </p>
 <h> <#> Summary </h>
 <p> <#> The position as regards labour supply flexibility of unemployed men and the wives of unemployed men can be summarised as follows. <#> Men and women were flexible as regards the type of work they were prepared to do. <#> But men did not seek or apply for 'women 's jobs'. <#> The main reason they did not do so was the very low pay involved: 'women 's jobs' generally paid less than even unskilled 'men 's jobs' in the same economic sectors. <#> Men did apply for low paid jobs and they applied for jobs which paid less than their reservation wages and less than average earnings for the type of work concerned. <#> They did not, however, apply for very low paid full time jobs. <#> The men attempted to earn close to a family wage, with in-work benefits acting as a top-up or small supplement, not as a 'partner' to earnings, and women 's earnings did not enter the picture at all. <#> This was because women were not likely to work part time while their husbands were unemployed because of the low level of earnings rules and the risks of benefit disruption if more than the limit was earned, while women were unlikely to achieve anything near to a 'family wage' from full time work. <#> Flexibility in respect of full time, part time and short duration work was thus constrained by the structure of benefits. <#> The result was that, despite the fact that most men and women wanted to work and barely managed on their benefit incomes, the majority of families had no work or earnings whatsoever, were largely excluded from the 'flexible' work forms increasingly prevalent in their local labour markets, and were unable to respond positively to the higher level of demand for female than male labour. </p>
 <h> <#> THE ROLE OF SOCIAL SECURITY POLICY IN THE 1990's LABOUR MARKET </h>
 <p> <#> Major constraints on flexible participation in the labour market therefore arise not from the intransigence or inflexibility of claimants but from the reform, including the April 1988 social security reforms (which the relevant Green Paper hailed as the most fundamental review since Beveridge), has done virtually nothing to remove these inherent rigidities. <#> Policy for the foreseeable future appears to be based largely on what has gone before, pervaded by a distinction between full time and part time work which has become more and more artificial. </p>
 <h> <#> More of the same </h>
 <p> <#> In the last two reviews of supplementary benefit, the main constraint on encouraging part time work by extending provision for disregarded earnings has been expressed by government as the danger of undermining incentives for full time work. <#> The result has been that the concern not to undermine full time work incentives has in fact undermined part time work incentives - in some labour markets the only incentives that have any practical meaning - with the result that few unemployed families do any paid work. </p>
 <p> <#> The higher level of disregard of <*> pound sign </*> 15 per benefit unit after 2 years of unemployment introduced in 1988 is in nominal terms more generous than the previous disregard, although not in real terms (Bradshaw, 1985), and work-related expenses can no longer be discounted. <#> For those (mainly wives) doing regular part time work the higher disregard will mean that fewer hours need be spent working for nothing, although <*> pound sign </*> 15 represents no more than a day 's work and 2 years have to pass before even this much is retained. <#> For those, usually men, whose earnings take the form of episodic lump sums exceeding the value of the disregard in the week they are earned, the incentive not to declare them or not to participate in such work will hardly be any less. </p>
 <p> <#> In the context of increasing labour market flexibility and increases in long term unemployment, a more appropriate policy response would be to calculate disregarded earnings over much longer periods in recognition of the fact that it is not always possible to earn small amounts every week. <#> For those who are able to take up occasional work opportunities as they arise, such a system would allow them to support themselves from earnings when work is available without sacrificing the support of benefit when it is not. <#> If that were the case, some undeclared earnings might be regularised and brought into the open. </p>
 <p> <#> In addition to the marginal extension of disregards of part time work, a second theme in recent policy has been the promotion of in-work benefits. <#> This promotion of in-work benefits was foreshadowed in 1988 training White Paper (DE, 1988, p.31) which identified the greater use of these benefits as a source of public expenditure savings by encouraging more of the unemployed to consider low paid work with earnings supplemented by benefits. <#> The aim, then, is to reduce the level of wages sought by unemployed people with children by encouraging the view that wages are not the only component of in-work income. <#> Claimant advisers in the Employment Service have been given the task of promoting the consideration of in-work benefits by unemployed people and an extensive television and poster advertising campaign began in August 1988. </p>

 <p> <#> From the point of view of unemployed men 's labour supply, 'flexibility' about moving off the unemployment register and into part time work cannot be separated from the question of pay flexibility or inflexibility. <#> At the time of study, family income supplement could only be claimed if the person was working more than 30 hours per week. <#> Since April 1988 family credit can be paid to those working more than 24 hours per week. <#> This means that a man (or woman) could now take a 'part time' job of 24-30 hours per week and claim family credit whereas he or she could not have claimed family income supplement. <#> However, this would entail a very heavy reliance on family credit: that is, it would make up a high proportion of total income (40-50 per cent, for example). <#> As the previous section showed, this is not a situation which is perceived positively by unemployed people. <#> Family credit as a 'top-up' of <*> pound sign </*> 10- <*> pound sign </*> 20 a week is an acceptable risk, but family credit as half of one 's income is perceived as a high risk strategy. </p>
 <p> <#> Men could, of course, take up part time work and remain on income support. <#> In doing so, their earnings are then considered as a top-up of benefit and come under the disregarded earnings provision of income support. <#> Nationally, and in this study, use of disregarded earnings provision is low (11 per cent in this study and about 5 per cent of unemployed people on income support nationally in 1989, (DSS, 1989). <#> The net effect of male unemployment in these couples was to discourage wives from taking up or keeping on part time work and to discourage men from taking up part time work (less than 24 hours a week) while unemployed. </p>
 <p> <#> At the time of this study, unemployed couples could each earn up to <*> pound sign </*> 4 per week net of work expenses before their supplementary benefit was affected, and thereafter deductions were pound for pound. <#> Under income support, this has since been raised to <*> pound sign </*> 5 a week each, inclusive of work expenses, for the first two years of unemployment, and a joint <*> pound sign </*> 15 a week thereafter. <#> Most couples had some basic knowledge of the arrangements for disregarded earnings, though they were much less likely to know that under supplementary benefit the figure was net of work expenses. <#> The reason why most did not exploit disregarded earnings was that the return was too small particularly when weighed against possible disruptions to benefit receipt. <#> Most people felt it was unlikely that they could find a job paying just the level of disregarded earnings and thus were aware that they would have to take a job paying more and have deductions from their benefit. <#> Some had done this in the past and they had experienced a considerable amount of 'hassle' from their local social security office as a consequence. <#> Benefit was totally stopped while proof of earnings were sought, deductions greater than earnings minus <*> pound sign </*> 4 (or more rarely <*> pound sign </*> 4 plus work expenses) were made, and so on. <#> Because of the low incomes claimants had and the fragility of managing on low incomes, such disruptions were serious matters indeed and experience of them prevented the take-up of subsequent part time work. <#> Even those without direct experience of such 'hassle' were aware that any change of circumstances carried a high risk of disruption in the receipt of benefits, and could readily imagine the 'hassle' that would ensue from earning more than the disregards limit. <#> The net gain from such 'hassle' was considered too low when weighed against the high risk of benefit disruption. </p>
 <p> <#> Not only did this result in very few families enhancing their living standards by combining some earnings with benefit receipt, but it also had an indirect effect on couples ' labour supply in relation to other forms of work. <#> As the previous section has shown, the strategy adopted was one of the 'family wage' earned by one partner, with possibly a relatively small top-up of in-work benefits. <#> Because wives were generally not employed when their husbands were unemployed, husbands were attempting to find full time jobs which would pay enough to keep the whole family rather than finding lower paid full time or part time jobs supplemented or complemented by wives ' earnings. <#> Such a strategy thus raised the wage (or income) sought by unemployed men. <#> It was difficult for the families to envisage adopting a strategy based on two low or part time wages because this would have required both partners to find jobs simultaneously. </p>
 <h> <#> Temporary, seasonal and casual work </h>
 <p> <#> Labour supply flexibility of unemployed men and women in respect of temporary, seasonal and casual work was also affected by the structure and administration of the social security system. <#> Skilled men and men in rural areas in particular were aware that there were opportunities for full time work of short duration, usually one to three weeks. <#> Women were aware that there were temporary, often seasonal (either Christmas or summer/holiday relief, typically 4-8 weeks), work opportunities, both full time and part time, which they were not seeking. <#> Why was this the case? </p>
 <p> <#> If such work was not to be treated as disregarded earnings (in the same way that regular small amounts of part time work are), then the only option was to sign off benefits completely, work for a short time, and then make a fresh claim. <#> There were a number of problems with such a strategy. <#> Firstly, because such work was of short durations (and often low paid), in-work benefits could play no role from a practical point of view. <#> Secondly, new claims for income support can and frequently do take several weeks to be processed (rarely, at least in the experience of these claimants, are claims processed and paid within one or two weeks). </p>
 <p> <#> As a result, signing-off and signing-on again carried a high risk of being followed by a period with no income. <#> The earnings offered by casual and temporary work were unlikely to be high enough to carry the family through an 'incomeless' period, and the net return from such an exercise was likely to be a loss, zero or very little gain indeed. </p>
 <p> <#> Two alternatives to this strategy were possible, the first of which was to remain nominally on income support and have one 's earnings disregarded. <#> As with part time work, this carried a high risk of loss of benefit and/or delay of benefit accompanied by only a small net return. <#> The second alternative was not to declare such work. <#> This alternative had been adopted by a small number of people in the study: 5 out of 110 had some undeclared earnings and 3 more had had undeclared earnings in the past. <#> Most undeclared earnings were either highly variable from week to week or took the form of occasional lump sums for specific jobs. <#> In contrast, the arrangements for disregarding earnings were very inflexible indeed, calculated as they are on the basis of regular weekly earnings, of the same amount each week. </p>
 <h> <#> Summary </h>
 <p> <#> The position as regards labour supply flexibility of unemployed men and the wives of unemployed men can be summarised as follows. <#> Men and women were flexible as regards the type of work they were prepared to do. <#> But men did not seek or apply for 'women 's jobs'. <#> The main reason they did not do so was the very low pay involved: 'women 's jobs' generally paid less than even unskilled 'men 's jobs' in the same economic sectors. <#> Men did apply for low paid jobs and they applied for jobs which paid less than their reservation wages and less than average earnings for the type of work concerned. <#> They did not, however, apply for very low paid full time jobs. <#> The men attempted to earn close to a family wage, with in-work benefits acting as a top-up or small supplement, not as a 'partner' to earnings, and women 's earnings did not enter the picture at all. <#> This was because women were not likely to work part time while their husbands were unemployed because of the low level of earnings rules and the risks of benefit disruption if more than the limit was earned, while women were unlikely to achieve anything near to a 'family wage' from full time work. <#> Flexibility in respect of full time, part time and short duration work was thus constrained by the structure of benefits. <#> The result was that, despite the fact that most men and women wanted to work and barely managed on their benefit incomes, the majority of families had no work or earnings whatsoever, were largely excluded from the 'flexible' work forms increasingly prevalent in their local labour markets, and were unable to respond positively to the higher level of demand for female than male labour. </p>
 <h> <#> THE ROLE OF SOCIAL SECURITY POLICY IN THE 1990's LABOUR MARKET </h>
 <p> <#> Major constraints on flexible participation in the labour market therefore arise not from the intransigence or inflexibility of claimants but from the reform, including the April 1988 social security reforms (which the relevant Green Paper hailed as the most fundamental review since Beveridge), has done virtually nothing to remove these inherent rigidities. <#> Policy for the foreseeable future appears to be based largely on what has gone before, pervaded by a distinction between full time and part time work which has become more and more artificial. </p>
 <h> <#> More of the same </h>
 <p> <#> In the last two reviews of supplementary benefit, the main constraint on encouraging part time work by extending provision for disregarded earnings has been expressed by government as the danger of undermining incentives for full time work. <#> The result has been that the concern not to undermine full time work incentives has in fact undermined part time work incentives - in some labour markets the only incentives that have any practical meaning - with the result that few unemployed families do any paid work. </p>
 <p> <#> The higher level of disregard of <*> pound sign </*> 15 per benefit unit after 2 years of unemployment introduced in 1988 is in nominal terms more generous than the previous disregard, although not in real terms (Bradshaw, 1985), and work-related expenses can no longer be discounted. <#> For those (mainly wives) doing regular part time work the higher disregard will mean that fewer hours need be spent working for nothing, although <*> pound sign </*> 15 represents no more than a day 's work and 2 years have to pass before even this much is retained. <#> For those, usually men, whose earnings take the form of episodic lump sums exceeding the value of the disregard in the week they are earned, the incentive not to declare them or not to participate in such work will hardly be any less. </p>
 <p> <#> In the context of increasing labour market flexibility and increases in long term unemployment, a more appropriate policy response would be to calculate disregarded earnings over much longer periods in recognition of the fact that it is not always possible to earn small amounts every week. <#> For those who are able to take up occasional work opportunities as they arise, such a system would allow them to support themselves from earnings when work is available without sacrificing the support of benefit when it is not. <#> If that were the case, some undeclared earnings might be regularised and brought into the open. </p>
 <p> <#> In addition to the marginal extension of disregards of part time work, a second theme in recent policy has been the promotion of in-work benefits. <#> This promotion of in-work benefits was foreshadowed in 1988 training White Paper (DE, 1988, p.31) which identified the greater use of these benefits as a source of public expenditure savings by encouraging more of the unemployed to consider low paid work with earnings supplemented by benefits. <#> The aim, then, is to reduce the level of wages sought by unemployed people with children by encouraging the view that wages are not the only component of in-work income. <#> Claimant advisers in the Employment Service have been given the task of promoting the consideration of in-work benefits by unemployed people and an extensive television and poster advertising campaign began in August 1988. </p>

 <h> <bold> The Politics of Sensitive Research </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> <bold> SOCIOLOGISTS, </bold> when they carry out research, enter into personal and moral relationships with those they study, be they individuals, households, social groups or corporate entities (BSA Statement of Ethical Practice 1992). <#> These relationships become increasingly problematic where research involves studying topics that are sensitive. <#> According to Sieber and Stanley (1988), socially sensitive research refers to studies in which there are potential consequences or implications, either directly for the participants in the research or for the class of individuals represented by the research. <#> The overall research project to be discussed in this article was concerned with examining the extent and significance of informal economic activity in an estate characterised by high long-term unemployment located in West Belfast. <#> Part of the research involved assessing the extent of welfare benefit fraud within the chosen area. <#> Clearly this aspect of the research can be considered sensitive, as individual respondents or indeed the whole community may be harmed by the results and publication of research. <#> Sensitivity affects almost every stage of the research process from formulation through design to implementation and dissemination (Lee and Renzetti 1990). <#> According to Plummer (1983) sensitive research raises methodological, technical, ethical and political problems, as well as having potential effects on the researcher 's life. <#> This article is concerned with highlighting some of the main problems associated with studying a sensitive issue in a politically sensitive locality. <#> Rather than revealing conclusive answers to the methodological questions that sensitive topics pose to researchers, the article will attempt to add to the growing debate by discussing some of the difficulties faced, and how I addressed them. </p>
 <h> <bold> RESEARCH DESIGN </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Duelli Klein (1983) points out that <quote> 'the ""what"" to investigate must come prior to the decision of ""how"" to go about doing one 's research.' </quote> <#> Clearly, if the issue under investigation is a sensitive one, this restricts the range of methods that can be utilised to study the topic. <#> For example, in researching any group, the question arises immediately as to who or what to sample. <#> However, the more sensitive or threatening the topic, the more difficult sampling is likely to be, because potential participants have greater need to hide their involvement (Renzetti and Lee 1993). <#> Sensitivity renders random sampling impractical. <#> Two of the major strategies that can be used for sampling special populations that are deviant in some way are the location of locales within which sample members are likely to be found and the use of snowballing strategies to gain access to respondents. </p>
 <p> <#> In relation to my research, the estate I focused on was deliberately chosen, as it represented the peak unemployment area in Northern Ireland. <#> The high levels of unemployment which plagued the estate were documented in a number of reports and surveys (e.g. McAuley 1986). <#> Moreover, the estate was the focus for considerable negative media attention, being widely acknowledged as a dumping ground for 'problem' families. <#> This presented a number of moral and ethical problems. <#> While my overall intention was to look at the various forms of informal economic activity prevalent in the estate which fell outside conventional definitions of work as equal to formal employment, it was obvious that some of these activities would border on illegality. <#> This particularly applied to criminal activities and 'doing the double' which refers to working informally whilst simultaneously collecting welfare benefits. <#> Uncovering levels of social security abuse involves potential negative costs to those participating in the research. <#> I was aware from the outset that individuals and indeed the whole community may be harmed by the results of the research. <#> Moreover, perhaps I could be accused of holding preconceived prejudicial attitudes by initially deciding to focus on that area. <#> Negative images of 'scrounging Catholics ' abound in the media and the research could enhance the credibility to these biased viewpoints. <#> Finally, from an ethical viewpoint, have I the right to expose the 'wrongdoings ' of others for the sake of demonstrating the fallacy of equating work with formal employment? <#> There are no easy answers to any of these issues. <#> I could justify my decision to locate the research in the estate by stressing that my choice was mainly motivated by my part-time employment in a community school in the area. <#> Hence I felt that this avenue would enhance my access to the wider community. <#> Whether this justification removes the moral and ethical dilemmas posed by the research is debatable. <#> All the researcher can do is constantly reflect on the heightened responsibilities to respondents in terms of privacy, confidentiality and anonymity where respondents are being asked to reveal incriminating information about themselves. <#> The fact that sensitive topics pose complex issues and dilemmas for researchers does not imply that such topics should not be studied (Lee and Renzetti 1990). <#> As Sieber and Stanley (1988) point out: <quote> <#> ...sensitive research addresses some of society 's most pressing social issues and policy questions. <#> Although ignoring the ethical issues in sensitive research is not a responsible approach to science, shying away from controversial topics simply because they are controversial, is also an avoidance of responsibility. </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> The remainder of this article will deal with the methodological, technical and ethical issues inherent in studying sensitive issues. </p>
 <h> <bold> METHODOLOGICAL AND TECHNICAL ISSUES </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> When dealing with sensitive topics, the researcher has to primarily decide which style of research is best-equipped to overcome respondents ' resistance (Brewer 1993). <#> Bearing in mind the sensitive nature of the topic and the sensitive natures of the estate itself, I felt that a questionnaire which asked about controversial issues such as 'doing the double', especially when put by a stranger, would not only be unreliable because of the reluctance of respondents to give truthful answers, but also could be a potentially dangerous activity. <#> Rather, I felt that qualitative research based on participant observation and extensive unstructured and semi-structured interviews were best suited to my purposes. <#> Brewer (1993) suggests that qualitative methods have special qualities for dealing with controversial topics in sensitive locations, as they entail a gradual and progressive contact with respondents which is sustained over a long period, allowing a rapport to be slowly established. </p>
 <p> <#> My initial and preferred research method was to utilise the snowball sampling technique. <#> Snowball sampling has particular qualities for dealing with deviant populations. <#> Contacts with one or two well-known and trusted people in the area can be utilised to gain access to a wider sample of respondents. <#> Moreover, initial contacts can be actuated to vouch for the researcher. <#> Morrissey <it> et al. </it> (1984) suggest that this is the only feasible way of researching social security abuse. <#> Working in the community school within the estate provided me with a number of key informants and I intended to gain access to the wider community by interviewing my informants ' social networks and associates in a snowball pattern. <#> While snowball sampling throws up problems of representativeness, nonetheless I felt that this was the only way I would be able to gain meaningful data on informal economic activity. <#> Throughout my period of working in the community school, I heard countless 'stories' of how various bureaucrats, particularly 'dolebusters', had gained information on the work patterns of the unemployed in the area by pretending to be researchers carrying out door-to-door interviews. <#> These 'stories' were related to me with such frequency that they further increased <}> <-> by </-> <+> my </+> </}> misgivings about the survey method. </p>
 <p> <#> However, after adopting the approach for one year, I decided to supplement the methodology by carrying out a survey of the area. <#> I became unhappy with the snowball technique for several reasons. <#> Firstly, the method proved very time-consuming. <#> Long periods lapsed between respondents expressing their willingness to pass me through their social networks and these contacts materialising. <#> Even when interviews were arranged, often the setting was the community school rather than the respondents ' households. <#> It seemed logical to my contacts that the community school should serve as an interview base and they stated that this would enhance the willingness of their associates to talk to me as anonymity would be assured. <#> However, I felt that often these interviews took place in an artificial setting and valuable data was lost by separating respondents from their household environment. <#> As time progressed, I became increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of the data I was collecting. <#> Sample sizes were small. <#> Respondents were interviewed mainly in isolation from their households and the wider community. <#> Hence, after one year in the field, I decided to supplement the data I had already collected by carrying out a survey of one in four households in the estate, generating a sample size of 150 households. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> THE SURVEY </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> One of the most difficult aspects of the survey was walking up the garden paths to the individual houses and convincing the occupants to allow me to come in and interview them. <#> As Homan (1991) points out, the interviewer on the doorstep stands at the frontier of private space. <#> I often felt like a salesperson trying to sell some unwanted and unnecessary item. <#> In gaining access to households and obtaining information, I was greatly assisted by the fact that I originally came from a Catholic working-class area in West Belfast, situated about two miles from the area studied (although I might add that until my employment in the community school, I had never been inside the estate where the research took place). <#> Burton (1978) illustrates how the process of 'telling' permeates social relationships among Catholics and Protestants in Belfast. <#> 'Telling' is the patterns of signs and cues by which religious ascription is arrived at in everyday interactions of Protestants and Catholics. <#> It is based on the social significance attached to, among other things, name, face, dress, area of residence and school attended. <#> Burton (1978) argues that, in particular, the area one lives in, is of paramount importance for the Belfast working class. <#> Hence interviews were often preceded by attempts by respondents to pry into my background. <#> I must admit that I welcomed these intrusions into my personal life and indeed often initiated conversations around issues which enabled me to establish some sort of co-membership with individual respondents. </p>
 <p> <#> Feminist researchers (Oakley 1981, Kennedy Bergen 1993) advocate the use of self-disclosure or reciprocity on the part of the researcher as a means of overcoming participants ' inhibitions. <#> Once it was established that I was one of them, trust and confidence were often secured. <#> On the other hand, this relationship places greater responsibility on the researcher and intensifies the ethical issues concerned with studying both a sensitive topic in a politically sensitive area. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> PRAGMATIC COMPROMISES </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> I told all respondents that I was using a pseudonym for the estate and that while this would enhance anonymity, I could give no guarantees that the location would remain secret. <#> Barnes (1979) argues that a pseudonym only offers a partial disguise. <#> Most individuals are able to recognise themselves and through time one 's colleagues come to share the secret of where the research was based. <#> However, Barnes argues that even if a disguise is transparent, it may still serve a useful purpose in that it may shield the area from casual approach. <#> Identities remain uncertain and ambiguous and this may provide some useful protection if a powerful outsider tries to use the research as evidence against the respondents. <#> I also gave assurances that pseudonyms would be used to describe all persons mentioned in the data. <#> Hence individual identities would remain anonymous, except perhaps to co-residents in the estate, who may recognise individual identities in the final report. <#> Thus no space existed on the questionnaires for the names and addresses of respondents and this was illustrated to each household. <#> This proved important, as on several occasions I was stopped and searched by army patrols in the area, in full view of the residents of the estate. <#> Taylor (1988) argues that, at various times, researchers have been forced into hiding or have had to leave Northern Ireland, due to unfounded fears that research materials were finding their way to the security forces. <#> The above incident served as a timely, though unnecessary reminder, of the highly-politicised natures of the social field within which the research was located. <#> Throughout the survey, I had to make a number of pragmatic compromises which departed from the textbook portrayal of ideal research practice. <#> Brewer (1993) suggests that when research involves sensitive locations and/or topics, the pragmatic compromises multiply in number and in the degree of departures from ideal practice. <#> Given these considerations, the main method utilised was the loosely structured interview, using an interview schedule containing mainly open-ended questions. <#> I decided to omit direct questions on the illegal aspects of informal economic activity from the interview schedule. <#> Rather I hoped to introduce this aspect casually during my interaction with the respondents. <#> Brannen (1988) suggests that researchers into sensitive topics need to tread warily, particularly at the beginning of interviews, and not reveal all their hand at the outset. <#> She further states that it is important not to prejudge the research problem by labelling it or defining its boundaries too closely; respondents may thereby define the problem in their own terms. <#> Hence, in relation to this study, while all the interviews were structured by an interview schedule, the natural progression of the conversation dictated the final nature of the interviews. <#> The interviewing proved to be a very time-consuming process. <#> When interviewing, my intention was to allow the research topic to emerge gradually in its own terms. <#> This often meant that respondents would become totally absorbed in talking about their own lives. <#> Often the issues covered were not directly related to my research interests. <#> In these <}> <-> circumstance </-> <+> circumstances </+> </}> , my inclination was not to interrupt. <#> As a result, often respondents would give away telling information about themselves which sometimes was at odds with earlier responses, especially those given in answer to direct questions. <#> Moreover, during the conversations, I wanted to adopt as unobtrusive a role as possible. <#> Therefore I felt that writing down everything that was said would interrupt the natural flow of the conversations. <#> Hence while responses to direct questions were noted, conversations were generally trusted to memory. <#> Rather only key words and phrases were jotted down. <#> Usually interviews were only carried out one at a time. <#> Once the interview ended, I left the estate immediately to write down the informal conversation. <#> This was due to distortion in memory recollections. <#> Again this meant that the process was very time consuming. <#> Interviews lasting three or four hours were not uncommon and this was generally followed by a number of hours spent recalling conversations. </p>
 <h> <bold> COMMON PROBLEMS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The approach outlined above throws up other problems. <#> The flexible manner in which the interviews were carried out may have implications for the reliability of the material gathered. <#> In some households I sensed an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility and felt it unwise to motivate discussions on the illegal aspects of informal economic activity. <#> In this respect, the interviews were not consistent and valuable data may have been lost due to my personal interpretation of the situation. <#> The final account of the research makes much of the informal conversations I had with the respondents. <#> The problem remains, to what extent can I utilise these informal conversations as trustworthy data? <#> There is no easy solution to this problem. <#> While there was a high level of internal consistency within the data encouraging me to treat the data as provisionally reliable, nonetheless I do not want to reduce the issue here to a simple claim of truth in repetition. <#> At the end of the day, whether or not the approach was successful or not is best left to the judgment of the reader of the overall account. <p>

 <p> <#> Among places of enchantment were the woods, with their laurel, chestnut and hazelnut groves. <#> Each season brought its own magic to the woods. <#> Building tree houses in the lushness of summer, gathering conkers in the multicoloured autumn, wandering through the scented bluebells and wild garlic in May and collecting holly and ivy in the cold, bare woods at Christmas time, were some of the seasonal variations of activity. <#> Born by the sea, one never loses the sound of the sea and the majestic Shannon estuary at Tarbert was a continual fascination in a whole variety of ways. <#> There was swimming in the favoured spots such as Rusheen, Wall 's Bay, the Slatey Pier, the Island and the Back-o-the-hill. <#> There was fishing from the pier and on ""The Bank"". <#> Periwinkles, bornachs and mussels were in profusion and unpolluted along the shores. <#> The tides came and went in ceaseless motion, ships plied up and down the river, and the curlews, seagulls, swans and widgeon brought the reed-fringed mudflats and creeks to life. <#> Tarbert Island with its lighthouse, battery coastguard station and gantry brought <it> Treasure Island </it> and <it> Coral Island </it> close to home, and bands of cowboys and Indians, or hordes of cops and robbers worked out their fantastical games in-and-out through the ruins. </p>
 <p> <#> In April and May the boglands called for the turf-cutting, and through the summer they spread their splendour of bog-cotton, heathers, furze and many-coloured mosses to enchant the eye. <#> The cutting and saving of hay, with a heavy reliance on manual skill and horse power, had fun as well as work attached to it. <#> The satisfaction of leaving a wyned meadow in the evening sun, with the aroma of freshly saved hay in the nostrils, stays as a haunting memory. </p>
 <p> <#> There was no time for boredom, the word was never used. <#> There were many hunts - rabbits, hares, foxes and the occasional badger hunt. <#> The ""horse-park"" was the mecca for groups of young and established football players in the evenings as aspiring youngsters tried to imitate their heroes. <#> The year was <}> <-> pun- ctuated </-> <+> punctuated </+> </}> with a variety of activities and events which were very congenial to youngsters. <#> The great carnivals, which drew huge crowds of all ages to the village, were held in August. <#> The fancy dress parades were highly elaborate and imaginative. <#> It took a couple of hours for all the sections of the parade, from individuals to large groups, to pass through the crowds lining the streets. <#> Horses, tractors and lorries were used by the larger groups for their colourful presentations. <#> Regattas with their boat races, swimming races, greasy poles and pillow fights, brought great excitement to the island. <#> Matches in football tournaments drew large partisan audiences. <#> At night the pubs resounded to laughter, songs, music and arguments. <#> There was no consciousness of a generation gap in the dancers who thronged the marquee. <#> The carnivals may not have had the flamboyance and exhilaration of a mardi gras, but they had as much vitality as an Irish community could give them. <#> Other summer occasions were marked in different ways, for instance, May Eve was treated with a sense of unease and respect. <#> The summer tree (sycamore) was brought into the houses, and whispers were made of the ""piseogs"" which could be perpetrated on that evening, which retained vestiges of old pagan folk memory. <#> The old festival of mid-summer was also marked by the mighty bonfires on the Market Road on St. John 's night, for which materials were gathered evenings in advance. <#> We danced and played as the flames and sparks went higher in the night sky, giving us feelings, at once, of both fascination and dread. </p>
 <p> <#> The autumn evenings were marked by the Listowel races, the All-Ireland final and the Glin Coursing. <#> As altar boys we visited the houses throughout the parish for the stations in the mornings, and attended at the October rosary and benedictions in the evenings. <#> These led on to Halloween, with the excitement of ""high-fiddles"", snap apple, Halloween games and blind-man 's-buff. <#> The abundance of apples, nuts and barmbracks were consumed with relish. </p>
 <p> <#> Christmas, of course, was special in the village, as everywhere else. <#> Many of us, however, preferred the activity of Stephen 's Day to the quiet atmosphere of Christmas Day. <#> Groups of us gathered and tramped the countryside with the Wren-boys, generally being warmly welcomed and well-treated in the houses which dotted the landscape. <#> Trudging home from the hills of Ballygaughlin, with lights and Christmas candles lighting the dark, and with many days of Christmas holidays stretching ahead, was a good feeling. <#> New Year 's Eve was a special night in the village when crowds gathered in torchlight procession, with accordions and bodhr&/ans bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the new. <#> The music, dancing and songs carried on in the village square into the early hours. </p>
 <p> <#> At other times, the village was entertained by the sounds and smells of the animals, which were part of the agricultural economy of the region. <#> The cattle fairs, bull-tests and pig sales brought varied activity to delight youngsters. <#> The great social occasion of the creamery, particularly on summer mornings, created a buzz of activity and conversation in the village, and also brought town and country close together. <#> The forge with its sizzling fire and sound of the anvil also brought town and country and hedgehogs together, as youngsters vied to blow the large bellows to redden the blacksmith 's horseshoes. </p>
 <p> <#> The carpenter 's shop with its resin-smelling ringlets of shavings was also a place of delights. <#> The whine of the great saws mingled with the carpenter 's hammer blows, as cradles, coffins, carts and crates were fashioned. <#> Nearby was the parish hall which housed the billiards club, the hops and the whist drives for the older groups. </p>
 <p> <#> The school, for good or ill, is the institution which has a vast range of influences upon us when we are young. <#> Many experiences <}> <-> occured </-> <+> occurred </+> </}> there with life enhancing as well as debilitating effects, but which stay with us to the grave. <#> In our time the tolling of the church bell for mass, angelus, or funeral was close to us in the school. <#> In the church the great events of Catholic life - baptism, confirmation, marriage and funeral - were conducted and, to the eyes of us altar boys, had an interesting ritual about them, if also tinged with trepidation at times. <#> The primary school had been built in 1869 and was strictly segregated between boys and girls. <#> Facilities were rather spartan, and the large rooms depended on the quality of the turf, brought by children 's parents, for the open fires. <#> Discipline tended to be on the <quote> ""spare the rod, spoil the child"" </quote> principle, with catechism class particularly fraught with anxiety. <#> For some of us, practice with the mouthorgan band brightened the rather narrow curricular range, which was based primarily on English, Irish and Arithmetic, with a welcome dimension of History and Geography added. </p>
 <p> <#> A minority of pupils went on to secondary school in the nearby St. Ita 's. <#> This was one of the small lay, co-educational secondary schools to be found, fairly regularly, in Kerry and Limerick at the time. <#> The founder of the school, Miss McKenna, was a noted educationalist who set high standards as the norm, particularly in her specialist subjects, English and French. <#> She and her team opened up for us teenagers the richness of new languages, great literatures, mathematics and so on. <#> It was also an era in which the competition for the public examinations was much less intense than to-day. <#> Pupils cycled and bussed from nearby townlands and villages to the school. </p>
 <p> <#> We were always conscious that most parents took schooling seriously, and one took for granted a regard for learning, which was part of the tradition of the region. <#> Both the national and secondary schools bore witness to the long-term impact, which gifted teachers can have, on the attitudes and outlook of youngsters in their formative years. <#> Since that time the ""school on the hill"" has been replaced by a splendid comprehensive school, and it is gratifying to know that the traditions of good schooling and scholarship are alive and well in that corner of north Kerry. </p>
 <p> <#> The forties and fifties were decades of economic depression, and many families suffered from the deprivations of real poverty. <#> Employment, other than in agriculture, was very rare and emigration was the lot of many. <#> It was sad to see so many of one 's school pals gathering at the corner to catch the bus to Limerick and be on their way to England. <#> To get there, they were often aided by the allowances gained on F.C.A. training camps. <#> It was the scarcity of money which acted as a constraining and blighting force on many people. <#> The fabric of community life was maintained and, often, the very poor did not allow their material impoverishment to quench the spirit of their personalities. <#> To a degree the old proverb <&Irish> ""Ar sc&/ath a ch&/eile a mhaireann na daoine"" </&Irish> was borne out, and various quiet forms of assistance were available. <#> Nevertheless, life, in general, was affected by the lack of a employment for the people of the area. <#> Even as a youngster, one was conscious of this overlay of economic hard-times, and despite the richness of aspects of community life, the potential of many individuals was not realised. </p>
 <p> <#> A striking feature of this community life was the respect for individuals, the tolerance for eccentricities and a regard for the ""characters"". <#> People were known for particular songs, or yarns, experiences or skills. <#> This I have found to be a strong feature of life in Kerry, but, no doubt, is not <}> <-> inique </-> <+> unique </+> </}> to it. <#> There is, however, a delight in difference, a pleasure in language usage and a regard for the individual experience, which <}> <-> ia </-> <+> is </+> </}> a valuable feature of life there. </p>
 <h> <it> <#> Old Glories Reflected in Stone </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Among many features one would like to dwell on, I will touch on one which struck me very forcibly, as a young person, but which was not much mentioned - Tarbert 's walls. <#> To a youngster 's eye in the forties and fifties there was very little industrial or commercial employment in the village, but all around one were mighty walls and large buildings which spoke to one of a different era, a bygone era in a Tarbert which must have been very different. <#> They stood silent as sentinels and witnesses of a Tarbert which must have been more vibrant. <#> They symbolised an era when there must have been great collective endeavour. <#> The question arose as to what had happened in old <}> <-> Tabert </-> <+> Tarbert </+> </}> that left us so many monuments in stone, which seemed out of keeping with the community 's character at the time one was growing up. <#> Only communities with a sense of confidence, of collective purpose and of optimism built on a grand scale, and such optimism was foreign to the decades of the forties and fifties. <#> Another question which arises in one 's mind was the number of skilled craftsmen who must have been there to build such splendid edifices. <#> The scale of the building projects would have required a whole sophisticated culture in crafts, but particularly in stone masonry. <#> When I looked at skilled masons in our time, they seemed to be the inheritors of this older tradition. <#> As well as the scale of the buildings and the remaining walls of greater edifices, one was also struck by the beauty of the stone itself and by the skill and sense of pride which exuded from the workmanship. </p>
 <p> <#> The surviving evidence went back to the medieval times as evidenced in Kilnaughtin Church and Lislaughtin Abbey. <#> In the latter, the beauty of the dovetailing of the flat river stones with the shaped limestone of sedilia and lintel windows has been beautifully caught by the Polish artist Ursula Ratzlaff O'Carroll. </p>

 <p> <#> THE FORMATION of a quality food chain...detailed knowledge of physical and financial performance on-farm...attention to animal welfare and environmental issues... protection of our high animal health status...feed formulation to reach the genetic potential at each growth stage and very close attention to management detail were all outlined as means to ensure the survival of the pig industry in Province, by speakers at the NI Pig Conference, held at Cookstown this week. </p>
 <p> <#> The conference, which was organised and sponsored by John Thompson <*> ampersand </*> Sons, Elanco Animal Health and NuTec Holdings (Irl) Ltd, attracted a wide audience with all aspects of the industry, from production to processing being represented. </p>
 <p> <bold> <#> Victor Truesdale, </bold> sales director with John Thompson <*> ampersand </*> Sons, summing up the wealth of information, said: <quote> ""Some of the measures outlined are in the control of the individual farmer but others will require industry wide co-operation if they are to be achieved. </p>
 <p> <#> ""However if we are serious about our industry we have to tackle these issues in a meaningful way."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Industry measures outlined at the conference included the possibility of a quality food chain where all sectors get together to produce a quality product that has consumer confidence, and will attract premium markets. <#> Strict quality control and meaningful financial incentives should be used to maintain such a structure. </p>
 <p> <#> A total industry effort will be required to maintain our high animal health status and to find systems that will meet all EU requirements for animal welfare and environmental pollution. </p>
 <p> <#> The opportunities for the feed industry and producers to work together to target specific growth stages of the pig were also highlighted. </p>
 <p> <#> <bold> FINANCING THE ENTERPRISE: </bold> Discussing how his bank might react to a request for a substantial loan for a new pig unit on a green field site, <bold> Stephen Smith, </bold> Agricultural Adviser to the Ulster Bank, pointed out that the pig industry was characterised by fluctuations in profitability, a decline in pig prices in real terms and difficulties in the processing sector. </p>
 <p> <#> With this industry image the bank will insist on detailed financial information on the farm to highlight past performance and to draw up a realistic and flexible business plan for the future. </p>
 <p> <#> A new unit would have to conform to welfare and environmental disease unit. <#> The extra costs which such measures would entail must all be built into the business plan, plus working capital for the purchase and maintenance of stock until the first animals are sold. </p>
 <p> <#> Stephen Smith produced figures to show that the annual cost of repaying the loan plus interest over a 10-year period could vary from <*> pound sign </*> 22.60 per pig where 17 pigs are sold per sow per year, to <*> pound sign </*> 16.70 where 23 pigs are sold per sow. </p>
 <p> <#> He pointed out that such expenditure is very difficult to justify when it is compared with an average margin over feed for the past five years of <*> pound sign </*> 15.35, as recorded in John Thompson <*> ampersand </*> Sons 'management plan. </p>
 <p> <#> He said: <quote> ""Some other source of capital and/or source of repayment is therefore desirable."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Income from other enterprises can over disruption to cash flow in the early stages, but a high standard of management and a business-like approach are essential in the long term to minimise the effect of repayments. </p>
 <p> <#> Farmers could also consider returns from other sources such as sale of breeding stock and selling to specialised outlets. </p>
 <p> <#> However, Stephen Smith 's viewpoint is that the real hope for the future of the industry is the establishment of a quality food chain where there is feedback of information from the consumer and where the achievement of the standards required command a meaningful premium to ensure loyalty to the chain. </p>
 <p> <#> Stephen pointed out that 100 per cent finance is not usually attractive to the banks and farmers could reduce the initial debt by joint ventures. <#> A joint venture with a feed compounder or pig processor could provide some stability in profitability and could also form part of the quality food chain which seems the most likely survival route for the industry. </p>

 <p> <#> The harbour-front also saw development with the opening of the two restaurants, ""Russells"" and ""Dragon Boat"". <#> A hairdresser, cafe and art shop followed mainly situated on the station end of Harbour Road. </p>

 <h> <quote> <ul> <#> ""Controversy, Uproar, Apprehension"". </ul> </quote> </h>
 <p> <#> When one considers recent development in Howth, what comes to mind first is the degree of controversy attached to its recent planning history. <#> The three most notable cases are those involving ""Red Rock"", ""East Mountain"", and ""Howth House"". <#> Before discussing these in detail, we should look at the factors leading to the atmosphere existing in Howth in the late 1980's and early 1990's as regards development. </p>
 <p> <#> Howth is a public area. <#> For thousands of Dublin residents as well as those from further afield, Howth represents an area of recreation. <#> It has a long association with recreation and bathing, going back to the 18th Century. <#> Any development which would effect the recreational value of Howth, is not only resisted by Howth 's residents, but by its thousands of visitors. </p>
 <p> <#> Howth is an affluent area. <#> It has, as residents, a large number of well educated middle and upper middle-class residents. <#> This social group tends to have more time available to it for taking an active interest in planning conflicts and environmental issues. <#> They also tend to be more aware of their rights regarding development in their area and have the resources to pursue such rights. </p>
 <p> <#> After what had happened in Sutton in the 1960's with most of its open spaces being developed for residential use, a certain air of apprehension was present in Howth. <#> Howth represented the last bastion of large open spaces available for recreation in North East Dublin. </p>
 <p> <#> The ""1980 Dublin City Development Plan"" had given Howth a special mention highlighting its recreational importance in the eyes of the Corporation. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Generally the policy relating to Howth is to maintain the character of the village, the outstanding natural amenity areas and attractive features of the peninsula. <#> Future development shall be strictly related to the indicated use zones including the infilling of existing developed areas rather than further extension of these areas. <#> Tracts of open land, including Ireland 's Eye, will be preserved so as to maintain the natural scenic character of the area. <#> Development will be strictly controlled in visually prominent areas and in existing undeveloped areas"". </quote> </p>
 <#> (1980 Dublin City Development Plan; 2.10.6.)
 <p> <#> Pat McCarton cited Bull Island as a <quote> ""good example of Dublin Corporations capacity to appreciate and to protect scenic areas."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Howth was given to the Co. Council Planning Department in 1986, through political <}> <-> manoeuvering </-> <+> manoeuvring </+> </}> at Department of Environment level. <#> The Howth residents did not have any say in the matter. <#> <quote> ""Even the Corporation"" </quote> emphasises Eric Allen, <quote> ""were opposed to giving up Howth because they had long term plans for the area and they understood Howth and had a working relationship with Howth"". </quote> <#> The Local Authority Act in 1985, resulted in Howth becoming part of the large county area, Dublin - Fingal. <#> Michael O'Neill stated that he felt that the importance of Howth was considered minor in the context of the county as a whole, by the Co. Council and that they did not <quote> ""attach the same importance to its value as an amenity space for Dubliners"". </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Thus, a resentment of the Co. Council was evident amongst Howth conservationists from the very beginning. </p>
 <p> <#> This resentment was to be deepened in the years to follow owing to three highly publicised planning conflicts which shook the Howth peninsula. </p>
 <h> <quote> <ul> <#> ""The Red Rock Affair"". </ul> </quote> <#> (See Map 3 in Appendix for location.) </h>
 <p> <#> The first and probably the most infamous of development proposals in Howth, was the proposed developments on Red Rock. <#> Two separate applications, on adjoining plots in the Red Rock area, were made in the recent history of Howth. </p>
 <p> <#> The first ""battle"" goes back to 1953, when the then Minister for Local Government, Paddy Smith, decided to grant permission over the head of the Dublin Corporation, for a housing development on the 16 acre site. <#> The scheme for up to 29 houses was never implemented and the site was sold 10 years later to Mr. <#> Thomas O'Reilly, a Rathgar builder. </p>
 <p> <#> Under the 1976 Local Authority (Planning and Development) Act, all planning permission which had not previously been implemented, were invalid by November 1st, 1981. <#> But this was extended by 12 months by the Minister for the Environment leading to a rush to develop sites whose planning permission would be revoked in 1982. </p>
 <p> <#> Mr. O'Reilly, through his company, Family Properties Ltd., applied for planning permission for a residential development of the 16 acre site. <#> But so determined was Dublin City Council to prevent development in this scenic area, that it decided to revoke the 1953 ministerial permission. </p>
 <p> <#> Mr. O'Reilly appealed to Bord Pleanala in June 1982, but the board confirmed the <}> <-> Corporations's </-> <+> Corporation 's </+> </}> decision. <#>
 <p> <#> Family Properties Ltd. then exercised its right to serve a ""Purchase Notice"" on the Corporation, requiring it to purchase its 16 acre site, the price being decided by an arbitrator. <#> It also claimed over two million pounds in compensation for loss of development rights. </p>
 <p> <#> In 1986, amidst the conflict, the site fell under the jurisdiction of the Co. Council, which had adopted the role of Howth 's planning authority. <#> The Council found itself facing a huge compensation claim from Family Properties Ltd. </p>
 <p> <#> The council decided to conduct discussions with the company involved to reach a suitable solution. <#> <}> <-> the </-> <+> The </+> </}> agreement, put forward to the elected member of Dublin County Council was compromising, to say the least. </p>
 <p> <#> Under the agreement, the 16 acre site was valued at a lower figure of <*> pound sign </*> 809,000. <#> The Council agreed to purchase eight acres of the land for <*> pound sign </*> 250,000. <#> In the 1980 Dublin City Development Plan, 8 acres of the site was zoned for residential development and 8 acres for high amenity. <#> The County agreed to purchase the amenity-zoned land. <#> For the other 8 acres, it agreed to grant planning permission for a residential development scheme by Mr. O'Reilly. <#> If the board overturned the Council 's decision to grant permission, the agreement stipulated that Family Properties Ltd. would receive in exchange for its 8 acre site, a Council site of equal value (<*> pound sign </*> 550,000). <#> This marked the beginning of the compensation-avoiding compromises which would be made time and time again. <#> An Bord Pleanala overturned the Council 's decision, once again saving the scenic area from development. </p>
 <p> <#> In March 1989, Mr. O'Reilly agreed to hand over his 16 acres of land to the County Council in return for the <*> pound sign </*> 250,000 and an additional <*> pound sign </*> 550,000 if they failed to provide him with an alternative 8 acres. </p>
 <p> <#> In November 1988, a new threat to the Red Rock site manifested itself in the form of Flambeau Ltd. <#> Two local residents, Paul Power and Aidean Crowe, purchased a 46 acre site, adjoining the O'Reilly site. <#> Their company Flambeau, aimed to develop a residential area on the site and applied for full planning permission. <#> The Flambeau site was zoned for amenity use in the 1980 Dublin City Development Plan. <#> In March 1989, the Council refused planning permission for the proposed development, saying that it would be <quote> ""seriously injurious to the preservation of views and prospects across the site to Baldoyle and Portmarnock"". </quote> </p>
 <#> (Irish Times 5/3/89). 
 <p> <#> The Council also saw a danger to public safety arising from the development by: <quote> ""creating a traffic hazard through the opening up of shared access to the six houses on St. Fintan 's Road which is currently defined as sub-standard"". </quote> </p>
 <#> (Irish Times 5/3/89). 
 <p> <#> By taking care to cite several particular reasons why development could not be permitted such as the risk to public safety, the Council removed any prospect of Flambeau demanding any compensation claim; which might have been sought even though the development materially contravened the development plan. </p>
 <p> <#> An appeal was made to Bord Pleanala by Flambeau Ltd and almost a year later, the Board finally made its decision confirming the County Council 's earlier ruling. <#> So once again, Red Rock had survived. </p>
 <p> <#> The amount of interest which this case had gathered in the region, was quite <}> <-> extra-ordinary. </-> <+> extraordinary </+> </}> </p>
 <p> <#> Among the organisations who opposed the development of Red Rock, were the Baily Residents Association, Howth; Glencarrig Residents Association, Sutton; The Howth and Sutton Residents Association; The Strand Road Residents Association and of course, An Taisce. </p>
 <p> <#> An unusual factor in Bord Pleanala 's decision in the Flambeau case, is recalled by Michael O'Neill; <quote> <#> ""It was decided that the environmental quality of St. Finton 's Road would be taken away from the development. <#> This is the only occasion I have ever seen the Board consider the environmental quality of a road in a planning appeal decision"". </quote> </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> ""The McGuinness Development"". </ul> <#> (See Map 3). </h>
 <p> <#> The Red Rock cases acted as a <quote> ""testing of the new boy"" </quote> in the sense that they represented the County Council 's first two important planning decisions on the peninsula. <#> With regards to public opinion, they had fared averagely. <#> They had bowed down to compensation threats in the Family Properties decision, but had stood firm in the Flambeau ruling. </p>
 <p> <#> Red Rock had also resulted in the formation of an army of pressure groups ready to defend their local area from the <quote> ""evils of development"". </quote> <#> Red Rock had seen these mobilise in the form of protest marches. <#> The publicity which the conflict had achieved had resulted in conversation being on a growing number of local residents. </p>
 <p> <#> In June 1989, permission was sought by a local builder, Michael Hayes, for the demolition of a cottage situated on the East Mountain and for its replacement with a new residence. <#> It later emerged that Mr. Hayes was <quote> ""fronting"" </quote> for Mr. Gerry McGuinness, the founder of the ""Sunday World"" newspaper. <#> The application plans revealed that the proposed ""replacement"" residence for the cottage, consisted of a <quote> ""ranch-style luxury house"", </quote> (Irish Times 15th September, 1989), containing an <quote> ""open-air swimming pool"". </quote> <#> Nonetheless, the development received planning permission in mid August. <#> This decision was unusual especially with regards to the County Council Planning Officers ' decision. <#> Ms. Grainne Mallon, who dealt with the application, decided that no <quote> ""material contravention"" </quote> of the 1980 Dublin City Development Plan would exist if permission was given. <#> Considering that the only residential development which would not constitute a <quote> ""material contravention"" </quote> would be a ""replacement"" of the existing structure, it seems inconceivable that such a <quote> ""ranch-style luxury home"" </quote> could have been deemed a ""replacement"" residence for a humble cottage. <#> Public outrage followed. <#> A public protest walk to the East Mountain and the formation of an East Mountain Action Group, conveyed the public opinion to the Co.

 <h> <ul> <#> CHAPTER 1 THE BACKGROUND </ul> </h>
 <h> <ul> <#> 1.1 INTRODUCTION </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> A brief study into the background of the funeral directing industry is necessary, in order to show how <}> <-> todays' </-> <+> today 's </+> </}> business has evolved. <#> In a relatively short period of time (two hundred years at the most), the act of burying the dead, in this part of the world, has, from being a private, family run affair, become a recognized business form, competing for a market like any other commercial interest. </p>
 <p> <#> There have always been 'undertakers' of sorts operating in the confines of urban space. <#> It can be a dirty, smelly and altogether distressing task in dealing with the deceased, and as a consequence people have happily paid others to carry out various tasks on their behalf. <#> However, the various tasks tended to be associated with different persons - the gravediggers, coffin makers, embalmers, doctors, churches etc. <#> The service supplied today <}> <-> accomodates </-> <+> accommodates </+> </}> all these different aspects, relieving the burden of organisation from private households. </p>
 <p> <#> Before the modern funeral business as we know it today, there were three distinct recognizable stages of <}> <-> its' </-> <+> its </+> </}> development. <#> Over time, it became manner of form that various vital functions changed hands. <#> Gradually a new profession evolved, incorporating a greater number of services as time went on. <#> The following pages examine this development in greater detail. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> 1.2. (i) THE BEGINNINGS - PRE 1800 </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> Coffins as we know them first made their appearance towards the end of the seventeenth century. <#> Before that time the dead were buried in shrouds or within hollowed out tree trunks. <#> Lead lined caskets did exist but these were a <}> <-> priviledge </-> <+> privilege </+> </}> of the wealthier classes and clergy. </p>
 <p> <#> In the majority of cases, funerals were the sole responsibility of the immediate family. <#> In Dublin, the name <it> undertaker </it> was in use in the early eighteenth century and like other trades, those engaged in it, operated in shops designated by a sign or symbol. <#> The exact service supplied by these undertakers is not so clear but they most likely provided some form of coffin. <#> ""Mortician"" is a word which slowly crept into usage in place of ""Undertaker"", a description which ousted ""Coffin-maker"". (1) </p>
 <p> <#> In newspapers as far back as 1736 and 1770, these undertakers advertised their <}> <-> their </-> </}> wares, such as Thomas Raper, a carpenter in Thomas Court, <quote> ""opposite St. <}> <-> Catherine,s </-> <+> Catherine 's </+> </}> "" </quote> selling <quote> ""Plain Oak Coffins, neatly furnished"" </quote> for sixteen shillings, whilst his highest price, for a <quote> ""Fully mounted Coffin, silvered, lined, and covered"" </quote> was <*> pound sign </*> 3.19s.7d. <quote> <#> ""Likewise"" </quote> the advertisement ran <quote> ""deal coffins, of all sizes, ready made"". </quote> (2) </p>
 <p> <#> Thirty years before the appearance of that advertisement, the parish carpenter of St. Catherines made coffins as is mentioned in the following news item taken from <ul> Faulkner 's Dublin Journal: </ul> <quote> ""Last week, the wife of one Kiskeen, in St. Catherine 's Parish, who had been sick above a fortnight, expired in all appearances, was washed, and stretched, and lay lifeless above for four hours, but when the poor parish carpenter came to take make of her for a coffin, the poor woman groaned and breathed and immediately came to herself, since which time she is perfectly recovered. </p>
 <p> <#> ""This is the second time she hath disappointed her loving husband in the same manner."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> The same paper had another story to report some six weeks later, this read: <quote> ""This week dyed (in earnest) the wife of one Kiskeen, who was twice ready to be buried formerly, but to her loving husband 's disappointment came to life. <#> Fearing the like accident might happen again, he immediately put her into a coffin, had it nailed up buryed her the next day"". </quote> (3) </p>
 <p> <#> The final years of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, saw the coffin makers setting up coffin yards in Cook Street. <#> Cook Street in the past had had other functions, being located in the oldest part of the city. <#> Three of the nearby streets have names which speak for themselves - Cook Street (more correctly <it> Vicus Cocorum, </it> ""the street of cooks""), Winetavern Street and Fishamble Street. (4) <#> Cook Street was to become for a time the main centre of the coffin trade, and its function was as supplier of coffins. <#> Normally their produce was shown on sale outside the premises for the bereaved to inspect, choose and buy a coffin, with which to carry out the burial. <#> The brilliantly lit coffin sheds with their clean smell of sawdust and new wood, open to the public, since people did not steal coffins which were unpawnable, contrasted <}> <-> favorably </-> <+> favourably </+> </}> with the dingy surroundings. (5) </p>
 <p> <#> It was from Cook Street that some of the oldest present-day undertakers, found their origins but it was not until later on in the nineteenth century that this new service became apparent. <#> Another advertisement tells us that Charles Mitchell had <}> <-> succeded </-> <+> succeeded </+> </}> to the business of D. Staunton, deceased, and he respectfully informed his friends and the public that <quote> ""he continues the coffin and shroud warehouse, at Number 14, Cook Street, Orders Daily Attended to"". <quote> (6) </p>
 <p> <#> According to one of the funeral directors spoken to during the field work stage, the Cook Street and Winetavern Street operations tended to cater for the working class slum/tenement areas of Dublin, the housing around Cook Street being particularly bad. <#> Almost a quarter of the buildings in the vicinity were in ruins or were vacant, and some sites were just waste ground. </p>
 <p> <#> <}> <-> Dublins' </-> <+> Dublin 's </+> </}> gentry at the time ignored the Cook Street produce, preferring instead to use coffins from Millar and Beatty 's, furniture makers, who had an outlet in Grafton Street up to the middle of the nineteenth century. </p>
 <p> <#> The demise of the Cook Street emporiums coincided with the emergence of the undertaking <ul> trade </ul> itself, as it started incorporating a more complete service on offer. <#> Out of a total of nineteen coffin-makers in Dublin in 1836, sixteen were in Cook Street. <#> In 1880, there were only five there out of a total of twenty five in the city as a whole. (7) <#> By this stage many of the coffin-making families were now employed by morticians in other parts of the city. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> 1.2. (ii) 1814-1900 <#> THE EMERGENCE STAGE. </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> The oldest funeral directing business in existence today is Nichols ' of Lombard Street, formerly of Lincoln Place. <#> Its initial function was quite limited, supplying horse drawn vehicles, for
 a) Hearses for funeral processions from church to graveyard, and
 b) Supplying hacks to the gentry for the hunting season.
 <#> Therefore in the early part of the nineteenth century the family (or whoever was organising the burial), purchased the coffin either from Cook Street or Grafton Street and arranged all other aspects of the funeral such as church services, grave openings and alike themselves. <#> The earliest firms, still in existence today, merely supplied a means of transport from the church to the various graveyards around Dublin at that time. <#> These included Mount Jerome, Glasnevin, Deans Grange or in local churches which had adjacent graveyards. </p>
 <p> <#> Gradually, the role of the mortician changed later into the nineteenth century. <#> Up to 1890, there were six main funeral directors in the city. <#> (Fanagans, Nichols, Farrells, Corrigans, Keogh Hendricks and Wallers). <#> These firms employed most of the coffin-making families who had previously been in Cook Street, such as the Kenny 's, Byrnes and Kellers. <#> The firms which had formerly provided a transport service had been otherwise known as <it> Job Carriage Proprietors </it> supplying hearses and men only. <#> By 1890, with the coffin-makers now working from private yards, they became known as <it> Complete Funeral Undertakers </it> supplying transport, coffins and immediate requisites such as burial clothing. </p>
 <p> <#> The choice of location of these new firms was very much limited by the size of property which could be obtained. <#> In order to carry out a very basic service, an undertaker required a yard which could cater for a minimum of half a dozen horses. <#> This may account for some firms changing their location. <#> Nichols moved in 1890 from Lincoln Place nearby Lombard Street because of an increasing demand on space. <#> More horses needed a greater sized area to live in, hence firms had to move to where they could acquire sufficient land. <#> There is no evidence to suggest that firms at this time changed location to benefit from a change in the socio-economic status of their clients. <#> In fact, firms usually changed location to within a short distance of the old premises. </p>
 <p> <#> It was also at this time that the general public began to recognise the funeral business as a separate profession. <#> Families adopted <}> <-> allegencies </-> <+> allegiances </+> </}> to particular firms, much in the same way as families do with doctors or solicitors. <#> This may have been due to the suitable location of a certain firm, or, the type of clientele which regularly used the firm. <#> Religion and class status would certainly have been a factor. </p>
 <p> <#> What is undisputed is that the <}> <-> funerals </-> <+> funeral </+> </}> businesses at this time were extremely busy. <#> Death rates were, in places, exceptionally high and <}> <-> lead </-> <+> led </+> </}> to enormous pressure on the graveyards of Dublin. <#> The two main cemeteries, Glasnevin and Mount Jerome, both report huge numbers of interments at this time. <#> Glasnevin had interments of all religions - the first important burial there had been of a Protestant, Edward Ruthven, a colleague of O'Connell - the majority of Protestants chose the exclusive Mount Jerome. <#> The proportion of burials reflected the sectarian divide. <#> By 1900, there were something like 1,000 burials a year at Mount Jerome. <#> Around 4,000 paid-burials took place annually at Glasnevin, while between 2,500 and 3,000 paupers were interred in <quote> 'Poor Ground'. </quote> (8) </p>
 <p> <#> There were only six firms to carry out the large number of funerals in the city at this time. <#> This must have lead to a shortage of resources at crucial times. <#> George Bernard Shaw described how slow moving funeral carriages, once out of sight of houses and shops, galloped to the cemetery gates before slowing down once more, became an amusing feature of Dublin life at this time. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> 1.2. (iii) <#> THE TWENTIETH CENTURY </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> The great advantage that the funeral business had over other firms which primarily offered a local service was that it was transport based. <#> It could go beyond the limits of other business types to carry out a 'contract' without having to incur the expense of opening up premises elsewhere. <#> Also the vast majority of Dublin 's population lived between the two canals, not requiring further expansion. <#> If a burial had to take place outside of the usual operating area, it was within the scope of the firm to be able to carry out. </p>
 <p> <#> Gradually, the number of funeral firms began to increase. <#> This was at a time when the absolute numbers living in Dublin was also increasing. <#> This is examined in detail in the next chapter. </p>
 <p> <#> The third phase of the <}> <-> trades' </-> <+> trade 's </+> </}> development was as a result of the widespread introduction of the telephone. <#> It had a number of effects on the firm - customer relationship. <#> For the first time funerals could be arranged over the telephone and this <}> <-> lead </-> <+> led </+> </}> to the firms offering a more complete service to that of before. <#> This included the insertion of death notices into the morning and evening newspapers, the supplying of floral tributes and the responsibility of opening a grave in the desired cemetery. </p>
 <p> <#> Inevitably, throughout this century, the motor vehicle has replaced the horse as being the main form of transport. <#> Medical procedures regarding the treatment of remains has become far more advanced and far more widespread. <#> Almost without exception, coffins are no longer made on the premises of funeral directing firms. <#> This task is now carried out by separate firms who can concentrate wholly on this aspect, and drive the per unit cost of manufacture lower. <#> Funeral firms now purchase ready made coffins from these firms and assemble, apply a finish and line the interior of the coffins themselves. </p>
 <p> <#> It would be foolish however, to suggest that it was the telephone and technical advances which were the main factors in the spatial development of the funeral business this century. <#> Throughout this time, Dublin has been changing in terms of its size, shape and form. <#> It is this, above all else, which has dictated the spatial changes in location of the funeral business as we know it today. </p>

 <h> <#> Will Aras soon get a new tenant? </h>
 <p> <#> AT a time when Ireland is facing a period of renewed uncertainty over the peace process, the entire island clearly needs as much long-term political stability as possible. </p>
 <p> <#> Many people will therefore have been alarmed by speculation that President Mary Robinson may stand down when her term of office expires in 1997. </p>
 <p> <#> By common consent, Mrs Robinson has been one of the most outstanding presidents in the history of the state. </p>
 <p> <#> Her election four years ago may well have been an act of political serendipity, in that only a self-inflicted blow prevented Fianna Fail 's Brian Lenihan from securing the highest office in the land. </p>
 <p> <#> However, having topped the polls against all the odds, Mrs Robinson immediately set out to re-define the position of the presidency in modern Ireland. </p>
 <p> <#> She has succeeded in a way few could have predicted, and has helped to transform the image not only of her office but also of her country. </p>
 <p> <#> Mrs Robinson has travelled to every corner of Ireland, and has proved a particularly welcome visitor on this side of the border. </p>
 <p> <#> She has managed to establish a rapport with unionists which would have been almost unthinkable in the past, and also found the time to meet with Gerry Adams in west Belfast. </p>
 <p> <#> In addition, northerners from a wide variety of backgrounds have accepted invitations to attend functions at her official residence in Phoenix Park. </p>
 <p> <#> Mrs Robinson has also become a major figure on the world stage through her trips to Europe, the USA, Asia, Australia and most poignantly Somalia. </p>
 <p> <#> In particular, her discussions with Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace were of huge symbolic importance. </p>
 <p> <#> She will undoubtedly add to her long list of achievements before her term of office is completed. </p>
 <p> <#> Were she to allow her name to go forward for re-election, the outcome of the poll would be a mere formality. </p>
 <p> <#> Indeed, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael might well feel there would be little point in fielding a candidate against Mrs Robinson. </p>
 <p> <#> The possibility that she might rule herself out of the race has not so far been widely considered. </p>
 <p> <#> However, the fact is that Mrs Robinson has not yet committed herself to seeking a second seven-year spell at the Aras. </p>
 <p> <#> Just days ago, one of the USA 's most influential newspapers, the Boston-Globe, suggested that the president was a strong contender to emerge as the next Secretary General of the United Nations. </p>
 <p> <#> The outgoing Secretary General, Boutros Boutros Ghali, who is due to retire in 1996, had lengthy private talks with Mrs Robinson only last week. </p>
 <p> <#> Some sources have also suggested that the president could be in line for a seat at either the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg or the World Court in the Hague. </p>
 <p> <#> She may even feel she has had enough of the limelight, and want to spend more time with her family at their new home in Co Mayo. </p>
 <p> <#> Mrs Robinson is her own woman and must make up her own mind, but the simple truth is that Ireland needs her in the Phoenix Park. </p>
 <p> <#> She had accomplished much, but much still needs to be done. <#> A second term would allow her a unique opportunity to review and develop the constitutional role of the presidency. </p>
 <p> <p> Her continued presence at the head of the state would also reassure unionists during what still seems likely to be a crucial period in the history of the island. </p>
 <p> <#> For these and many other reasons, Mary Robinson must be the president to lead Ireland into the 21st century. </p>

 <h> <#> Churchill, Castledawson, and the Covenant </h>
 <p> <#> The Home Rule Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 11 April 1912. <#> The government remained formally committed to the principle of Irish unity. <#> Over the next few weeks, however, some ministers - in particular Winston Churchill - sent out conciliatory signals in the direction of the Ulster unionists. <#> The background is of some interest. <#> On 3 October 1911 Churchill had referred contemptuously to the <quote> 'frothings of Sir Edward Carson'. </quote> <#> He offered to address a pro-home rule demonstration in the Ulster Hall in Belfast on 8 February 1912, a venue where his father had once delivered a famous loyalist speech. <#> The Irish unionist leadership, considering itself to be grievously provoked, openly committed itself to preventing such a meeting in the Ulster Hall, though not elsewhere in the city and the hall was aggressively double-booked. <#> The message was clear: at this early stage in the crisis, Sir Edward Carson, a former Law Officer, was prepared to support irregular proceedings which might well lead to violence. <sp> 1 </sp> <#> He also revealed himself as being increasingly <quote> 'Ulsterized' </quote> in his political instincts, for the exposed minority of southern unionists were worried by this apparent lack of respect for the principle of free speech. <#> In the end, Churchill moved his meeting to Celtic Park and a very tense day passed off peacefully, except for a <quote> 'rush of irresponsible rowdies' </quote> towards Churchill 's car. <sp> 2 </sp> <#> But, as the <it> Irish Times </it>, which had disliked the methods employed <quote> 'on ethical grounds' </quote>, noted, the strength of Ulster unionist sentiment had been made clear: <quote> 'Churchill 's visit had merely served to emphasise facts which the Radical and Nationalist leadership were desperately anxious to conceal.' <sp> 3 </sp> </quote> <#> Sections of the Liberal leadership began to take Sir Edward Carson and his movement a good deal more seriously. </p>
 <p> <#> At the end of March 100,000 nationalists attended a pro-home rule demonstration in Dublin. <quote> <#> 'As decent a crowd of its kind' </quote> that could be <quote> 'found anywhere in the empire' </quote>, the <it> Irish Times </it> charitably claimed on 1 April. <#> Joe Devlin declared that, in comparison with this demonstration, <quote> 'the march past of the awkward squads in Belfast would be as a farthing candle in the sunshine'. </quote> <#> John Dillon proclaimed: <quote> 'The work of Oliver Cromwell is nearly undone.' <quote> <#> John Redmond struck a more positive note: <quote> 'The true purpose of [home rule] ... is to put an end ... to the disastrous and ruinous war which has gone on between Ireland and the Empire.' </quote> <#> In early April the awkward squads gave their reply in Belfast: 100,000 unionists were present at Balmoral. <#> Carson introduced Bonar Law, who was accompanied by seventy MPs from English and Scottish constituencies. <#> According to the <it> Irish Times </it> on 10 April: <quote> 'The most important feature was the turn out of the Unionist clubs. <#> The Orangemen are accustomed to processions ... there were thousands of others standing witness to their determination of their adherence to the cause of the union. <#> [This is] ... a direct answer to any taunting allegation that resistance to home rule is a fanatical movement fostered solely by the Orange Order.' </quote> <#> On 11 June T.G.R. Agar-Roberts, a Cornish Liberal MP suggested in the House of Commons the desirability of excluding the four heavily Protestant counties: Antrim, Down, Armagh, and Londonderry. <#> The unionists supported the Agar-Roberts amendment, but it was defeated on 14 June by 69 votes. <#> This indicated a certain fall in government support. <#> Carson chose to regard the defeat as <quote> 'a declaration of war', </quote> others felt that a reluctant government had been forced to act against its most profound inclination. <#> The <it> Irish Times </it> noted simply: <quote> 'It has been compelled to change its mind by Mr Redmond.' <sp> 4 </sp> </quote> <#> This was the context of a most dangerous development - a slide into large-scale sectarian communal violence in Ulster. <#> The unionists, albeit reluctantly, had been prepared to offer serious consideration to a scheme of partition: the government, or some of its members and supporters, had flirted with the idea and then turned away from it. <sp> 5 </sp> </p>
 <p> <#> On 29 June, a serious affray at Castledawson, County Londonderry, initiated a marked deterioration in the intercommunal relations. <#> A Presbyterian Sunday School excursion party largely composed of women and children and numbering about 500, was attacked by on William Craig, a member of a Hibernian bank which unluckily happened to be returning from a Maghera demonstration. <#> (At Maghera, ironically, there had been Protestant home rulers on the platform and much non-sectarian oratory.) <#> Craig dashed into the excursion party and seized a small Union Flag, attempting to drag it from a small boy who held on to it. <#> The local RIC officer, Sergeant Burchill, pushed Craig back, and was struck by several of the Hibernians. <#> A general row ensued, the excursion party was thrown into a confused mass, and blows were struck on both sides. <#> The violence escalated: there was large-scale stone-throwing and many of the Protestants armed themselves with forks, shovel shafts, and sticks. <#> The police decided to take decisive action: they brought out their rifles and fixed their swords. <#> Ruefully, the two antagonistic crowds decided to disband, but not before many of the children were terrified out of their wits. </p>
 <p> <#> Tales of the incident soon spread. <#> Inflamed Protestants regarded this attack upon children as an indication of the baseness of nationalist intent. <#> Catholics felt that the incident had been greatly exaggerated by local Protestants; in particular, they criticized the role of the Revd Robert Barren, who had been superintending the Presbyterian excursion. <#> The Belfast presbytery indignantly repudiated charges of exaggeration. <#> The <it> Witness </it> declared of Castledawson: <quote> 'Its real importance lies in the view that it points to the difference between the Hibernians and other nationalists and their professed leaders.... <#> We have said that it did not matter what the leaders said: it was what the rank and file thought and said which should be the dominating factor.<sp> 6 </sp> <#> At the same time there was undoubtedly a certain exploitation of the Castledawson affray. <#> When the Revd J. D. Craig Houston told the Presbyterian assembly that they should not use the outrage for political purposes, <quote> 'So we do!' </quote> cried the ranks of this normally staid body. <sp> 7 </sp> <#> For offences connected with Castledawson twenty-three Hibernians and seven Protestant defendants were convicted and each sentenced to a term of three months ' imprisonment with hard labour for riot and unlawful assembly. <#> The seven Protestant defendants in the same case were acquitted. <sp> 8 </sp> <#> For Protestants this verdict proved where the responsibility lay; for Catholics it proved merely the partiality of the judiciary. <#> On 8 January 1913 a Memorial praying for remission of the unexpired period of the sentence imposed on the Hibernians was signed by a large number of Castledawson residents of all classes and professions - unionists, Conservatives, nationalists, Orangemen, Liberals, and clergymen of all denominations - and sent to the Lord Lieutenant. <#> Amongst the signatories were the Revd Mr Tarleton, rector of Castledawson, the Revd Mr Lindsay, rector of Magherafelt, and Alexander Clarke, JP, the proprietor of the large linen factory at Castledawson. <#> The signatories were surprisingly representative on a cross-community basis: there were six Catholic clergymen as against three Protestants, but, on the other hand, there were ten unionist professional men as against nine Catholics. <#> Given the immense bitterness occasioned by the incident in the Protestant community, it is important to note that the spirit of harmony and conciliation was by no means extinguished. <#> The complete synopsis <sp> 9 </sp> of the signatures to the Memorial in the table below makes interesting reading. </p>
 <&> table inserted </&>
 <p> <#> Mr Justice Wright, who presided at the trial, in reporting on the Memorial, expressed his opinion that there could be no doubt of the righteousness of the verdict, adding that he had carefully considered the case before passing sentence and that he saw no reason to recommend any reduction of the sentence of three months ' imprisonment with hard labour which he had imposed. <#> This was not a sentiment which was shared at the highest level in Dublin Castle. <#> On 4 February the Lord Lieutenant, with the support of the Chief Secretary, made an order that the twenty-three prisoners convicted and sentenced should be released on 5 February 1913: they had served only half their sentences. The <it> Weekly Northern Whig </it> bitterly noted in an editorial of 15 February; <quote> 'Stripped of all casuistry the plain fact remains that the Government is under the thumb of the Hibernians.' </quote> <#> The pamphlet <it> Ulster Protest </it> added: <quote> 'Such is the meaning of Mr Redmond 's perfectly true statement that Mr Devlin is the real Chief Secretary of Ireland.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Few, however, believed that the government had acted purely out of considerations of abstract legality. <#> The political context is all too clear: the by-election in Londonderry City on 30 January 1913 was narrowly carried by the Scottish Presbyterian Liberal, David Clegthorn Hogg, a large local employer, over Lt. Col. Hercules Arthur Pakenham (unionist) by 2,699 votes to 2,642. <#> Not surprisingly, the Irish party presented the victory and the choice of a Presbyterian candidate as great proof of the non-sectarianism of Catholic politics. <#> At Hogg 's celebratory dinner, Redmond offered a limited olive branch to unionists - he was prepared to offer them an influence in an Irish parliament greater than their numbers warranted. <#> Such rhetoric was soon to be undermined by allegations in the <it> Pall Mall Gazette </it> concerning the inner history of the Derry election. <#> It was claimed that the Hibernian factions in the city had made a deal with the government before they consented to vote for the Liberal candidate. <sp> 11 </sp> <#> Patrick Arkins, a Clare peasant sent down for seven years by Justice Dodd for an agrarian offence (knocking down a wall), was to be set free after three months; also to be freed were the Castledawson prisoners. <#> The government kept the bargain - shortly after the Derry result Arkins and the <}> <-> Castlesdawson </-> <+> Castledawson </+> </}> men were released. <#> Perhaps Birrell had not entirely suppressed his memory of these events when he referred drily in his memoirs to the <quote> 'near impossibility' </quote> of any English government dispensing <quote> 'even handed justice' <sp> 12 </sp> </quote> in Ireland. </p>
 <p> <#> But long before their eventual release the behaviour of the Castledawson nationalists had rebounded negatively on the nationalist minority in Belfast. <#> As the stories of Castledawson reached Belfast, loyalists contemplated savagely the attack on their women and children: some of the children at Castledawson were those of Belfast shipyard workers. <sp> 13 </sp> <#> Inflamed, some at once turned to violence and revenge. <#> From July onwards, at the shipyards and in their immediate vicinity, assaults were committed on Catholics and also on Protestant liberals and home rulers. <#> These assaults were so serious and there was such a degree of intimidation of Catholic workers that about 2,000 of them left their employment at the shipyards. <#> When the July holidays (the 'Twelfth') started, not more than a hundred Catholics remained in the shipyard.<sp> 14 </sp> <#> Southern unionists were embarrassed by the events. <#> They felt themselves to be in <quote> 'a sense outsiders', <sp> 15 </sp> </quote> , confronted by such <quote> 'inflexible contempt of opponents'. </quote> <quote> <#> 'It is not for us to live as vividly in the past or map the future with such arrogant confidence.' </quote> <sp> 16 </sp> </p>
 <p> <#> It was hoped that passions would diminish over the July holidays, but this did not happen. <#> By the end of July Harland and Wolff (whose owner Lord Pirrie was a recent convert to home rule from the ranks of liberal unionism) felt compelled to act; it threatened to lay off its entire 17,000-strong workforce unless the Catholic workers were re-admitted. <sp> 17 </sp> <#> George Clark, the managing director of Workman and Clark, which employed 9,000, appeared to be less sympathetic to the plight of the Catholic workforce: they had been <quote> 'easily frightened' </quote> <sp> 18 </sp> he declared tactlessly. <#> This provoked the <it> Leader </it> to a bitter attempt at verse in mid-February 1914: <quote> <#> The senior director of Workman and Clark This lack of true grit in the Papists did mark <#> He deemed that each Papist in courage was slack <#> Who left with a murderous mob at his back. </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Workman and Clark was not the only firm to attract such critical comment. <#> The Sirocco engineering works appeared to be equally culpable. <sp> 19 </sp> <#> A South Bucks. working man 's delegation reported eighteen months later:
 <quote> <#> On Thursday [29 January] our first visit was to the Sirocco Works, where we were received by Mr Davidson, the proprietor. <#> He remarked that only about fifty Catholics were employed, and explained that in consequence of the shipyard and other disturbances in 1912, he made an arrangement with the Protestants that if they agreed to work with the older hands among his Catholic employees he would employ more in the future. <#> The unionist workmen, Mr Davidson assured us, kept him regularly to this bargain. <sp> 20 </sp> </p> </quote>
 <p> <#> Both George Clark and S. C. Davidson were to serve on the Financial and Business Committee of the Ulster provisional government: on the other hand Lord Pirrie 's threat cooled passions and led to an improvement: many Catholic employees felt able to return to work. <#> But as late as 28 September 1912 the <it> Weekly Freeman 's Journal </it> noted sadly: <quote> <#> 'It must be remembered, however, that none of the expelled Catholics and Home Rulers have been taken back at Workman and Clark 's. <#> Some time ago it was rumoured that some had gone back there but it appears the rumour was groundless.' </quote> <#> There was to be a messy and unsatisfactory aftermath in the courts. <#> The police noted: <quote> <#> 'The various cases for the disturbance at the shipyards and other places during the summer of 1912 were heard at the Assizes this month. <#> Notwithstanding that the judge charged strongly in each case for a conviction most of the defendants were acquitted.' <sp> 21 </sp> </quote> <#> Unsurprisingly many nationalists contrasted this leniency with the fate of the Castledawson Hibernians. </p>

 <h> <#> Are you paying more tax then necessary? </h>
 <p> <#> More than 28 million people in the United Kingdom are paying more tax than they need to. </p>
 <p> <#> Last year alone, we handed over in excess of <*> pound sign </*> 5 billion to the Inland Revenue which could have been avoided if our affairs had been arranged more tax efficiently. </p>
 <p> <#> Without this contribution, the Chancellor would have had to raise the basic rate to 26.5p to collect the same amount. </p>
 <p> <#> This startling information was recently revealed in research commissioned by IFA Promotion Ltd. <#> Using the latest available Inland Revenue data, the report isolated almost <*> pound sign </*> 1 billion of tax paid in error; <*> pound sign </*> 1.3 billion which could have been easily avoided; and, over <*> pound sign </*> 3 billion which could have been saved by implementing rather more complex tax-saving strategies. </p>
 <p> <#> The largest are of tax ""waste"" (over <*> pound sign </*> 5 billion) can be traced back to people not claiming their allowances. <#> Income which should fall within their tax-free allowance ends up being taxed. </p>
 <p> <#> Waste occurs when married couples, with one partner earning more than the other, do not use their allowances to best effect. <#> If one spouse pays tax and the other doesn't, a switch of income into the non-taxpayers name would mean that the income would go from being taxed to tax-free. </p>
 <p> <#> With the married couples allowance now fully transferable, higher earning wives can achieve a greater slice of tax-free income, while the widening of the 20 per cent tax band also offers scope for tax saving. </p>
 <p> <#> Bank and building society accounts also provide fertile ground for tax waste. <#> Deposits with banks and buildings society are taxed, at source, at the 25 per cent rate. </p>
 <p> <#> Those people paying tax at the 20 per cent rate can claim a refund of 5 per cent while non-taxpayers can ask for the interest to be paid gross. <#> But an estimated <*> pound sign </*> 360 million tax was paid last year by people who have either failed to register for gross interest or failed to reclaim the tax overpaid. </p>
 <p> <#> A further <*> pound sign </*> 550 million could have been savvied if a greater number of banks and building society investors had made use of the Tax Exempt Special Savings Account (TESSA). <#> The TESSA allows savings (up to <*> pound sign </*> 3,000 in the first year and up to <*> pound sign </*> 9,000 over five years) to grow tax free as long as they are held for the full five year period. </p>
 <p> <#> Shareholders, both those holding equities direct or via a unit trust or investment trust, are wasting an estimated <*> pound sign </*> 750 million in tax. </p>
 <p> <#> A small part of this total results from non-taxpayers failing to reclaim the tax paid on their dividends, but the largest proportion stems from insufficient use being made of the Personal Equity Plan (PEP). </p>
 <p> <#> The PEP allows up to <*> pound sign </*> 9,000 worth of equities to be held in a tax-free environment each year. <#> The savings in one year, while perhaps only marginal for the basic rate taxpayer, can mount up considerably over a period of time. </p>
 <p> <#> The potential savings are obviously enhanced for the higher rate taxpayer. <#> And yet, of up to 13 million share or unit trust holders, some 9.9 million have no PEP at all. </p>
 <p> <#> Please remember that the levels and bases of taxation can change. <#> The reliefs referred to are those that currently apply and the value of relief from taxation is dependent on individual circumstances. <#> In addition, you must bear in mind that the value of shares and units can fall as well as rise and the return may be less than the amount investment. </p>
 <p> <#> Inheritance tax is a particularly nasty tax in that it is levied on assets which have been accumulated with income that has already been taxed. </p>
 <p> <#> The one thing in its favour, however, is that by utilising wills, life policies, gifts and the annual exemptions available, its impact can be largely mitigated. </p>
 <p> <#> Few people though, plan ahead for inheritance tax and, as a result the Inland Revenue takes in around <*> pound sign </*> 1.3 billion every year from this source. </p>
 <p> <#> Another area of waste can be attributed simply to mistakes made by the Inland Revenue. </p>
 <p> <#> There are by no means infallible, but too many people accept what the Revenue say <}> <-> the </-> <+> they </+> </}> owe without checking the figures. <#> Random checking by the Inland Revenue in 1992/93, in an effort to find tax fiddlers, revealed some <*> pound sign </*> 270 million of tax overpaid, but this is obviously just the tip of the iceberg. <#> A further <*> pound sign </*> 170 million could be saved if people declared all their income and paid their tax bills on time thereby avoiding penalties, which can be severe. </p>
 <p> <#> Areas of potential tax savings abound. <#> There are still many people for whom it would be tax efficient to contract out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) while over <*> pound sign </*> 100 million could be saved by using the products of the Department for National Savings more effectively. </p>
 <p> <#> The tax treatment of life assurance products, particularly friendly society policies, could again save more than <*> pound sign </*> 100 million per year. </p>
 <p> <#> Nobody likes paying tax, so it makes sense to cut out as much of the waste as possible. <#> Impartial, independent financial advice from someone well versed in the tax planning field is essential if you are to make the most of the opportunities available. </p>

 <h> <#> AFTER THE MATCH </h>
 <p> <#> They burst into the reception hall of Old Woodleigh, fists raised in triumph, the growing <it> waaahh </it> sound which had been audible from a distance now deepening, distorting their faces as they fell <it> en masse </it> through the double doors. <#> The opposition had been trounced in a stunning display of muscle and airborne muck at the Leinster Schools Rugby Final. </p>
 <p> <#> Helen stood with Doreen and Katy, the wives of two other Bellemont teachers. <it> <#> Waaahhh </it> ...<#> The women shifted uncomfortably, taking pointedly casual sips from their drinks as they watched the boys close in around the two trainers. <#> Helen studied Adam 's face. <#> He was in seventh heaven. <#> This was the moment when all the extra time spent training the young beasts - the late nights, the pep-talks and sessions which had intensified during the last, vital weeks - suddenly added up. <#> She was pleased for him, the happy glow on his face some sort of pay off. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Isn't if marvellous for them!' </quote> Doreen giggled over the G and T, adjusting a frothy pink blouse at the neck as the tangle of cheering bodies suddenly shifted in their direction. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Absolutely!' </quote> Katy agreed. <quote> <#> 'You must both be thrilled skinny.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Oh it 's great to see them win. <#> As a mother I know just what it means to the boys,' </quote> Doreen said, eyes shining with pleasure. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Aren't you thrilled, Helen?' </quote> said Katy again, more for something to say than in true speculation. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Delighted. <#> Delighted,' </quote> said Helen, distracted by the whooping and back-slapping. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Of course it 's your first time so it 'll seem very new,' </quote> Doreen whispered. <quote> <#> 'But when Adam has worked with Patrick and brought them through like this a few more times, you 'll take it all in your stride. <#> I know when Patrick started training I was so nervous you wouldn't believe it. <#> I mean you want them to win, you wish so desperately for everything to work out.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Well it has anyway.' </quote> <#> Helen was vague, uncertain of her humour. </p>
 <p> <#> Patrick and Adam were hoisted shoulder-high, good-humouredly tolerating the heaving the jostling. <#> The parents of the players mingled with the group, not quite at the centre of the knot of bodies but near enough to be hugged and kissed by sons who were out of their minds with joy. <#> One of the boys forced the cup, a well-dented trophy chased in silver in gold, into Adam 's hands. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Ah, lads, I can't balance!' </quote> he shouted, raising the cup unsteadily. <#> They roared again and took off at a lumbering gallop around the hall. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Easy now lads!' </quote> Patrick called. <#> Nobody heard. <#> He was older than Adam, his face finely-lined, more assured. </p>
 <p> <#> Flustered helpers tried to seat the jubilant mob. <#> Waiters and serving women signalled, ignored until a few of the parents and most of the teachers made their way to the dining area. <#> The boys followed untidily. <#> Helen groaned as one of them started the school rallying song again. <#> It was rapidly taken up as they filtered through. <#> She was starving. <#> The afternoon on the terraces at Lansdowne had been freezing, hail and wind whipping in under the stand till they were drenched. <#> They were proper ninnies to have taken so much trouble with their appearances, she thought, observing the other women. <#> Like fresh, dewy flowers, individually not so interesting, but as a group colourful and strangely expectant. <#> Like girls at their first party. <#> The older ones were muffled in furs and fine wool. <#> Because it was a day which had promised victory, she 'd had her hair plaited, and wore a new navy and green dress bought specially for the occasion. <#> It had cost too much but she liked it and Adam would find the effect exotic and interesting among all the matrons. </p>
 <p> <it> <#> 'Womba, womba, womba,' </quote> </it> the slow chant began. <#> She tried to look benevolent and pleasant as she took her seat and watched the team and their followers crash their way down along the tables. <italic> <#> 'Ing-gang-oolie-oolie-oolie-oolie,' </quote> </it> they growled, reminding her of visiting rugby teams from New Zealand whose ritual dance was intended to intimidate the opponents. <#> One of the boys grabbed a seat opposite her and sat down, panting. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Jaysus!' </quote> he gasped, blinking in her direction, but she realised that he wasn't looking at her so much as drifting in and out of some hallucinatory and highly-pleasured dream. <it> <#> 'Ing-gang-goo.' </quote> </it> </p>
 <p> <#> To her right a restless middle-aged man with lightly-tanned skin shifted continually in his seat. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Hello, I 'm Helen Kilroy.' </quote> <#> She introduced herself, decided she 'd best make an effort and be sociable. <#> The bane of her life. <#> Being sociable. <#> Making an effort for the sake of civility. <#> He looked at her for a moment, surprised at her presence, not expecting to be addressed. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Oh. <#> How d'you do? <#> McElligot. <#> Jim,' </quote> he mumbled, extending his hand. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'You 've a son on the team, right?' </quote>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Wrong. <#> Nephew,' </quote> he said, looking over her shoulder and waving at somebody. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Good man Delaney! <#> Knew you 'd do it, ya bloody hound!' </quote> he bellowed, taking a slug from a glass of wine. <it> <quote> <#> 'Chow-chow-chow,' </quote> the call went, its barking rhythm strengthening. <#> Helen tried again. <#> For Adam 's sake she must make an effort to be amenable. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Oh yes, I remember the boy - Ciaran McElligot is your nephew.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Got it in one!' </quote> he said, before stopping suddenly. <quote> <#> 'But... but...my God, I 've just realised who you are!' </quote> <#> He sat back, absorbing her from head to toe as if she were a vision. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'I do apologise Mrs Kilroy...Helen, that what you said?...<#> The way things are today, I don't know what 's happening. <#> Super isn't it, you must be so proud of Adam, delighted with yourself, what?' </quote> </p>
 <p> <it> <#> 'Womba, womba, womba.' </quote> </it> <#> She wondered how to counter the flood of hyperbole. <#> How pleased did she have to be, how could she convey her pleasure, that yes, it was wonderful? </p>
 <p> <#> To her left, Doreen chattered to somebody 's father. <#> She was cut out for it, Helen thought, remembering the chocolate eclairs and apple-tarts which Doreen had ferried to the team the evening before every match. <quote> <#> 'I really feel for them,' </quote> she was saying, staring wide-eyed at the man. <quote> <#> 'It 's so hard for them in a boarding-school. <#> I find they really need something to remind them that we all care, that somebody really, really cares.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Oh you 're quite right, quite right,' </quote> the man replied. </p>
 <p> <#> The poor bugger was bored stiff. <#> Helen peered over Doreen 's shoulder and into his eyes. <#> He caught the look and in the flicker of an instant almost responded, stifling a smile. <#> She looked away then. <#> No joy there. <#> <it> Homo domesticus </it> if ever she saw him. <#> Common-or-garden species. <#> Widespread in the British Isles. <#> Shed its inhibitions only during summer migration. <#> Likes the company of its own sex. <#> Probably saves his charm for the rugby tours. <#> Miles away from solicitous wives. <#> Still. <#> Best not start messing. <#> For Adam 's sake. <#> Best behave and keep her talents for the home front or circles where they wouldn't be misinterpreted. <#> This was no place for wit and irony. <#> Or so much as a hint of sex. <it> <#> 'Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak,' </it> the boys roared. <it> <#> 'Come on, Bellemont, win it back!' </it> <#> The <it> 'Waaaahh' </it> sound rose again as they finally settled down, plastic chair scraping and hacking on the wooden floor. </p>
 <p> <#> Adam and Patrick sat like young bulls, penned off at the top table, surrounded by priests, the headmaster and various significant supports, including the priest who had once found her bathing naked with Adam in the school swimming-pool. <#> Adam had been raging afterwards. <#> Hadn't he told her not to strip, but no, she 'd insisted, determined to tease, and had even tried to rip his swimming-trunks off, just as Goggle-face walked in. <#> The thought of it made her suddenly splutter with laughter. <#> The McElligot man scrutinised her. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'God but it 's a tremendous occasion,' </quote> he muttered to her, as if testing her sanity. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'God but it is,' </quote> she replied glibly, giggling again in recollection of the priest 's bland face as she 'd waded to the side of the pool in an attempt to conceal her flesh. <#> Word inevitably got around. <#> A black mark. <#> A man who couldn't control his wife in certain situations was open to question. </p>
 <p> <#> During the meal, people were absorbed in the post-mortem: the earnest dissection of every moment of play, comparisons with previous finals leading to disputes, jokes, noisy debate. <#> She could think of a million and one more interesting topics, even if it was their special rugger day. <#> Hadn't she shown interest in other people, even in the brat sitting opposite, hadn't she tried a variety of conversational options, from current affairs to UEFA and British soccer hooligans, the Olympics? <#> Of course it wasn't necessary to say anything to that lot. <#> She glared balefully at her soup. <#> More a matter of making the right sounds, little-woman chat. <#> She listened to Doreen. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Well of course education is important, it 's one of the most important things any parent can give a child!' </quote> she was saying with vehemence. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Quite. <#> The wife and I like to take certain decisions too. <#> All in all some guidance is needed and the discipline which rugger adds is damn well unbeatable,' </quote> the man beside her said. </p>
 <p> <#> 'Discipline?' </quote> she cut in over Doreen 's shoulder. <quote> <#> 'What do you mean by discipline?' </quote> she asked, putting on an interested face, hand curling under her chin. <#> The man looked extremely surprised. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Aaah! <#> Discipline? <#> Discipline 's discipline any way you look at it: the boys have to be ready to forge good careers, stand up for themselves, go for it in a tough world, that type of thing...' </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> A waiter slid a plate of turkey and ham before her, then another slammed a heap of mashed potatoes and liquidised sprouts on top of the meat. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'You mean externalised discipline?' </quote> Helen asked, determined to be awkward. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'What? <#> Beg pardon?' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'The ability to kow-tow to authority and suchlike - a bit like doing things without asking why?' </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Doreen nodded her head in agreement and Helen was suddenly aware that she was listening intently. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'But what else is there?' </quote> Doreen asked. </p>
 <p> <#> The man started to hum and haw. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Asking why isn't always such a bally great thing, young woman, he commented, focusing at a point beyond her. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'You 'd drive yourself crazy if you were constantly questioning things, Helen,' </quote> said Doreen. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Is that so?' </quote> said Helen. </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Yes, and the long and the short of it for me is that they get such a lot out of the experience. <#> It stands to them, makes...' </quote> she searched for the word, <quote> '...it makes men of those boys.' </quote> </p>
 <p> <quote> <#> 'Well said, well said.' </quote> <#> The man applauded quietly with manicured hands. </p>
 <p> <#> The meal was over. <#> There was, she thought, little so say which would have made the slightest difference. <#> She glanced along the length of the table, making no effort to conceal an expression of boredom. <#> Katy was chirruping with some guy from the IRFU, Doreen was flirting with the disciplinarian, McElligot brayed joyfully over his wine, his nephew smiled like an imbecile and the muscular boy opposite, who told her he was a hooker and laughed, expecting her not to understand what the term meant, rocked backwards and forwards on his chair, spooning trifle into his flaccid mouth. <#> Adam and Patrick sat in the sanctuary of the top table. <#> Thank God Adam wasn't a yob, one of those aleckadoos. <#> At least the whole thing was a game for him, a sport. <#> Rugby was rugby was rugby and if people didn't know the difference between Phase One and Phase Two possession they could forget it. <#> Not for him the ribald tribalism that emanated from their opponents' dressing rooms prior to every match as trainers bullied mercilessly and told the team they couldn't generate a pint of piss between them. <#> That wasn't Adam 's style. <#> Instead, Patrick had been persuaded to adopt Adam 's half-baked meditation techniques, picked up as a result of some cursory reading and a trip to Bangkok some years back. <#> The Bellemont boys had been ribbed mercilessly, with 'Bellemont Boys Levitate' and 'A Try for the Maharishi' lashed across the evening papers. <#> All the more satisfying to prove them wrong, Helen thought, to see Adam have his glory. <#> She was nothing if not loyal. </p>
 <p> <#> McElligot wheeled back in his chair as the speeches began. <#> He had reached the point of no return, and lit a cigar, his hands unsteady. <#> The place was noisy: boys and fathers shouted and catcalled across the room; wives and mothers smiled in complicity, the <it> waaahh </it> sound threatening to erupt again until the headmaster raised his right arm in a plea for silence. </p>

 <h> <#> CHAPTER ONE </h>
 <h> <#> DECIDING WHO TO TREAT IN THE NHS </h>
 <p> <quote> <#> ""Assuming that a society has made some kind of decision as to how many kidney machines it will produce, how many soldiers it will need for a limited war, or how many births it can tolerate, how does it decide, explicitly or implicitly, who gets the kidney machines, who gets picked to serve in that limited war, who gets to have children?"" </quote> <#> Guido Calabresi (1) </p>
 <p> <#> It is widely recognised, but accepted with difficulty, that health services today have finite resources to cover an infinite demand for treatment. <#> Health care, despite provisions in the European Social Charter, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the Major Charter, is not the fundamental human right it is often thought to be, but instead must be rationed. <#> The term, ""rationing"", used frequently to refer to the distribution of provisions at times of war, conjures up for many, images of scarcity, unfairness or discrimination. <#> Indeed, it is these factors which give rise to most of the controversy relating to resource allocation, as people often feel that they have been unfairly treated - or not treated, as the case may be. </p>
 <p> <#> Doctors taking the Hippocratic Oath must be all too aware of the impossibility of <quote> ""giving their services for nothing"" <quote> and of <quote> ""serving one who is a stranger in financial straits."" </quote> (2) <#> Physicians have a part to play in making decisions involving the allocation of resources, although ultimately, this <}> <+> is </+> </}> up to the politician. <#> This is necessarily the case, as Dr. David Hadorn observes, because, <quote> <#> ""Physicians and other health care professionals are the only members of society with a broad enough perspective to estimate and compare the quality of life effects of different medical treatments."" </quote> (3) </p>
 <p> <#> The cost of highly sophisticated, modern, medical technology is just one ironic reason why health authorities cannot afford to fund all necessary treatment: they spend money on this new equipment and consequently cannot afford to administer basic treatment to everyone. <#> Another reason is that people are now living longer, and the elderly constitute the largest group of health care consumers. </p>
 <p> <#> The problem, then, lies in the weighing-up of the arguments. <#> Is the limited money better spent, for example, on hip replacement operations for one hundred seventy-year-olds, or on neuro-surgery for two thirty-year-olds? <#> Should there be a cut-off age at which treatment for the elderly is stopped or refused? <#> Interestingly, such discussions were taking place as far back as the Nineteenth Century, as Bernard Shaw recounts in his <ul> Doctor 's Dilemma </ul> , where two doctors discuss the fate of two men both requiring the same treatment to save their lives. </p>
 <p> <#> Sir Patrick <#> <quote> ""Well, Mr. Saviour of lives: which is it to be? <#> That honest decent man Blenkinsop, or that rotten blackguard of an artist, eh?"" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Ridgeon <#> <quote> ""It 's not an easy case to judge, is it? <#> Blenkinsop 's an honest man; but is he any use? <#> Dubedat 's a rotten blackguard; but he 's a genuine source of pretty and pleasant and good things."" </quote> <(4) </p>
 <p> <#> Has the brilliant, but morally corrupt Dubedat got more right to the treatment
 than the good, but unremarkable Blenkinsop? <#> Decisions involve complex
 elements, such as the likelihood of the treatment 's success, whether there would be a
 great deal of pain, whether or not the family would be adversely affected, and whether
 or not the patient himself feels that the quality of life would be substantially
 improved. <#> Unfortunately, there are no easy answers to these questions, and no
 definitive method of measuring the very controversial area of priorities. </p>
 <p> <#> It must be accepted, therefore, that all of the people will not be able to have
 their treatment funded all of the time. <#> The question is rather, how can limited
 resources best be distributed to benefit most of the people most of the time? </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> Promises for those in the N.H.S. </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> Robert G. Evans, in his article, <ul> ""'Rationing' Health Care: The Loaded
 Alternative"" </ul> , described the NHS as seen through the eyes of hostile Americans
 as, <quote> <#> ""endless waits to see overworked and undertrained staff in obsolete and undermaintained facilities. <#> Patients may be denied life saving treatment if they are old or for other reasons fail to receive high enough priority for scarce services whose availability is controlled by heartless, or at least unaccountable beaurocrats."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> This criticism probably goes too far: facilities are hardly <quote> ""obsolete"" </quote> and nor can the decision-makers be described as <quote> ""heartless,"" </quote> but the system is certainly far from perfect. </p>
 <p> <#> Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that,
 <quote> <#> ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing and medical care."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> The Major charter established three basic rights emanating from the NHS Reforms, which were to come into effect in 1992: <quote> ""a right to health care on the basis of clinical need....a right to receive emergency medical care at any time....and a right to be guaranteed admission for treatment by a specific date no later than two years from the day when your consultant places you on a waiting list."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> This all appears very optimistic but seems to be based on an assumption that there is enough money to cater for treatment for everyone. <#> However, there is only a limited amount of money to pay for treatment to which everyone is apparently entitled, and this was recognised in the NHS Reforms, which, it was stated, <quote> ""could allow purchasers to allocate resources according to the patients ' capacity to benefit from care."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> This provision demonstrates the logical conclusion that finite resources must
 be rationed and allocated according to where they will do the most good. <#> So,
 there are rights to treatment, but these are in conflict with its cost. <#> As touched on
 previously, one of the reasons offered for this is the increasing attraction of new
 medical technology. <#> Sophisticated skills and tools are often procured at the cost
 of ""ordinary"" treatment, and what health services are capable of doing far exceeds
 what they can afford to do. <#> Time and money expended on one thing necessarily
 excludes the opportunity of spending them on something else, and clinicians now face
 the difficult task of deciding between the utility of innovations that modern science
 has created, which may save some gravely ill patients, and the advantage of providing
 everyone with at least basic treatment. </p>
 <h> <#> THE QUALITY OF LIFE </h>
 <p> <#> In the United Kingdom, unlike in Oregon, there is no legislation designed to
 assist the decision-maker in deciding who should be treated. <#> In the past, age, gender and moral worthiness have been used as factors in decision-making, but in a modern, supposedly equal society, such criteria are anachronistic and unfair. <#> The sole criterion derives from pure reason - that the money should be spent where it will be most beneficial; but what is meant by <quote> ""most beneficial?"" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> A simplistic response would be that treatment is most worthwhile where it will save a life, or in other words, postpone a death. <#> However, this is not always the best solution. <#> If, for example, the victim of a serious car accident was so brain damaged that he or she had to have constant observation, was in chronic pain, breathed by means of a ventilator, was tube-fed and had lost all human dignity, would that person not perhaps be better off dead? </p>
 <p> <#> The recent case of two-year-old Thomas Creedon illustrates this point. <#> He is both deaf and blind, is thought to be in constant pain and is fed through a hole in his stomach. <#> Basically, his existence is being maintained by the marvel of medical technology, but does he have any sort of acceptable quality of life? <#> His parents, battling to allow the treatment to be terminated obviously do not think so, and indeed, it can be argued that the money spent to keep his body functioning just enough to keep him alive would be much more effectively spent elsewhere, if it meant that another patient 's quality of life could improve. </p>
 <p> <#> A similar issue arose in Laura Davies 's case. <#> This child had undergone treatment throughout her five years for a serious bowel complaint. <#> When it seemed that no cure could be found, her parents enquired about a transplant, but were discouraged by British doctors, since it was an experimental operation for children, and no-one had ever survived it for more than six months. <#> Despite this advice, Laura had two massive multi-organ transplants in America, at a cost of <*> pound sign </*> 1 million, before her death some months later. </p>
 <p> <#> There have been many criticisms of the parents of this tragic child, for forcing her to endure extra months, or perhaps years of gruelling treatment, knowing that there was virtually no chance of survival, instead of allowing her to die in relative comfort. </p>
 <p> <#> The two cases described above show a tendency of the physicians to favour quantity of life over quality. <#> However, it is more probable that the average person would rather have a high-quality short life than a long succession of years of suffering, with no light at the end of the tunnel. <#> There has been a recent attempt to incorporate both of these factors in decision-making, which will be discussed in the following section. </p>
 <h> <#> QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS </h>
 <p> <#> QALYs, an acronym for ""Quality Adjusted Life Years,"" constitute a principal aid to decision-making in the National Health Service. <#> The QALY incorporates the idea both of quality of life and quantity of life, and is derived from survival data and the value of different states of health. </p>
 <p> <#> Before discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the QALY, it is necessary to show exactly what it is and how it is calculated. <#> Alan Williams was at the source of the concept of QALYs. <#> He stated that, <quote> <#> ""the essence of a QALY is that it takes a year of healthy life expectancy to be worth 1, but regards a year of unhealthy life expectancy to be worth less than 1. <#> Its precise value is lower the worse the quality of life of the unhealthy person.....if being dead is worth zero, it is possible for a QALY to be negative, for the quality of someone 's life to be judged worse than being dead."" </quote> (5) </p>
 <p> <#> The methodology used to quantify QALYs was designed by Rosser and Kind. (6) <#> In their calculations, they incorporate distress and disability factors, establishing eight categories of disability and four distress ratings. <#> Disability ranges from 1 (no disability) to 8 (totally dependent and unconscious), while the four stages of distress are: A, none; B, mild; C, moderate and D, severe. <#> A group of seventy people were asked to combine all categories of distress and disability, to evaluate them, and the average scores were charted on a table as shown below. <#> They had to give an evaluation, based on a scale ranging from -1 to +1, so that a quality of life score of +1 indicates absence of suffering. </p>
 <&> table inserted </&>
 <p> <#> It is evident from this that QALY calculations necessarily involve a degree of arbitrariness. <#> The degree of distress and disability is measured by means of a general consensus - other people decide how much pain or disability they reckon is caused by a certain condition, many of whom will not ever have suffered the symptoms themselves. <#> This factor has given rise to much controversy concerning the justice and ethics of the QALY. </p>
 <p> <#> At first glance, the concept of the QALY seems like the best solution to any resource allocation problem. <#> Obviously treatment should be funded for the person who will obtain the best quality of life from it. <#> If faced, for example, with a thirty-year-old and an eighty-year-old, who both need a heart by-pass operation, the likelihood of its success being excellent for the younger person, promising him a normal life expectancy with minimal disability, but offering the older patient only another year of pain and suffering, the logical and reasonable response would be to give it to the younger patient. </p>
 <p> <#> In a perfect society, of course, all patients would be treated equally, and medicine would not take into account age, quality of life, or any other factor. <#> However, when the issue concerns economic deficiency, meaning that choices <ul> must </ul> be made, such idealism is unrealistic and impracticable. </p>
 <p> <#> Michael Lockwood states that the concept of the QALY is based on a welfarist element, saying that, <quote> ""other things being equal, it should be regarded as preferable to confer greater aggregate benefit than less."" </quote> <#> To him, it <quote> ""doesn't seem unjust to choose to treat the patient for whom treatment is more likely to prove successful."" </quote> (7) <#> This seems a fair statement, as long as extremes of situations are involved. <#> It is not difficult to see reasons for treating a young healthy patient before an elderly, infirm patient, or of treating a baby who will have a normal life expectancy with treatment than one with only another hour to live despite treatment. </p>

 <p> <#> My contribution to this publication first challenges the widely held opinion that Sylvia Plath was concerned only with self destruction in her work. <#> It proposes the notion that the driving force in her poetry and prose is an affirmative, recreative one which overcomes male dominance in life and literature. <#> Since Plath 's work is based almost exclusively on autobiography, it is vital to take a look at the circumstances of the life which shaped the work. <#> Therefore an outline of her life is presented, with an emphasis on my main theme in the chapter, <it> i.e.</it> the doubles and masks in Plath 's life. <#> This use of doubles in the life is next extended to her novel <it> The Bell Jar </it> and her last collection of poetry <it> Ariel, </it> where the doubles are overcome and ultimately the positive voice emerges supreme over the negative. </p>
 <p> <#> Sylvia Plath is known to many only as a cult figure who achieved her status with her suicide in February 1963. <#> Looked at in this light it is inevitable that her poems are seen as self destructive death wishes and suicidal ravings of a woman determined to die. <#> This is how <it> Ariel, </it> her last volume of poems written in the months before she died, is usually seen. <#> Critics have observed that the circumstances of her death have been the main contributing factor in seeing her life and work as being morbidly attracted to her death. </p>
 <p> <#> It is true to say that some of the poems in this collection are quite depressing and death-related in themselves. <#> Obviously poems written in the weeks immediately preceding her death reflect her suicidal tendencies at that time. <#> But the strength of the book, and its main driving force comes from the ""October"" poems. <#> Written in October 1963, they are the product of early morning writing sessions after her separation from husband, poet Ted Hughes. </p>
 <p> <#> These poems are positive affirmations of her new found independence. <#> She had overcome her depression at the initial break up and had found a positive voice. <#> They are poems of strength and rebirth. <#> She was elated by them herself and although people do interpret them as destructive because of the references to death, it is not death as destruction that she is concerned with. <#> Instead it is the death of the self which is necessary to preceded resurrection in a new recreated form. <#> As she comments in one such poem, ""Lady Lazarus,"" the dying and destruction are easy, it is the come-back and resurrection which are hard. <#> But ultimately it is that resurrection which <it> Ariel </it> concerns itself with and this is the driving force of the collection. </p>
 <p> <#> Although Plath had been writing, both poetry and prose, since she was very young, her earlier style is very artificial and shallow. <#> She aimed towards a commercial market, publishing pieces in magazines for payment - therefore her style varied to suit each particular magazine. <#> Only in later years did she find an authentic voice (acknowledged also by Ted Hughes in his introduction to her <it> Journals. </it> <#> Hence her appreciated work is not very extensive. <#> Besides her collections of poetry she published a novel, <it> The Bell Jar, </it> in 1963, just before her death. <#> This novel is famous for its detached, ironic account of her first breakdown and suicide attempt when she was twenty. <#> Although written in a fictionalized form, almost all of the characters and incidents in it are real. </p>
 <p> <#> Her work is based almost exclusively on autobiography and familiarising ourselves with the facts of her life gives us a huge insight into her work. <#> Aspects of her personality crop up constantly in her work - the most notable has to be the use of doubles. </p>
 <p> <#> In reading her journals, her poetry, her prose and reading various accounts of her life, it is easy to become bewildered by the array of personalities and conflicting doubles that one has to sift through to find the real Plath. <#> There are so many different faces presented - the calm confident high achiever versus the scared berating voice of the journals; the Sylvia who loved life to the full versus the destructive suicidal case; the longing to be an ordinary housewife and mother versus longing to be committed only to her art. </p>
 <p> <#> So we can see that the doubles and conflicting selves are the real issue of Plath. <#> This is the theme I wish to discuss, the double in the woman and the use of it in her work. <#> In doing so I will take examples from her life, her novel <it> The Bell Jar </it> and her final poetry collection <it> Ariel. </it> </p>
 <p> <#> Sylvia Plath was born October 27, 1932. <#> As the oldest child she was the centre of attention, particularly as her only brother Warren was a sickly boy. <#> Her father Otto Plath insisted that his daughter be treated as a unique personality and she was encouraged to achieve perfection in everything she did. <#> This is reflected later on in her life when she experienced severe mental distress if she could not live up to the high standards she set for herself. </p>
 <p> <#> In 1940 Otto Plath died after a long illness, leaving behind an eight year old daughter who had such h a strong emotional reaction to his death that it haunted her throughout the rest of her life. <#> It gave her both material for her poems and at least one reason for her first suicide attempt. <#> Although she was later to remark to friends in college that her father died while she still thought he was God, her attitude to him is not always this positive. <#> At times she hates him for the all-encompassing hold he has on her that she cannot shake off - the Electra complex. <#> Her attitudes to her father are traced and overcome in ""Daddy."" </p>
 <p> <#> The strange conflicting doubles that are so much a part of Sylvia become easier to detect once she leaves home for college in September 1950. <#> In her letters home we see a cheerful optimistic Sylvia, displaying almost childlike excitement and loving everything. <#> But this does not match with the tortured alienated voice of the journals as she constantly worried that her achievements were not good enough. <#> Her desire to succeed meant that she studied constantly and kept to a rigid schedule. <#> This rigid stance that she maintained in everything was necessary for her to contain the doubt ridden alienated Sylvia behind the calm smiling mask of the all round American girl. <#> The evidence from her years at Smith College show these constant fluctuations of mood from ecstatic highs to depressing lows. </p>
 <p> <#> At the end of her third year in Smith she spent the month of July guest-editing an important American magazine along with 19 other students. <#> Her experiences there are documented almost exactly as they happened in the first part of the <it> The Bell Jar. </it> <#> She often received criticism from her managing editor and this shook her confidence immensely. <#> It was the beginning of a downward spiral to her attempted suicide later in the summer. </p>
 <p> <#> The reasons for this attempt are apparently rather diverse. <#> The atmosphere at home, and particularly her relationship with her mother during that summer of '53, is presented as somewhat stifling. <#> This relationship appears very much the same love/hate one that she had with her father. <#> Sylvia resented all the sacrifices her mother had made for her and felt that the burden of debt and gratitude it placed on her was overpowering. </p>
 <p> <#> Along with this resentment was her own sense of failure, loss of belief in her own self worth and her conviction that she was going mad. <#> The account of the actual attempt in <it> The Bell Jar </it> is very poetic and is a further extension of the calm, often humorous way that she presents her whole breakdown experience. <#> Again it is evidence of the double in Plath. </p>
 <p> <#> She returned to Smith College after Christmas, having spent the first part of the academic year recovering. <#> She completed the second half of that year and returned in September for her final one. <#> Her final year thesis is interesting in the light of Sylvia 's own personality - it was a study of the literary doubles in Dostoyevsky. </p>
 <p> <#> After graduation she received a Fulbright scholarship to study in Cambridge, England. <#> It was here that she met Ted Hughes and married him after an acquaintance of only five months. <#> During this time she is happy in her letters home - they are filled with optimism and plans for the future. <#> It can be seen however that Plath 's feelings of strength are only evident in times of happiness when things were going well. <#> She could not carry her growth into the low points - always floundering when a bad patch hit. </p>
 <p> <#> After her graduation from Cambridge the couple moved to America where Sylvia took up a teaching post in Smith. <#> She quickly became frustrated with the job, however, as it left no time for the writing which was her main interest. <#> So it was no surprise that she left Smith at the end of a year. <#> She and Ted then devoted themselves to writing full time. </p>
 <p> <#> They moved back to England a year later where their first daughter Frieda was born in April 1960. <#> Both this and the demands of their writing posed too many problems in a small London flat so in 1961 they moved to Devon. <#> Although life here is painted in idyllic scenes at first by Sylvia, the marriage was in trouble by the following year and Ted Hughes finally moved away from his wife and (by now) two children in October 1962. <#> Sylvia now rejects the country life she has previously adored and wishes to find sanity in London, away from this <quote> ""cow life"" </quote> that she says is slowly suffocating her. <#> Her letters at the time are quite wild with plans, as if she was desperately trying to grasp something she could live for. </p>
 <p> <#> Because she could not sleep, a friend suggested that the write poems early in the morning. <#> She followed this advice and out of it came the ""October"" poems. <#> In these she rises above all the dependencies. <#> These are interesting to look at especially for their feminist assertiveness but also for the part they play in her own personal struggle. </p>
 <p> <#> Feminists point out that self sacrifice on the part of the female is expected by society. <#> It is taken for granted that it is right that women should sacrifice themselves to allow men to pursue their goals in life. <#> Therefore the destruction of the stereotypical woman is necessary for the rebirth of the self in a new recreated form. <#> This destruction and rebirth is away of overcoming patriarchy for the female. <#> This is a central concern of the feminist movement. <#> A destruction of the conventional social order, the male centred view of the world is necessary. </p>
 <p> <#> Sylvia Plath achieves this freedom from male domination, first in <it> The Bell Jar </it> by overcoming female stereotypical roles offered to her in the guise of various ""doubles"" for own personality and by doing so rejecting the niche that society has carved for her. <#> This theme is developed further in <it> Ariel </it> where recreation is achieved in powerful new female forms. </p>
 <p> <#> In <it> The Bell Jar </it> we find interesting constructions of Plath 's personality. <#> Esther Greenwood, the heroine, is Sylvia. <#> The other females in the book are all doubles for herself. <#> There is Doreen, the bad side of Esther, who is quite lose with men, drinks a lot and is not worried about hard work. <#> There is Betsy, the good girl representation, the homemaker personality of Esther. <#> She is sweet and innocent, only wanting a nice husband and adorable children from life. <#> The career choices are presented by Jay Cee, Esther 's managing editor on the magazine, and the Russian interpreter. <#> These doubles are not very attractive as women however, suggesting the disapproving eye society casts on women who choose traditionally male paths in life. <#> The voice of society comes through in Mrs Willard and Mrs Greenwood, both warning Esther of the importance of a girl remaining a virgin for her husband. </p>
 <p> <#> This opposition of virginal purity versus sexual permissiveness is a main preoccupation in the novel. <#> Esther wonders if she should remain pure for her husband or rush out to sleep with people just for the experience. <#> She is dismayed at a society which accepts double standards as norm - expecting female purity while turning a blind eye to male sexual activities outside of marriage. <#> It is represented in the way she builds up resentment towards her boyfriend Buddy after he had an affair with a waitress. <#> She is not annoyed so much by his unfaithfulness to her but by his double standards - constantly pretending to be a virgin and expecting her to remain one also. </p>
 <p> <#> Here her mother is the voice of society or Esther 's own common sense, pointing out the dangers of pregnancy. <#> She gives Esther an article entitled ""In Defence of Chastity,"", basically saying that even if a man is not a virgin at marriage he will expect his wife to be one. <#> Double standards have in this way been legitimised by society. </p>
 <p> <#> Esthers ' doubles represent different sides of the purity/impurity debate - the choices are Betsy/Doreen polarities. <#> Or should she turn pseudo-male like Jay Cee and the Russian interpreter? <#> In fact she rejects all of the alternatives presented in the guise of doubles and instead undergoes a sexual liberation. <#> Now she becomes the strong one in male/female relationships - previously deciding that she would ""let"" Constantin seduce her, she now meets Irwin and <quote> ""decides to seduce him."" </quote> <#> Similarly when Buddy Willard visits her at the hospital it is she who digs his car out of the snowdrift. </p>
 <p> <#> As the doubles are created at the beginning of <it> The Bell Jar, </it> they are transcended by the end. <it> <#> Ariel </it> goes on to achieve final and complete liberation from Plath 's conflicting doubles. <#> In her best poems she achieves this by freeing herself from male dependence. <#> They are written during her most difficult period but she exteriorises inner feelings to achieve a universalised expression of freedom and finds her true poetic voice, free at last of the masks. </p>
 <p> <#> The <it> Ariel </it> poems contain many that are depressing in themselves. <#> As it is published it ends on notes of despair and tragic finality - but this was not Plath 's wish. <#> Her intended arrangement began with the word ""love"" and ended with the word ""Spring"" - a movement through affirmation to destruction, then resurrection. <#> It is the resurrection which I am concerned with. <#> This should be, as Plath intended, the overall tone of the book. <#> The memorable poems are those in which the self emerges triumphant and victorious, particularly in ""Ariel"" itself, ""Lady Lazarus,"" ""Daddy"" and the ""Bee"" poems. </p>
 <p> <#> The best example we can take here is ""Lady Lazarus."" <#> The very name Lazarus conjures up images of rebirth. <#> The female here is destroyed, to achieve rebirth in a powerfully independent form - <quote> ""eating man like air."" </quote> <#> Her death takes place in the poem but it is the death necessary to precede resurrection. <#> Therefore it is not a suicidal death wish but a creative act of liberation. </p>
 <p> <#> The old self also dissolves in ""Ariel"" and ""Fever 103."" <#> Strains of the previous impurity question arise in ""Fever 103"" where the woman here is purged and purified. <#> Her old selves dissolve and she is pure and virginal at the end of the poem. <#> In ""Ariel"" the woman and the stallion fuse for form one and the old self is destroyed. <#> She is now the powerful one, she is the arrow, the shaping force of her own life. </p>
 <p> <#> ""Daddy"" is certainly an optimistic note in finally ridding herself of male domination. <#> She shakes free of her father's shadow, that Godlike presence in her life, which took its form first in her father 's expectations for her, then in his memory and finally materialised again in a human shape - that of Ted Hughes (she confided to her mother that Ted filled the huge hole that she felt in not having a father). <#> In the poem the husband and father are merged and overcome. <#> The fact that she seems to have shaken off her father mentally by cutting his memory off at the root, and physically in her separation from Hughes, is certainly an experience of rebirth for her. </p>
 <p> <#> One of her great achievements is that she does not deny her femininity, as some of her doubles have done, to achieve her liberation. <#> In overcoming male domination she creates new female forms through which to achieve expression, e.g. lioness, queen bee, Lady Lazarus. </p>
 <p> <#> Sylvia Plath died by her own hand in February 1963. <#> Finally the conflicts became too much for her, the masks she had employed as supports had failed her. <#> But, as I have pointed out, she achieved freedom and rebirth in life while she lived. <#> This is what we should remember her for, this is her legacy. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Heroin has once again exploded onto the streets of the capital. <#> TS O'Rourke talks to one addict about his love of drugs and the problems of kicking the habit. <#> We also report on a community that is fighting back and hear the opinions of <}> <-> on </-> <+> one </+> </}> youngster who has already seen the <}> <-> devasting </-> <+> devastating </+> </}> effects of drugs at age 13. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> JOHNNY (an alias) is in his late twenties and has been a heroin user for over eleven years. <#> His somewhat gaunt and menacing appearance is the result of some hard times. </p>
 <p> <#> I met Johnny in a central Dublin pub, where we talked for an hour over a quiet pint. <#> Explaining that he was just on his way up to Sean McDermott Street in order to buy some heroin, he said he would be back in a few minutes. <#> He left, anxious yet smiling. </p>
 <p> <#> Fifteen minutes later, Johnny returned having purchased two 'Q' (quarter-gram) bags of heroin from a young man on a bicycle, who was doing a roaring trade. <#> Showing me the two little parcels of heroin, Johnny explained: <quote> ""There 's loads of dealers in Sean McDermott Street, and if you know who to look for, you can get gear in a few minutes."" </quote> <#> He then proceeded to go into the gents ' toilets, from where he emerged a little later, having smoked one of the two deals. <#> The pub 's clientele were completely oblivious. </p>
 <p> <#> This is nothing new to Johnny, who was first tempted to inject heroin by friends in Dolphin 's Barn. <#> Less than a month later he was addicted, having used the drug on an almost-daily basis. </p>
 <p> <#> He continues to use heroin because of what it does for him. <#> <quote> ""You get an amazing feeling of well-being, and you don't have any worries. <#> Most other drugs have an uplifting effect - this is more of a mellow feeling. <#> Everything feels great and you don't care about anything."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> As you might have guessed, Johnny has paid for his addiction. <#> Convicted four times, he has spent time in Dublin 's Mountjoy Prison. <#> <quote> ""I 've been convicted of robbery with violence and selling drugs to get money."" </quote> <#> A heroin habit is extremely expensive, and Johnny got his money for drugs <quote> ""basically by breaking into houses, stealing videos, robbing garages, mugging people and armed robbery."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> <quote> ""I didn't care where the money came from."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Speaking of his time spent in Mountjoy, he said: <quote> ""Mountjoy is a dump - you wouldn't put a pig in the place. <#> You 're only allowed out for six hours during the day - it 's not a nice place to be."" </quote> <#> However, drugs are readily available, and Johnny admits that they help you to do your time. <#> Apparently you can get anything you want in Mountjoy. <#> <quote> ""There are various ways of smuggling drugs into Mountjoy - the security there is very lax - and a lot of the screws turn a blind eye to it."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Despite widespread knowledge that the HIV virus can be transmitted through sharing syringes, addicts in Mountjoy continue to share their 'works' with one another, with up to 30 people using one syringe. <#> <quote> ""Mainly it 's injected by prisoners in the toilets or in the recreation area - you 'd see up to ten people in a cubicle using the one syringe. <#> If you 're in the grips of a drug, you don't care what way it comes."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> As prisoners are only subjected to a strip search - and not a cavity search - smuggling drugs in is not a problem. <#> For many prisoners, repeated court appearances can be lucrative, as friends or relatives pass heroin packages to them, which they can either use or sell once they return to the prison. </p>
 <p> <#> The best way to hide heroin is in your mouth, according to Johnny. <#> <quote> ""The Garda&/i can't force you to open your mouth - they can only search your clothes - so it 's easy. <#> I 've been stopped a few times and searched by the police with heroin in my mouth."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> The importation of heroin, although illegal, continues daily. <#> Using couriers, the drug bosses import at least 20 to 30 ounces a week. <#> Couriers are usually paid in drugs. <#> <quote> ""There 's great profit to be made - they bring in 60 per cent pure heroin, but by the time it gets onto the streets it 's only about 20 per cent pure."" </quote> <#> Heroin is regularly cut with such innocuous substances as quinine or milk sugar, decreasing the purity and increasing the profit margin. </p>
 <p> <#> Recently, users have taken to smoking the drug (<quote> ""chasing the dragon"" </quote> ) in an attempt to avoid contracting the HIV virus through intravenous use. </p>
 <p> <#> According to many sources, the purity of the drug has almost doubled recently, and the price has also dropped. <#> This, Johnny believes, is to lure back users by giving them a better hit while smoking it. <#> Unfortunately, this has also led to an increased chance of accidental overdose for those unused to such pure heroin. </p>
 <p> <#> As we were taking the accompanying photographs, a Garda sergeant walked right past, apparently oblivious to the presence of the drugs. <#> Johnny said: <quote> ""Most people would be very surprised at how easily available heroin is in Dublin."" </quote> <#> Commenting on the success rate of the Garda&/i, Johnny said: <quote> ""They are fighting a losing battle. <#> They only seize about 2 per cent of the total amount imported, and there 's too much money involved for the drugs bosses to give it up."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Johnny is only one of over 5000 reported heroin addicts in Ireland. <#> The Aruppe Society - who do work with homeless young people - estimates these addicts are responsible for over two-thirds of Ireland 's crime. </p>

 <h> <bold> <it> <#> 3 The Syntax of Space </it> </h>
 <h> <#> 3.1 Spatial Organization - Nominal Loci and Verb Directionality </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In so far as the production and recognition of visual patterns is dependent on spatial distinctions, it is of course trivially true that spatial organization constitutes one dimension of sign language, just as it is true that speech can be described in acoustic terms. <#> The description of sign in terms of its use of space can thus proceed on what we might term the 'phonetic' level. <#> But it is also the case that the spatial dimension can lay claim to significance on the syntactic level of explanation also - as indeed on the level of discourse, though this will not be our primary concern here. <#> In this chapter I will attempt to provide a framework within which the analysis of 'spatial syntax' in HPSG terms might proceed. <#> To begin with, I will look at the association of nominals with locations in signing space; following this I will explore the way in which certain verbs exploit this mechanism of 'spatial indexing'. </p>
 <p> <#> Referring nominals in ASL are frequently associated with particular points, usually called <it> loci, </it> in signing space (Lillo-Martin and Klima 1990, Meier 1990, van Hoek 1992). <#> The effect of this assignment of location is analogous to the assignment of abstract indices that is generally assumed in syntactic, and indeed discourse-oriented, accounts of reference and coreference: a locus is uniquely associated with the referent of the nominal, and this association may be exploited to refer anaphorically to the referent at any point in the succeeding discourse. <#> In principle, there is no limit on the number of loci that may be established. <#> A locus can be assigned to a referent in one of a number of ways (Lillo-Martin 1986). <#> If the referent is an entity physically present, then that entity's actual location will, in general, function as its locus. <sp> 1 </sp> <#> An entity not present in the signing situation may acquire a locus through being signed in a particular, arbitrary position on its first appearance in the discourse, or it may be signed in neutral space and then explicitly assigned a locus through pointing. <#> Alternatively, the signer may gaze at the locus while making the relevant sign. </p>
 <p> <#> Once established, a locus can be exploited referentially in a number of ways. <#> Most obvious, perhaps, is the case of reported conversation; here, the signer commonly adopts the role of each of the participants in the reported conversation in turn. <#> The role being played at a given moment is indicated by body orientation and gaze, and these parameters are determined by the loci assigned to the (absent) speaker and addressee. <sp> 2 </sp> <#> Loci are also exploited in a way that is apparently analogous to pronominal reference in spoken language: this is achieved by pointing to the appropriate locus with the index finger. <#> Meier (1990) points out that while it is clear that ASL has gestures which, in certain contexts, are best rendered in spoken languages as personal pronouns, it does not follow <it> necessarily </it> that these are in fact pronouns in the same sense, since the use of pointing to indicate reference in discourse is nearly universal in human communication but is not generally considered to be a linguistic phenomenon. <#> However, Meier goes on to adduce evidence in support of the view that the pointing employed in ASL is linguistic in nature; among his arguments are the fact that deictic point-gestures are interspersed with unambiguously linguistic signs, and the fact that similar syntactic constraints apply to their distribution as to that of other signs. <#> Finally, spatial loci also play an important role in designating the participants in the relation introduced by certain kinds of verbs, and in specifying their role in the relation. <#> In this chapter I will be concerned with capturing the pronominal and verbal uses of space in ASL. </p>
 <h> <it> <#> 3.1.1 The ASL Pronominal System and Referential Indexing </it> </h>
 <p> <#> One argument mitigating against the claim that ASL pointing signs are pronominal is that, since there is in principle no limit to the number of loci that may be established in signing-space, there must also be no limit to the number of pronouns that must be present in the lexicon. <#> If we accept this, then we must accept that there is indeed a substantial qualitative difference between the pronominal system of ASL and that of any spoken language, since there is no known spoken language that has an open-ended inventory of pronouns. <#> Now, it is certainly true that, if we accept ASL points as pronouns, we must also accept that each entity in a given discourse may receive a uniquely assigned pronominal form. <#> The English pronominal system must be considered sadly impoverished by comparison; any number of individual male referents in a discourse, for example, must be content to share a single <it> he </it> among themselves. <#> GB theory and HPSG share a belief, however, that this degenerate paradigm is the surface manifestation of an underlying abstract, but psychologically real system of reference-tracking that involves abstract entities called <it> indices.</it>  <#> These, like spatial loci in ASL, are uniquely assigned to referents, and must hence be assumed to be infinite in number, since an infinite number of distinct referents may in principle be referred to in a given discourse. <#> In HPSG, as we have seen, it is assumed that part of the informational composition of indices are the parameters alluded to above, namely, person, number and gender (for English, at least). <#> For Pollard and Sag (1994), these features serve simply to help distinguish indices from one another:
 <quote> <#> Indices bear formal agreement features, in much the same way that pushpins employed by military strategists to represent army divisions might come in different colors to represent different countries.  (p.72) </quote>
 <#> Hence, the fact that there is a limited variety of pronouns in spoken languages is a consequence of the limitations imposed by the taxonomy of pronominal forms; pronominal agreement systems are multidimensional, but the set of possible classifications along each descriptive axis is nonetheless discrete and finite. <#> The visual modality of a sign language, on the other hand, permits an alternative system of formally marking distinctions among referents; instead of labelling indices with features corresponding to qualities inherent in the referents to which they are anchored, <sp> 3 </sp> they can be associated with physical locations, arbitrarily assigned or actual. <#> It happens to be a property of such a system that, like color-coding, it allows distinctions along a continuum; there is therefore potentially an infinitude of overt distinctions corresponding to the theoretical infinitude of indices. <#> Also like colour-coding of course, the upper bound on the number of distinctions that can in practice be made is determined by the limits on the precision with which humans can distinguish between adjacent points on a continuum. </p>
 <p> <#> The important point here is that there is in principle no conflict between the facts of ASL and the understanding of reference assumed in GB or HPSG. <#> Each of these theories does in fact posit unique indices for each referent in a given discourse; the formal features of spoken language merely fail to reflect this. <#> It is a consequence of the modality of ASL (and other sign languages) that they have the means to reflect overtly the one-to-one nature of index-referent mapping. </p>
 <p> <#> We saw in the previous chapter how HPSG deals with indices in relation to nominals: they are treated as being inherent to particular lexical nominals. <#> Thus, <it> book </it> is specified in the lexicon as introducing an index with the agreement features 3rd, singular, neuter. <#> There are only as many pronouns in the HPSG lexicon as there are morphological distinctions between pronominal forms according to agreement features; <quote> 'doubling-up' </quote> of pronominal function in a single form is easily captured thanks to the partial nature of information supplied by lexical feature structures. <#> Thus, English <it> you </it> is unspecified for number and gender; the former may be supplied by the morphology of a verb subcategorizing it as a subject, the latter by virtue of coindexation, hence unification, with a nominal introducing a gender-specific index. <#> However, if we adopt this account of pronouns for ASL, then we will indeed have to posit an infinitude of lexical pronouns, each introducing a distinct index, each one specified for a different morphology - i.e., a different locus. <#> Standard HPSG thus does not appear to provide a satisfactory account of the pronominal system of ASL. </p>
 <h>  <it> <#> 3.1.2  Directional verbs and the HPSG account of verb agreement </it> </h>
 <p> <#> A further difficulty is presented by the phenomenon of directional verbs. <#> ASL verbs can be broadly divided into two classes: <it> non-directional </it> and <it> directional. </it>  <#> Directional verbs in turn come in two varieties, <it> uni-directional </it> and <it> bi-directional. </it> <#> Directional verbs, as the designation suggests, typically involve a specific movement from one locus towards another. <#> In the case of uni-directional verbs, this movement often originates at a particular (invariant) point on the signer 's body and moves towards the locus assigned to the entity filling the patient role <sp> 4 </sp> in the semantic relation described by the verb. <#> Thus, TELL, for instance, begins with a handshape at the signer 's chin and moves towards the appropriate object locus. <#> Both the origin and the target of movement of bi-directional verbs are dictated by the roles they assign: the agent 's locus is the starting point and, again, the patient 's locus is the movement 's end-point; GIVE is such a verb. <#> Plain verbs are those whose form is not affected by role-allocation, such as UNDERSTAND. <#> There is a consensus among researchers into ASL as to how these verbal phenomena are best treated: one aspect of the form of a directional verb in ASL - its movement - is dependent on its arguments; since there is a clear analogy between such a dependency and the verb agreement phenomena which are pervasive in spoken languages, it is considered appropriate to analyze them in the same terms. <#> Thus, directional verbs are often referred to as <it> inflecting </it> and non-directional verbs as <it> plain </it> verbs. </p>
 <p> <#> In GB theory, verb agreement is a phenomenon arising out of movement to the verbal node of an autonomous, structurally represented segment (INFL, or AGR) comprising <quote> 'a bundle of features' </quote> (to use the standard locution) - or, possibly, movement of the verb to the node containing the agreement features. <#> In either case, agreement is construed as a morphological mechanism that is located in the grammar, and agreement features exist independently of particular verbs. <#> In HPSG, by contrast, the standard assumption is that verb agreement is best dealt with in the lexicon. <#> Agreement features are not encoded directly on verbs, however; rather, it is assumed that agreement is a direct consequence of argument selection. <#> Since the elements of a head 's valence lists are <it> synsem </it> objects, it follows that verbs are capable of selecting the INDEX feature of their NP arguments. <#> An English third-singular verb is thus one that selects a subject NP whose INDEX has the features [PERS <it> 3rd </it>] and [NUM <it> sing </it>]. <#> The inflectional paradigm is captured by lexical rules specifying that particular phonological functions on the base form are constrained to accompany particular argument selections; hence, in English there is a <it> 3rd-singular </it> lexical rule that derives, from a verbal base form, a verb that has 3rd-singular morphology and the index of whose subject has 3-rd singular agreement features.  </p>
 <p> <#> We have observed that, if we adhere to standard HPSG assumptions, we must posit the existence in the ASL lexicon of an infinitude of pronominal forms. <#> Given the HPSG understanding of the nature of verb agreement, there is an even more acute problem in the case of verbs. <#> Just as there is theoretically an infinity of pronominal forms, so we must assume that the inflectional paradigm for each directional verb is open-ended; and, given the foregoing assumptions, we must also assume that each form is lexically represented. <#> Clearly, while the number of inflectional forms available for uni-directional verbs is equal to the number of available indices, the number of forms of bi-directional verbs approaches the square of this figure. <#> Lexical rules cannot simplify matters here; since each distinct inflectional form requires a distinct lexical rule to derive it, the number of lexical rules needed will be equal to the number of verbal forms. </p>

 <h> <#> Coliform mastitis a major killer </h>
 <p> <#> THE BOVINE mortality survey carried out by the Veterinary Science Division identified coliform mastitis, or acute environmental mastitis, as one of the major killers of adult dairy and suckler cows in Northern Ireland. </p>
 <p> <#> Unlike ordinary mastitis, the udder infection in the coliform version has been shown to be the result of exposure to bacteria that survive and, in the right conditions, multiply within the cow 's environment. </p>
 <p> <#> It is most common during the winter months when cattle are housed, particularly from December to March, and often in milking herds which practice teat dipping and dry cow therapy. </p>
 <p> <#> The affect herds are usually well-managed, the husbandry is good and the cows are mainly housed in cubicles and fed silage. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Typically, the condition occurs in freshly-calved cows in their fourth or fifth lactation. <#> It is uncommon in calved heifers. </p>
 <p> <#> The bacteria involved are mostly the same as those excreted in cow faeces and <it> E. coli </it> are the most commonly isolated species - hence the general term coliform mastitis. <#> Because these bacteria produce toxins, the affected animal is often suddenly very ill, after being quite normal at the last milking or feeding time. </p>
 <p> <#> The cow will be very depressed, sometimes down and unable to rise with a low body temperature - this can be confused with milk fever. <#> There will be swelling <}> <-> or </-> <+> of </+> </}> one <}> <-> of </-> <+> or </+> </}> more of the mammary quarters with a watery mastitis. </p>
 <p> <#> The overall survival rate is usually only 50 per cent and urgent attention will be required from a veterinary surgeon who will use aggressive therapy, often including intravenous fluids, to save the life of the cow. </p>
 <p> <#> Quarter sampling, for culture and drug sensitivity at a laboratory, will indicate the best form of antibiotic treatment for use in future cases. </p>
 <p> <#> Recent evidence also suggests that stripping out of the infected quarter, every two or three hours, to remove the <it> E. coli </it> and its toxin, is a helpful procedure. <#> Ironically, the infected quarter, although lost to the present lactation, will return to almost full production in the next lactation, provided the cow survives. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> CONTROL MEASURES </bold> </h>
 <p> <it> <#> Calving boxes: </it> Obviously, it is important to reduce the level of faecal contamination in the cow 's immediate environment. </p>
 <p> <#> Because freshly-calved cows have a depressed immune system, they are known to be more susceptible to coliform mastitis. </p>
 <p> <#> Consequently, it is essential to clean out calving boxes at regular intervals, certainly at least two-three times during the winter months and particularly after a coliform mastitis has occurred, as this indicates that the environment is heavily contaminated with <it> E. coli </it> </p>
 <p> <#> <it> Cubicles: </it> It is equally important to keep the <}> <-> the </-> <+> ? </+> </}> of the cow 's environment as clean as possible. </p>
 <p> <#> Scrape out the backs of cubicles and passageways at least twice a day and bed down the cubicles at lease three times a week with sufficient material to make the cows use them. </p>
 <p> <#> Unfortunately, the bacteria can multiply in dirty, damp bedding, particularly if it is the type of material that could act as a compost, for example, materials such as sawdust, mushroom compost, chopped paper and peat. <#> These will require more attention than biologically inactive materials such as crushed limestone, sand and rubber mats. </p>
 <p> <#> However, all of these are useless if they are contaminated and are continually damp because the ventilation within the cubicle house is inadequate. <#> Dry bedding in a well-ventilated house with slotted roofs and Yorkshire cladding will inhibit the multiplication of <it> E. coli. </it> </p>
 <p> <it> <#> Before and after milking: </it> In the parlour, make sure that the cow 's teats are cleaned and dried before milking. </p>
 <p> <#> Drying is particularly important, as <}> <-> washinh </-> <+> washing </+> </}> without it just produces a heavily contaminated drip at the end of each teat. </p>
 <p> <#> Also, make sure that the milking machine is cleaned adequately after each milking with a temperature that exceeds 85Deg C to ensure the destruction of coliform bacteria. </p>
 <p> <#> High Total Bacterial Counts (TBCs) are a sure sign that one, or all, of these tasks are not being done properly. </p>
 <p> <#> Finally, infection can also take place immediately after milking, particularly when the teat canal is still open and the cow leaves the parlour to lie in a dirty cubicle. </p>
 <p> <#> Closure of this canal takes 20-30 minutes and if the cow can be kept on her feet for this period, say at the silo face because she is hungry, then disease incidence will fall. </p>
 <p> <#> Reducing the concentrate levels in the parlour and closing the cows out of the silo for one-two hours before milking will have the desired effect. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> CONCLUSIONS: </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> 1. Coliform mastitis is caused by faecal organisms. </p>
 <p> <#> 2. The condition is life-threatening, so seek immediate veterinary help. </p>
 <p> <#> 3. Control measures should be aimed at reducing the environmental levels of <it> E. coli. </it> </p>
 <p> <#> 4. Keep cows on their feet after milking. </p>

IrishEnglish,can,Prismatic glass (or plastic) controls transmitted light by refraction and can be used to redirect or to exclude sunlight,dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,<W2B-038$A>,"
 <h> <#> GETTING NATURAL LIGHT INTO BUILDINGS </h>
 <h> <#> ANN MCNICHOLL </h>
 <p> <#> It is difficult to overestimate the significance of daylight, and of sunlight, in the character of a building and in the lives of the people who use it. <#> There are, of course, some building types, such as theatres or nightclubs, where being cut off from the world outside is an essential part of the experience. <#> In others, shops or museums for example, daylight may be excluded from large areas of the building so as to give full play to display lighting. <#> But most interiors which are to be occupied by people (as opposed to goods or machinery) need plenty of light and, with global warming and 'Sick Building Syndrome' on our minds, natural light and ventilation have once again become critical determinants in the form our buildings take. </p>
 <p> <#> Daylight is variable and unpredictable. <#> It is these characteristics which account for peoples liking for it and for the sparkle that it brings to the interior of a building but which also make it challenging to work with. <#> We want sunshine and daylight, but we don't like glare, downdrafts, loss of privacy, ultra-violet damage or severe temperature swings. <#> Too much glazing, the wrong kind of glazing, or glazing in the wrong place may produce heat losses or gains which have to be countered by artificial heating or cooling. <#> So, good daylight design must form part of a considered architectural strategy for the building as a whole, controlling and exploiting the available light, maximising its advantages and minimising its disadvantages. <#> Most of the critical decisions are made during the early design stages. </p>
 <p> <#> The design possibilities of the 'window' are, of course, extremely rich. <#> Whether treated as a simple hole in the wall or as a complete three-dimensional element it makes a fundamental contribution to the quality of interior spaces and the external appearance of the building. <#> The way in which it frames a view, captures light, or channels warmth, sound and air, helps determine the character of any room - whether it is intended to be simply humane and comfortable, visually exciting, or solemn, with symbolic and spiritual impact. </p>
 <p> <#> The following paragraphs review some new and traditional daylighting devices and products which can be used to control daylight and sunlight, and to moderate the conflict between good daylighting and a good thermal environment which glazing so often entails. <#> Lightwells, roof monitors and clerestory windows are well established devices for getting light deep into buildings. <#> The atrium can be seen as an elaborated and inhabited lightwell, lightshelves and coated or prismatic glasses as sophisticated shades and blinds, while the concept of the lightpipe or transparent insulation is relatively new. <#> Shading devices per se are not described, but these are as important, and selection of the appropriate type is particularly dependent on local climatic conditions. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Rooflights </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Because the sky is generally brighter at its zenith than near the horizon, a horizontal rooflight is proportionally three times more effective as a source of daylight than a vertical window - and it casts its light over a space in a more uniform way. <#> Direct sunlight can be diffused by translucent glazing and glare controlled by baffles. <#> Very beautiful effects can be created by fitting angled reflectors below the rooflight or locating one beside a wall, so that ceilings or walls are washed with light. </p>
 <p> <#> A disadvantage of the horizontal rooflight, compared to a vertical window, is that it collects more light and heat in summer than in winter - usually the opposite of what is desired. <#> For this reason vertical or near-vertical rooflights, clerestories, sawtooth or roof monitors are often preferred for lighting single-storey deep spaces. <#> They can be oriented North, South, East or West as necessary and screened with conventional shades. <#> The duration and quality of light can be enhanced by placing light-catching scoops on the roof outside the glazing, and the distribution of reflected light into the space below controlled by rooflight geometry. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Lightshelves and Louvres </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The lightshelf, a flat or curved element placed at the window opening above eye level, redirects incoming light onto the ceiling and simultaneously provides shading for the area of the room close to the window. <#> The underside of the shelf can also redirect light from a high-reflectance exterior ground surface onto the floor inside the room. <#> Lightshelves are most efficient when they are external, cause minimal obstruction to the window area, have specular reflective surfaces, and are combined with a ceiling of high reflectance. <#> Interior shelves have been found to be less useful - they obstruct daylight entering the room while providing little compensating benefit. <#> The shading control functions of a fixed lightshelf are least effective for low-angle sunlight, and in northern Europe should generally be considered only if glare is a severe problem, or window size is restricted and internal surfaces (other than ceilings) must be of low reflectance. </p>
 <p> <#> Adjustable louvres with a specular finish on the upper surfaces of their blades are more responsive than lightshelves and, if completely retractable, need cause no obstruction of daylight on overcast days. <#> Sophisticated fixed-louvre systems, incorporating lenses and mirrored faces, are now available. <#> These are custom-made for the particular latitude and facade orientations and can combine shading with redirection of both direct and diffuse light deeper into the building. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Lightpipes and Lightducts </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> These are among the more mechanically complex daylighting devices. <#> Sunlight is collected by heliostats (mirrors controlled by a tracking device), concentrated by means of mirrors or lenses, then directed to the core of the building through shafts or along acrylic rods or fibreoptic cables. <#> Because they depend on direct sunlight, and are relatively expensive to install, they are cost-effective only in climates where blue skies and clean air can be guaranteed for much <}> <-> or </-> <+> of </+> </}> the year. <#> (Energy-efficient back-up lamps can be fixed at the head of the shaft to substitute for sunlight during infrequent overcase conditions.) <#> The recent development of thermo-hydraulic tracking systems powered by solar cells should improve economic viability. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Atria </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The daylight performance of an atrium is complex. <#> Its proportions determine the amount of direct daylight reaching the floor - wide, shallow <}> <-> . </-> <+> , </+> </}> square atria perform better in this respect than do deep, narrow, rectangular ones. <#> The design of the atrium walls significantly affects the distribution of light once it has entered the atrium. <#> Dark finishes reduce internal reflectance and the deeper the atrium the more important this becomes. <#> Windows in the atrium wall reduce reflectance also - the upper walls are the most critical in reflecting incoming light down into the atrium, so it is best to limit windows in this area. </p>
 <p> <#> This arrangement corresponds with the requirements of rooms facing into the atrium - rooms at the upper levels get <}> <-> </-> </}> of light but need protection from glare, while those at the base need to maximise the amount of light they receive. <#> Design strategies include making rooms near the base lower, increasing their floor to ceiling heights, or stepping up the upper floors in successive steps so that all rooms have some view of the sky. <#> (The same principles will apply to a building facade on a narrow street.) <#> The closer the room is to the bottom of the atrium the greater its dependence on light opened from atrium walls and floor. <#> Reflectors may be fixed on the windows of lower rooms to redirect more of the zenithal onto their ceilings, but this is generally cost-effective only when other considerations determine that the reflectances of atrium walls and floors must be low. <#> And while rooms further from the atrium roof may have lower light levels, they may have better light quality in terms of uniform distribution and absence of glare. </p>
 <p> <#> Putting any glass roof over an open court will reduce daylight levels in the court by at least 20 <*> per cent sign </*>, and sometimes by 50 <*> per cent sign </*> or more. <#> So the structure of an atrium roof should minimise obstructions to the glazing area and its connections to the building should be such that light is allowed to wash the atrium walls. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Transparent Insulation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Transparent Insulation Materials (TIM),. which tend to be translucent rather than truly transparent, were initially developed primarily as insulation for Trombe wall assemblies. <#> But because they transmit light, they can also function as a glazing material. <#> There are several categories of TIM, using different materials and a variety of forms - foamed, capillary, honeycomb, fibre and gel. <#> Most need protection on one or both sides by glass or plastic sheets. <#> Light transmission of TIM ranges from 45 <*> per cent sign </*> to 80 <*> per cent sign </*>, with a reduction of approximately 8 <*> per cent sign </*> for each sheet of protective glass used. <#> Insulation values are very much better than for glass. <#> For example, 98mm hexagonal honeycomb polyamid TIM has a light transmission factor of 61 <*> per cent sign </*> combined with an insulation value five times that of a double glazed window. <#> TIM can be incorporated into purpose-made window assemblies by most window manufacturers. <#> Costs tend to be approximately three times those of conventional double-glazed windows. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Glazing Materials </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> A conventional window, single-glazed with clear float glass may transmit approximately 85 <*> per cent sign </*> of the light that falls upon it. <#> Double or triple glazing will reduce light transmission to 70 <*> per cent sign </*> and 60 <*> per cent sign </*> respectively. <#> Where lighting requirements demand larger areas of glass than would be thermally satisfactory, specially treated glass can be used to control heat losses or gains. </p>
 <p> <#> The early tinted glasses reduced solar heat gain to some degree but also cut down daylight transmission and distorted the colour of the landscape outside. <#> Heat absorbing glasses do not reduce daylight transmission to quite the same degree, but reduce heat gain by only 10 <*> per cent sign </*> because a large percentage of the heat absorbed is re-radiated into the interior. <#> Reflective glass blocks solar radiation effectively (reflectances up to 50 <*> per cent sign </*> are available) but, like tinted glass, it blocks light as well as heat, and it continues to do so in winter when heat gain and daylight may be beneficial. <#> Selective 'low-e' double glazing. <#> with a resistance to heat loss equivalent to that of triple glazing, has a light transmission factor of approximately 80 <*> per cent sign </*>. </p>
 <p> <#> Current developments include the responsive chromogenic glasses. <#> Electrochromic glass changes its optical absorption properties and becomes dark or cloudy in response to an externally applied electric field. <#> The opacity disappears when the field is reversed. <#> It can be readily integrated into a responsive building climate control system. <#> Thermochromic glass switches between a heat-transmitting and a heat-reflecting state at selected temperature thresholds and photochromic glass darkens and lightens in response to changes in light intensity. <#> At <}> <-> presen,t </-> <+> present, </+> </}> material costs of all three are high and durability uncertain but improving. </p>
 <p> <#> Glass to which a holographic film has been applied does not block radiation but diffracts it. <#> The film can be designed to direct incoming sunlight on to a reflective surface, such as the ceiling, or deep into a room. <#> It can be designed also to reflect sunlight coming from pre-defined angles (high-angle sun on South facades, or low-angle sun on East and West facades, for example). <#> Up to four images containing different 'instructions' can be combined in one layer. <#> A view out through the window is retained but from some viewing angles there is a rainbow effect. <#> Its performance for diffused light is poor, but research is continuing. <#> Costs are not high but at the moment holographic film is not available in the sizes needed for the building industry. </p>
 <p> <#> Prismatic glass (or plastic) controls transmitted light by refraction and can be used to redirect or to exclude sunlight. <#> The direction of incoming daylight is changed as it passes through an array of triangular wedges whose geometry can be designed for particular conditions and orientations. <#> In several recent applications it has been used to reduce glare. <#> Prismatic glass is translucent rather than transparent, so cannot be used where a view outdoors is required. <#> Normally a prismatic refracting panel consists of two sheets with their prismatic faces facing each other to protect them form dust accumulation. <#> They can also be used within double-glazed units. <#> While the sheets themselves are inexpensive, the overall construction cost is higher than for conventional glazing. <#> Prismatic assemblies, including sophisticated systems incorporating silvered wedge-faces and several panel types, are increasingly available. </p>

 <p> <#> THE PROSPECTIVE political partners are just now finalising their programme for what they describe as a <it> Government for Renewal. </it> <#> If they can indeed provide a sense of renewal after the appalling conflicts of the last few weeks, then their new administration will be widely welcomed. </p>
 <p> <#> But they do have a major task ahead. <#> The current negotiations are private, but we must assume that public sector pay is one of the key problems to be sorted out. <#> If this issue is not tackled head on, then this incoming Government will fail to deliver the economic and social benefits which are the essential dynamo for growth. </p>
 <p> <#> The entire thrust of recent government policy has been to tax wage earners highly, to penalise industry and to extract the very maximum taxation on all economic activity. <#> This extra money has been expropriated from the public by the Revenue Commissioners with ruthless efficiency. <#> That has been the real policy of the outgoing government and the Revenue Commissioners have carried out that policy dutifully. <#> That is their job. </p>
 <p> <#> The money collected has been transferred from individual wage earners in the private sector directly into the pockets of those working in the public sector. <#> Thus, since 1987 wages in the public sector have risen by 70 <*> per cent sign </*> , compared with a 44 <*> per cent sign </*> increase for everyone else. </p>
 <p> <#> Not only has that policy been unfair, it has had the effect of seriously slowing down, if not strangling, firms which otherwise would have been able to offer more employment. <#> That policy has to stop, it has to be reversed. </p>
 <p> <#> The outgoing Government constantly told us how good they were, but there was a large element of bluff in all their insistent assurances. <#> In fact, the last Government was held to ransom by the public sector. <#> The price was paid dearly by the unemployed and by those tens of thousands of bright young people who had to emigrate. <#> The funds which should have generated jobs were swept away into the public purse. <#> That was the true record of the last Government. </p>
 <p> <#> It was a policy which denied hundreds of thousands of our young people a right to live their lives, and to develop their careers here. <#> Those educated young people who are working in London, Birmingham, Paris and Berlin and as illegals in the United States have been cheated also of their Irish inheritance. <#> That policy can be changed, it must be changed. </p>
 <p> <#> The incoming Government must reduce taxes for lower paid workers. <#> That is the only way in which their standard of living can increase. <#> The new administration must insist on striking a more equitable balance between the public and the private sectors. </p>
 <p> <#> We believe that the Democratic Left, Fine Gael and the Labour Party will receive a strong, positive response if, together as a united front, they adopt a policy of social reform, based on equality and justice. </p>
 <p> <#> The Democratic Left is a Party with concise and practical ideas on the creation and the distribution of wealth and we do not believe that they are in any way the Party of extremists, as they are sometimes portrayed. </p>
 <p> <#> Similarly, once the Labour Party abandon their excessive use of shallow, public relations hyperbole and empty moral platitudes, they will gain greatly in public respect and will be in a better position to implement policies of genuine reform. <#> Fine Gael should also be able to work well with these partners because, despite its traditional middle class support, it has always been inspired by popular radicalism which was epitomised over a generation ago by Declan Costello 's <it> Just Society </it> document. <#> For all these reasons we believe that the partners share a common idealism and zeal for reform. </p>
 <p> <#> The new partners certainly have the potential and they have the will. <#> All they require is a genuine unity of purpose, a spirit of tolerance and a determination to be truly loyal to each other, at least for their term in office. <#> It can be done. <#> In the interests of the country it must be done. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> CD-ROMÉ The REVOLUTION is just beginning </bold> <h>
 <h> <#> by Lynn Boyd </h>
 <p> <#> A CD-ROM (compact disk read only memory) looks like a standard audio CD but instead of music holds information suitable for computer use. </p>
 <p> <#> The main advantage of such a disk is that is capable of holding a much greater amount of information than the standard floppy disk. </p>
 <p> <#> One CD-ROM can hold the equivalent of 500 3.5 inch floppy disks, 200,000 pages of text, or 72 minutes of video play. </p>
 <p> <#> Such disks can be reproduced very cheaply. <#> Once you have your information encoded on CD-ROM, you can simply take your mastercopy CD to a company which will replicate it for about <*> pound sign </*> 1 per copy for large print-runs. </p>
 <p> <#> Once written, the information on CD-ROM cannot be changed. <#> This makes it excellent for storing large amounts of archival material such as medical records, examination papers for universities and examining boards, or for storing inspection records for industry. </p>
 <p> <#> CD-ROM is the standard format for music but it is also now becoming the standard format for other areas such as the ubiquitous computer game. </p>
 <p> <#> This is because the disk can hold so much information, is cheap to produce and has a longer shelf-life than the equivalent information stored on vinyl. </p>
 <p> <#> Many libraries, including those at Queen 's University, have CD-ROM facilities available, as do a growing number of secondary schools. </p>
 <p> <#> It can be used for multi-media publishing, with interactive programmes using sound, graphics and digitised video animations. </p>
 <p> <#> The information is constructed in such a way as to allow users to carry out text searches easily, requesting further information. </p>
 <p> <#> So how widespread have the uses of this technological innovation become? <#> In 1992 there were some between six and seven million drives in use. </p>
 <p> <#> This year the price has fallen dramatically, so that the average cost of a DC-ROM drive to be used in conjunction with a PC is now around <*> pound sign </*> 200. </p>
 <p> <#> CD-I (Compact Disk-Interactive) is already widely used. <#> The system from which it operates looks like a CD player and hooks up to a TV like a VCR. </p>
 <p> <#> As well as playing normal audio CDs, interactive multimedia CD-I offers high quality images, hi-fi sound and complete interactivity. </p>
 <p> <#> This means children can watch a cartoon, recolour its character and even change the soundtrack and play back their own version. </p>
 <p> <#> The CD-I device will soon become a means of receiving multimedia information and other services, such as interactive games, access to electronic databases, and even home shopping. </p>
 <p> <#> In the foreseeable future you should be able to rent a video without visiting a video rental shop you 'll simply dial it up. </p>
 <p> <#> You will be able to tune into almost any sports event being played anywhere in the world, perhaps even choosing the camera angle and controlling your own instant replays. </p>
 <p> <#> You could have instant success to almost any home shopping catalogue (complete with mini commercials and product demonstrations). </p>
 <p> <#> You might also wish to access information in libraries around the world or from financial services such as banking, investing or insurance. </p>
 <p> <#> CD-ROM is also beginning to play an important role in the world of photography. <#> It is now possible to take slides to a commercial processor, and, for an extra fee, have them put on CD-ROM. </p>
 <p> <#> With the addition of a small box to your TV or home PC you could then access them on screen. <#> It is also possible to produce photos from CD, but the technology is not widely available. </p>
 <p> <#> A more immediately accessible use of CD-ROM can be identified for creative professional such as graphic designers. </p>
 <p> <#> They can now store photographs on disk, which has obvious implications for saving storage space, particularly as this form of archiving is less prone to deterioration than storing film. </p>
 <p> <#> With the arrival of CD recorders at about the same price as an average office photo-copier, it is possible to have a machine that produces CD-ROMs containing thousands of pages of information relevant to your own organisation. </p>
 <p> <#> As the price of CD-ROM drives continues to fall, the day is not far off when every office will have one. <#> This will enable large volumes of reference and archival material to be accessed by other CD-ROM users. </p>
 <p> <#> Among local companies which are currently using CD-ROMs is Textflow Services of Belfast, which is currently archiving QUB examination papers and encoding a publishing firm 's journals into CD-ROM. </p>
 <p> <#> Dr Paul Mackey of Textflow said: <quote> ""If all journals were encoded onto disk in this way, institutions such as libraries could then buy the journal on disk at the end of each year, thereby saving an enormous amount of library space."" </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> The full technological capabilities of CD-ROM are just beginning to emerge. </p>
 <p> <#> Already CD-ROMs are being used to teach novice computer users the fundamentals of computer hardware and software, with the aid of graphics and animation. </p>

 <p> <#> I always prefer simple dishes to fussy ones and at this busy time of the year I turn my back on dishes with vigorous demands of split second timing. <#> I have arrived at a selection of pies such as Snap Crackle Chicken; tender strips of chicken tossed in Parmesan cheese and served with slices of aubergine and a rich tomato sauce, or a Crustless Quiche which does not require making and rolling out pastry. <#> Try the Bacon Muffins which go so well with a glass of Mulled Wine punch and create that instant cosy appeal by pulling up a chair and sitting down in front of a Calor gas living flame fire with instant heat and atmosphere at the press of a button. </p>
 <p> <#> So many of these pies can be made in advance but I remember vividly one day was set aside as the main baking and cooking day. <#> How easy life would have been with the Cannon Classique cooker with two large ovens ideal for the family who enjoys entertaining or have a lot to feed. </p>
 <p> <#> Punch is always popular and the smell of Mulled Wine punch simmering on top of the hob is wonderful. <#> Don't forget to offer the choice of <}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+> </}> non-alcoholic drink for those who may prefer it. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Raised chicken and ham pie </bold> </h>
 <h> <ul> <#> Hot Water Crust Pastry </h>
 <p> <#> 170 ml/6fl oz water <#> 115g/4 oz butter <#> 115g/4 oz lard or unsaturated fat <#> 450g/1 lb flour <#> 1 egg yolk <#> 1 tsp salt </ul> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Filling </bold> </h>
 <p> <ul> <#> 450g/1 of cooked chicken pieces <#> 225g/ 1/2 lb cooked ham <#> 225g/ 1/2 lb mushrooms lightly cooked <#> 1 dsp chopped parsley <#> salt, pepper, pinch cayenne pepper </ul> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> To make the pastry </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This quantity makes enough to line a 1.41 (2.5 pint) mould or 200mm (8 in) cake tin. </p>
 <p> <#> Warm the mixing bowl and sieve the flour and salt into it. <#> Make a well in the centre and hide the egg yolk in the flour. <#> Heat the butter, lard and water in a saucepan, and when boiling make sure that the fat has melted before boiling point is reached. <#> Pour into the flour and egg, mixing well with a spoon or knife. <#> When the dough has cooled slightly turn onto a floured surface and knead until the pastry is smooth. <#> It is a good idea to cover the pastry with cling film and leave it to rest at this stage for 15-20 minutes. <#> Then use two-thirds to line the pie dish (keeping one-third for the topping) pressing firmly into the tin. </p>
 <p> <#> Pack the cooked chicken, ham and mushrooms well into the tin, brush the top edge on the pastry with beaten egg, place the rolled-out third of pastry on top, and, using fingers, seal well on top. <#> Decorate with pastry leaves, and make a hole to allow the steam to escape. <#> Bake at gas 5 for 30-35 minutes. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Crustless Quiche </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> A very easy and quick dish which does not involve the making and rolling of pastry. <#> A variety of fillings can be used. </p>
 <p> <ul> <#> 170g/6ozs self-raising flour <#> 55g/2ozs bran <#> 6 eggs <#> 1/4 teaspoonful salt <#> 85g/3ozs unsaturated margarine <#> 425 ml/ 3/4 pint of milk <#> 1 large onion finely chopped <#> 115g/4 ozs mushrooms <#> 1 small tin salmon <#> 225g/8ozs broccoli frozen <#> Sprinkling of dill and freshly milled black pepper <#> Grated cheese to flavour and garnish </ul> </p>
 <p> <#> Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl, then rub in the margarine. <#> Add the bran. <#> Whisk the eggs, milk and cheese mixing well with the salmon and broccoli. <#> The onion and mushrooms can be slightly cooked in the pan before also adding at this stage. </p>
 <p> <#> Grease a quiche dish, then mixing well pour mixture into the dish and bake in the middle shelf of a preheated oven gas mark 5 for 30 minutes until golden brown and well risen. <#> Cut and serve hot or cold with wedges of lemon. <#> Good with tomato and basil salad. <#> For extra flavour, try a sprinkling of dill and freshly milled black pepper. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Turkey and Almond Crumble with Crisp Celery </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The secret of success with this dish is in the careful making of the buttery breadcrumbs. <#> The addition of a crisp layer of celery gives this dish an element of surprise. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Crumble Topping </bold> </h>
 <p> <ul> <#> 8 slices white bread, crusts removed <#> 55g/2oz butter <#> 1/2 tsp salt <#> 1/2 tsp ground mace <#> 115g/4oz flaked almonds <#> 1 head celery <#> 3 tablespoons chopped <#> parsley </ul> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Sauce </bold> </h>
 <p> <ul> <#> 55g/2oz butter <#> 55g/2oz plain white flour <#> 850 ml/1.5 pints milk <#> 1 chicken stock cube <#> 55g/2oz grated cheese (Parmesan) <#> 450g/1 lb turkey or chicken pieces <#> 1/2 tsp mustard </ul> </p>
 <p> <#> Cut the turkey into bite sized pieces and arrange in a large fairly shallow ovenproof dish. <#> Cooked turkey can be used for this dish but if using uncooked turkey or chicken lightly fry in a pan ensuring the flesh is well cooked and a light golden brown. </p>
 <p> <#> Next make the sauce, melt the fat in a pan, add the flour and blend well with the milk and blended stock cube (dissolve in 2-3 tbsp boiling water) bring to the boil and simmer gently for 1-2 mins. <#> Add the grated cheese and mustard then pour over the turkey pieces. </p>
 <p> <#> Finally make the crumble topping. <#> Melt the butter in a saucepan then add the salt, mace, breadcrumbs and almonds and cook for two mins until the crumbs become well coated and golden brown. </p>
 <p> <#> Layer the celery over the turkey and sauce and then finally sprinkle the crumble topping over the celery. <#> Bake in oven gas mark 5 for 25-30 mins. <#> Serve piping hot garnished with freshly chopped parsley. </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> Bacon Muffins </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> These are delicious served warm with a glass of hot mulled wine. </p>
 <bold> <#> Makes about 14. </p>
 <p> <#> Preparation time: 20-25 mins <#> Cooking time: 35-40 mins <#> Oven setting gas 5 <ul> <#> 85g/3 oz back bacon <#> 340g/12oz self raising flour <#> 2 tsp baking powder <#> 1 tbsp chopped parsley <#> 2 eggs, size 2, beaten <#> 115g/4oz butter, melted and cooled <#> 140ml/ 1/4 pint milk </ul> </p>
 <p> <#> 1. Cut the rind and excess fat off the bacon and finely chop the meat. <#> 2. Sieve the flour and baking powder into a bowl. <#> 3. Stir in the chopped parsley and lightly cooked bacon. <#> 4. Pour in the beaten egg and melted butter. <#> Beat well, adding enough milk to form a dropping consistency. <#> 5. Spoon the mixture into 14 muffin tins or deep patty tins. <#> Bake in a preheated oven for 20-25 mins gas 4. <#> Serve warm. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> What Else Is Buried In Political Mire? </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It is fortunate for Irish politicians that Christmas is about to create a natural break of a week or two in political life in this country. <#> Otherwise the recent cycle of debacles which has already engulfed Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach, Fianna Fail and Labour as partners in government and several individual ministers, might well swamp the entire political system. <#> With each passing day we are getting further evidence of the less-than-wholesome manner in which people in power carry on their business. <#> So far it has not been a pretty sight. <#> The break for Christmas will be a relief. </p>
 <p> <#> There are few people celebrating the revelations of recent weeks. <#> Even the large anti-Fianna Fail lobby in this country are not triumphant about the way the party has been humiliated in recent weeks. <#> The sight of open warfare in Fianna Fail would normally delight political opponents but this time there is an air of despair among the general public because it is obvious that the Labour party is not a lot better when they get their hands on power. </p>
 <p> <#> Whether Fine Gael, Democratic Left or the PDs would be any different if and when they become part of the government we cannot yet tell. <#> But what is about power that makes otherwise sensible and honest men and women behave as as of they owned the country and were unanswerable to the general public? <#> How can members of a government so quickly forget that the basis of their power lies not in the chauffeur-driven Mercedes but in the votes of the plain people of Ireland? <#> If they remembered that salient fact they could scarcely become so contemptuous of the voters. </p>
 <p> <#> This country should have a general election in January so that people of Ireland, in whom power ultimately lies through their franchise, can have their say. <#> It matters little that after the elections we might have roughly the same alignment of political parties in the Dail. <#> After the events of recent weeks all politicians, but particularly Fianna Fail and Labour ones, should be made face the public, knock on doors and answer questions from ordinary people without seeking immunity. <#> It is fair to say that the general public has been shocked and genuinely dismayed at the amount of intrigue and deception which has been shown to operate in government circles in recent weeks. </p>
 <p> <#> What worries people most is this. <#> What we have witnessed in recent weeks may be just the tip of the iceberg. <#> If so much dubious conduct took place in relation to a minor event such as the appointment of a judge, how much more of the same sort of unsavoury conduct may have taken place over the years in connection with far more serious matters - such as the recent Tax Amnesty for instance? </p>
 <p> <#> This newspaper and others have often been savaged by Fianna Fail activists in the past few years for daring to criticise the behaviour of politicians. <#> After the revelations of the past three weeks we are entitled to feel justified in our criticism. </p>

 <h> <#> Forever Flowers </h>
 <h> <#> By Maeve Watt </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> Frances Brown from Newtownards has always loved flowers and she started flower arranging ten years ago, beginning with leisure classes and was then encouraged to do her City and Guilds part 1 and 2. <#> She enjoyed it so much that she decided to teach, got her qualifications and at the moment is teaching in Bangor Tech. </bold> </p>
 <p> <#> ""I REALLY LOVE TEACHING, SEEING OTHER <}> <-> peoples </-> <+> people 's </+> </}> work. <#> I am learning all the time too."" <#> She also loves competitive work where there 's a show and the entrants are given a title. <#> ""You have to interpret the title in flowers and my most recent piece, The Flower Fairies, won up in Antrim. <#> I had to compete again in England and won - the prize was a nice weekend in Glasgow which was great, except that it rained constantly!"" </p>
 <p> <#> Frances also competed in the World Show where she was runner up and won <*> pound sign </*> 500 towards going to South Africa to represent Northern Ireland. <#> ""I was absolutely thrilled. <#> It 's in February and I have to do an exhibit connected with Northern Ireland. <#> I 'm working on it at the moment,"" she laughs. <#> ""But it 's a secret! <#> There 's a World Show every four years, the last one was in New Zealand and the next one is in Edinburgh, so Frances is delighted to be going to South Africa! <#> ""It 'll be a wee bit nerve wracking getting everything over there. <#> If you take anything from here, there are pest controlled regulations and even material has to have a fire proof certificate. <#> Obviously, as I will be depicting something from Northern Ireland, I 'll have to take some stuff over, but you can order flowers there and I 'm busy working the whole thing out at the moment. <#> The plane will be filled with flowers!"" <#> We wish her luck! </p>
 <p> <#> Over the years, everything grown in her garden has been converted for flower arranging. <#> If I 'm doing a wedding, it 's great to be able to go and cut stuff from the garden, nice and fresh, it also keeps the cost down a little,"" smiles Frances. <#> And there 's a lot to learn in flower arranging, it moves on from fashion to fashion and Frances has to make sure that she keeps abreast of the new trends - including dried flower arrangements. </p>
 <p> <#> ""There are different ways of drying and preserving flowers too - you can <}> <+> get </+> </}> glycerine leaves and silicone gel flowers and, of course, some flowers dry naturally."" <#> Her favourite flower is probably the rose because it can be dried as well. <#> They must be picked just before full bloom on a nice dry day and hung upside down in a dark, warm place for about a fortnight. <#> Red and yellow roses are the best colours to dry. <#> Frances has a tip for beginners. <#> ""The best thing to do is to try to compete, starting off in the novice section. <#> The best way to learn is on the show bench where you will get comments from judges and also see other <}> <-> peoples </-> <+> people 's </+> </}> work. <#> ""It 's so enjoyable,"" she laughs, ""You may not always win, but at least if you make a mistake, you 'll know the next time! <#> Frances Brown believes that a bowl of flowers brings a room completely to life and that a room without flowers or plants, is dead. </p>
 <p> <#> With Christmas dinner parties starting to fill up the calendar, Frances has put together a step-by-step guide to creating three very different flower arrangements, guaranteed to brighten up any table setting. </p>
 <h> <#> FLOWERS AND FRUIT </h>
 <p> <#> THE PLASTIC DISH containing a soaked oasis which has been taped down and is sitting in the middle of a vine ring. <#> Just to keep the furniture dry, the ring is lying on a base of cork (1). </p>
 <p> <#> Frances puts a candle in the centre and round the bottom, she has taped on some kebab sticks so that they will go into the oasis and keep the candle in place. </p>
 <p> <#> She is going to use apples, grapes, cones, a pretty tartan ribbon and some little bundles of twigs, some spray carnations and foliage - not anything with a soft leaf that would have to be replaced in the warmth, but ivy and holly which will last a long time. <#> Spray carnations will last longer than most flowers over the Christmas period. </p>
 <p> <#> The ribbon has wired edges to it which makes it sit up nicely and Frances just loops it four times, backwards and forwards before putting a wire tightly round the centre, making sure the wire is extended so that it can go into the oasis. <#> She cuts the end of the ribbon in a vee shape to make it more attractive. </p>
 <p> <#> Secure the apples with kebab sticks into the stem end which will help it sit in the oasis. <#> Put in the candle and the outline of the foliage making sure that the foliage is dipping down because it has to cover the oasis. <#> Put in the apples and grapes which have been wired, on opposite sides and remember to clean the stems of the foliage before use (2). </p>
 <p> <#> Frances uses different foliage including Skimmia, turning the arrangement round all the time to make sure the oasis is hidden. </p>
 <p> <#> She places the flowers, layering them so that there is a pocket of flowers on the opposite sides of the fruit to balance the colour (3). </p>
 <p> <#> Cones are added to finish it off and little pieces of foliage, berries and small bundles of sticks to make it more interesting (4). </p>
 <p> <#> Always make sure there is enough water in the dish to soak into the oasis and spray the arrangement daily to keep it fresh and alive. </p>
 <h> <#> RING OF ROSES </h>
 <p> <#> USING AN OASIS RING which has been soaked in a basin of water (turn the ring upside down and let it soak until the bubbles stop coming out) Frances sets it on a brass tray so that when she waters it, the water doesn't escape onto the top of the table (1). </p>
 <p> <#> She uses gold coloured slimline candles in three different placements with a ribbon (wire edged again) at the base of each one. <#> She also uses artificial gold balls, again in three different placements (2). </p>
 <p> <#> The candles are placed at different levels and the flowers used are rich red roses. <#> Covering the oasis in conifer, turning it round all the time and also placing the foliage on the inside of the ring and on the top so that it is entirely covered (3). </p>
 <p> <#> She also uses variegated holly - the lime green colour goes well in arrangements as it lifts the colour. <#> Frances picks all the foliage apart from the Skimmia, from her own garden. </p>
 <p> <#> She adds some red berries and some red roses to distribute the colours throughout the design (4). <#> (If the roses flop, you can recut them and place the ends in boiling water for half a minute and then float them in a basin of water. <#> They should perk up again!) </p>
 <p> <#> Frances finishes this arrangement by adding ivy leaves which have nice shiny surfaces to cover the oasis. </p>
 <h> <#> GLAMOROUS GOLD </h>
 <p> <#> PUTTING THE SOAKED OASIS into a container that has a spike in the end of it like a candle holder, push it down into the top of a glass container with a piece of gold lame material to wind round it (1). <#> This arrangement is really for a buffet table. </p>
 <p> <#> Frances is going to use white silk poinsettias trimmed with gold and some golden fruit, apples and pears, white September flowers to do the outline and a gold rope with tassels. <#> She drops the material round the glass, tucking it in at the bottom. <#> Frances likes using candles in table arrangements because they 're pretty to look at when eating and for this arrangement, she has used the slimline candles. </p>
 <p> <#> She does the outline with the September flower and some lovely trailing ivy with a few variegated leaves towards the centre. <#> The rope is then dropped down the glass over the material (2) and a cherub is added. <#> His wings have been wired so he can rest in the middle of the arrangement. </p>
 <p> <#> Frances fills in the design with poinsettias and foliage - you can bend silk flowers which makes them easier to use. <#> She adds some gilded fruit (3). <#> This arrangement, whilst looking extremely elegant, is reasonably easy to assemble. </p>

 <#> 22/10/97
 <p> <#> Dear Aoife, <#> Thanks for your letter. <#> Glad to hear that your Ph.D has worked out, although you must have been a bit worried for a while. </p>
 <p> <#> Well, I 'm still in London but I 'm probably heading home early next week. <#> Bad news and some good news on the job front. <#> None of the interviews I did here resulted in job offers. <#> Basically, my problem <}> <+> is </+> </}> I haven't done any work experience and therefore they are questioning my commercial awareness and my commitment to commercial law! <#> It 's very disheartening but I 'm remaining philosophical in believing that everything happens for a reason. <#> The good news is that the firm in New York called me and said they wanted to hire me. <#> I can't go yet though because they have to get a work permit or some sort of immigrant visa for me. <#> They are working on that at the moment but it takes quite a while to process. <#> So I just have to wait and see what happens. <#> I 'm hoping that I 'll be able to go before Christmas. <#> At least they sound like they do want me to come over so I 'm quite positive about the whole thing. <#> Once I get some work experience I could reapply for jobs in London or I 'm actually thinking of staying in New York and taking the New York Bar exams. <#> The law degree from here is recognised over there so I wouldn't have to do three years of law school, I 'd just have to do a crash course to prepare for the exams. <#> It certainly wouldn't be easy but I could qualify much quicker over there than here. <#> Tommy is actively encouraging me to stay in New York and qualify there if I get the chance as he doesn't recommend doing the LPC. <#> He is bored to tears I think. <#> I 've seen him a few times since I 've been here. <#> Before Bill left, we met up a couple of times, once with Ed and Ronnie and Laura (PGCE). <#> I saw him a couple of weeks ago Ð we met for a drink in a pub in Fleet Street. <#> Ed organised it but never turned up (apparently Pierre was over for the weekend so that may have been this excuse!) <#> Tommy 's friend William was there (one of the guys who was at the Hughes Ball) and Dan McShea, the Canadian guy who was on the LLM. </p>
 <p> <#> Tommy rang on Friday but I wasn't here so I must give him a call and meet up before I leave. <#> I went to Normandy last Wednesday 'til Sunday. <#> My cousin Laura was visiting from New York and she and her friend Rex who work for the same bank in London rented a house so she asked me to come too. <#> There was also Rex ' brother and a friend of his from Oxford. <#> It was really good fun. <#> We took the ferry from Portsmouth to Cherbourg and the house was about 1/2 an hour from there. </p>
 <p> <#> This weekend I 'm thinking of going to Cambridge on Friday and then Nottingham on Saturday to see my Italian friend Tina. <#> I also want to see a friend of mine who 's in Chester doing the LPC. <#> I haven't seen him since graduation last year and if I don't see him now I won't see him for ages. <#> I 'm not sure I can fit all that in one weekend! </p>
 <p> <#> I 've spoken to Bill a few times since he left. <#> I called him on Monday night Ð his mother answered the 'phone and told him that it was someone with an English accent so he said he knew it was me! <#> He 's in good form but a bit bored although he 's busy filling in Ph.D funding applications. <#> He finally got his e-mail to work and has had lots of messages. <#> He heard from Steve Wright who seems to be settling well in LA. <#> He said all the women are hot but not very smart so you don't get very much intelligent conversation!! <#> Charles and Julia are doing very well and are very excited about their imminent arrival. <#> Due date is November 27th. </p>
 <p> <#> Bill 's brothers are on reading week from college so he and Tommy are going camping in Algonquin Park for a few days. <#> I 've really missed him since he left so if I end up in New York at least I 'll be able to go visit. </p>
 <p> <#> Well, I must go. <#> I 'm busy here painting the bathroom for my lovely sisters! <#> So I must get that second coat on! <#> When I go home I 'm planning a trip to Belfast to visit several people who I haven't seen in ages so I 'll give you a call when that happens. <#> I 'm going to work for my brother in Dublin and stay with Margaret at: <#> 199A Griffith Avenue, <#> Drumcondra, <#> Dublin 9 Ð so now you can keep track of me! </p>
 <p> <#> Take care, <#> Lots of love, <#> Violet.</p>

IrishEnglish,can,There is still more that you can do to improve your security,dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,<W2D-018$A>,"
 <h> <bold> <#> Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This booklet is intended to provide you with some basic information on HOME PROTECTION. <#> We know that your home is very special to you, as the place where you feel safest and most relaxed. <#> It also contains some very valuable property, if not in a commercial sense, then certainly in terms of its sentimental worth. <#> There is no insurance policy which could compensate you adequately for the loss and upset which can result from a burglary. <#> That 's why you should minimise the risk of having your home broken into, and the contents stolen. </p>
 <p> <#> There are some very simple steps you can take, which will help improve the physical security of your home, and allay some of your fears. <#> Many of these will cost you nothing more than a few moments of your time. <#> Other measures may be more expensive, and may range in price from several pounds to several hundred pounds - but we 'll have a look at some of these later on. <#> It 's best to begin with the most obvious and easiest steps. </p>
 <p> <#> As a starting point for considering the safety of <}> <-> you </-> <+> your </+> </}> home, let 's look at it from the burglar 's point of view. <#> What type of signs would help him target your home? </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Signs of vacancy </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Burglars tend to be skilled in recognizing signs which indicate that a particular house is vacant. <#> This means that it is unlikely that they will be disturbed on entry and helps to explain why 80 <*> per cent sign </*> of burglaries take place in unoccupied homes. </p>
 <p> <#> The following are some of the things a burglar looks for: <#> A build-up of milk on the door-step <#> A build-up of papers and advertisements in the letter box
 <#> A build-up of letters in the hall visible from outside <#> Blinds pulled down, or curtains across during the day <#> No lights on at night, or just 'dead' lights like in the porch, or the hall <#> Lights on during the day <#> Front gates closed and no car in the drive way <#> Notes left for delivery men or callers <#> Uncut lawn and untidy garden </p>
 <p> <#> Obviously any of these occurring by itself does not confirm that the premises are unoccupied. <#> But they are some of the criteria thieves use to target their victims. <#> There more signs there are, the more certain they can be that nobody is at home. </p>
 <p> <#> These tell-tale signs can be easily avoided by a little personal care and attention. <#> If you live in a neighbourhood Watch Area, it is likely that you and your neighbour will already have developed a greater awareness of the need to take such precautions. <#> If you are not a member, why not make some enquiries about the advantages of this crime prevention programme. </p>
 <p> <#> Modern technology can also be of assistance in quite inexpensive ways. <#> For example, you can purchase a time switch quite cheaply and use this to turn on and off lights automatically at the appropriate times. <#> It can also be used to control radios and televisions to simulate that someone is present in the house; but do make sure that you follow the manufacturer 's recommendations and don't compromise your fire safety. </p>
 <p> <#> An outside light, especially at the rear of the building can also act as a deterrent - burglars certainly don't want to be seen. <#> This may go against your natural desire for privacy, which may also require fences and hedges. <#> Sometimes there can be a trade-off between privacy and security, with the 'happy medium' being a matter of personal choice. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> An open invitation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> After you have eliminated any clear indications of unoccupancy, the next step is to make sure that you do not invite the burglar in through carelessness. <#> Most burglars are opportunists and will select the easiest target that they can find. </p>
 <p> <#> Don't offer him assistance by: <#> Leaving any window open. <#> Some people do this for ventilation forgetting that burglars will take advantage of the smallest opening. <#> Leaving external doors unlocked. <#> Leaving a key on a string, under a door-mat, or in some other 'good hiding place' outside. <#> Failing to secure side doors, allowing entry to the back of the premises which is more vulnerable to attack. <#> Failing to keep garages and sheds locked. <#> Not only do they contain valuable property, but also tools which may help the burglar to gain access to your home. </p>
 <p> <#> Also make sure that ladders are not left in the open, or in insecure positions. <#> In most circumstances the thief will tend not to carry tools, or equipment with him for fear of detection. <#> Don't make his job any easier by providing them at the 'site'. </p>
 <p> <#> Simply by taking these straight forward crime prevention measures brings you well on the road to achieving greater household security. <#> These measures alone will decrease the likelihood that you will be the burglar 's next victim. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Keeping the intruder out </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> There is still more that you can do to improve your security. <#> At this stage you have reached a point where any would be burglar can only gain entry by physically breaking into your home. <#> In many cases he can be deterred from doing this by the proper use of locks and bolts. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> WINDOWS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Windows form a popular entry point for burglars, and it has been estimated that more than two thirds gain entry in this way. <#> The risk partly depends on two factors. <#> The first is how accessible the window is, and the second is how clearly visible the window is to your neighbours and passers-by. <#> Therefore, those windows at the rear and side of the building, which can be easily reached from the ground, or via pipes, or adjoining roofs are most vulnerable. </p>
 <p> <#> Obviously windows which have not been left open must be broken, or prised to allow the burglar to put his hand through to release any catch or fitting. <#> If window locks are fitted, his task is so much more difficult. <#> This may force him to smash an area large enough to climb through. <#> Breaking glass may attract attention and few burglars will want to risk it. </p>
 <p> <#> Furthermore, do remember not to leave the keys to the window locks where they can be seen, or are within easy reach. <#> The style of the window can also have a bearing on vulnerability. <#> For example, certain types of louvre windows are particularly risky wherein the glass panels can easily be removed. </p>
 <p> <#> Various types of window locking devices are displayed below.. <#> You should choose a lock which is suitable to your window, whether it is a sash window, a french window, <}> <-> of </-> <+> or </+> </}> whether it is wooden or metal framed. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> DOORS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Doors, particularly those at the side and rear of the dwelling are also likely entry points. <#> Consequently, they require special attention. <#> It is also important to consider any door which gives access to these sites, including garage doors. <#> Many of the better quality locks will give extra protection against attacks from <}> <-> jemmys' </-> <+> jemmies </+> </}> , crowbars, hand-drills and picks - some of the favourite tools of the burglar. <#> On the other hand, many outside doors are still being fitted with a type of lock which can be slipped open with a piece of plastic. </p>
 <p> <#> Displayed....are two types of locks which are commonly found on external front doors. <#> A rim lock <}> <-> and </-> </}> is attached to the surface of the door. <#> A mortice lock which is superior. </p>
 <p> <#> We recommend that as a minimum precaution all external doors are fitted with the five lever mortice lock. <#> In this case, the lock is actually recessed into the door itself, as can be seen from the drawing. <#> Door leaf should be at least 44mm in thickness to allow adequate strength after <}> <-> mortise </-> <+> mortice </+> </}> lock has been fitted. </p>
 <p> <#> Mortice security bolts serve a similar purpose and can be used independently, or to augment existing security arrangements. <#> Hinge bolts also serve to boost door security and are especially useful on doors with exposed hinges, offering protection even should the hinges themselves be removed. </p>
 <p> <#> The quality of the door and the materials used, will also <}> <-> effect </-> <+> affect </+> </}> its strength against attack. <#> If the design of the door is weak, then it will be difficult to compensate for this by using high security lock. <#> For example, hollow doors are not suitable for external fittings, and should be confined to internal use only. </p>
 <p> <#> Besides the illustrations of some typical door locks, currently on the market, we have included door limiters. <#> These provide some security when you are at home by helping you to control access. <#> You should also consider fitting a door viewer. <#> This will enable you to identify the caller without having to open the door. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> FIREARMS <*> ampersand </*> AMMUNITION </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> If you are the holder of licensed firearms, or ammunition, you should take special precautions to ensure their safety. <#> A steel gun locker is a worthwhile purchase which will afford a high level of security and give a life-time 's service. <#> If you don't have one of these then keep the firearm and ammunition separately, and remove the firing mechanism and magazine. <#> This will prevent the easy unlawful use of the weapon, not only by criminals but also by inquisitive children. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> OTHER PROPERTY </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Whatever the nature of your property, be sure that you have an adequate record of it and that, where possible, it is also marked with your own property number. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> RECORDING PROPERTY </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The benefits of marking property are that: <#> It greatly increases the likelihood of stolen property being returned to the owner. <#> As you probably already know, a great deal of property remains unclaimed in Garda possession as the owners cannot be identified. <#> It will make the property less attractive to the thief. <#> He will not be able to readily dispose of property that is marked and can be easily identified. <#> Generally, he will not want to steal goods that he cannot resell. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Inside the house </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> When you are away from home, we recommend that you normally should not lock weak internal doors. <#> They offer very little resistance and may result in unnecessary damage. <#> If the intruder has gained access it is unlikely that these will prove realistic deterrents. <#> For similar reasons it is also felt that cupboards and bureaus should not be locked. <#> Moreover, in no circumstances should these ever be considered as providing sufficient protection for your valuables. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> CASH </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In the first instance, you should limit the amount of cash left in the home. <#> Don't leave money in dishes or jars in anticipation of paying some bill. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> JEWELLERY </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> All jewellery should be locked out of sight when you are not at home - either in a small floor safe or some similar protective casing. <#> You could just as easily protect it by leaving it with a relative or friend, particularly if you intend to be away for some time. <#> Some banks also offer this holding facility. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> BICYCLES </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Bicycles are very valuable items of property <}> <-> some times </-> <+> sometimes </+> </}> carelessly left around the house. <#> Once off the street there is a tendency to forget the danger from thieves. <#> However, many bicycles are stolen from backyards and side passages. <#> Always have your bicycle locked when not in use. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> PROPERTY MARKING NUMBER </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> A property marking number is simply a specific number used to identify your property. <#> We recommend that you use your date of birth as initials, for example: </p>
 <p> <#> If your name is John A. Dunne, born on the 13/11/43, then your property number would be 131143 JAD. <#> You put this number on all appropriate items of your property, using one of the methods outlined below. <#> You then fill out a card with this information, and return it to your local Garda Station.</p>
 <p> <#> The items which should be marked are those most likely to be stolen, especially portable electrical and mechanical goods. <#> In the event of property being stolen and later recovered, the Gardai will have no trouble in matching the property with its rightful owners. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> PROPERTY MARKING </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> You can mark your property with any of the following. <#> 1. An ultra-violet pen <#> 2. An electric engraver <#> 3. An indelible marker <#> 4. An etching tool <#> 5. A series of metal punches, the precise method will depend on the nature of the property that you are marking; on whether or not it is glass, metal, wood, fabric etc. <#> There are some items of property which you will not want to mark because of their individual character or value, e.g. crystal, items of jewellery or antiques. <#> Those items should be photographed. </p>
 <p> <#> If you wish to know more about the property marking scheme, contact your local Garda Station. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Conclusion </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This booklet has been confined to suggesting basic ways and means of increasing your home protection. <#> That 's why it has not dealt with alarms, safes, security fencing, etc. <#> We do not want you to feel that you have to convert your home into a fortress, as a little thoughtfulness can prevent many burglaries from occurring. <#> However, should you feel that you may require these types of systems to meet your personal needs and circumstances, always make sure that they comply with accepted standards as in the case of the current Irish Standards for burglar alarms I.S.199. <#> Additional professional advice can be obtained freely from the Crime Prevention Officer. </p>
 <p> <#> You now know that crime prevention does not need to be expensive or technical. <#> Common sense and a few pounds will put you on the road to greater security - start with the doors, and then move on to the windows until you have a security system in which you can trust. <#> The Gardai are always prepared to assist you in this development. <#> Call your local station should you have any questions related to this subject. </p>

 <h> <#> <bold> MORNING VIEW </bold> </h>
 <h> <#> <bold> Violence must not set the agenda </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> SDLP leader John Hume 's credibility as a constitutional politician is wearing a bit thin these days as he assumes an increasing role as an apologist for the IRA and Sinn Fein. </p>
 <p> <#> The Foyle MP 's latest intervention on behalf of the Provos throws the gauntlet down to the Government and shores up the republican argument that there will be no peace until dialogue is opened up with the terrorists. </p>
 <p> <#> As the IRA mortars Heathrow Airport and murders innocent people on the streets of Northern Ireland, the SDLP and Sinn Fein leaders not surprisingly use a similar form of words to justify the Government parleying with the terrorists, instead of urging them to introduce measures to round them up and bring them to justice. </p>
 <p> <#> Hume, maintaining the IRA was only firing blanks at Heathrow Airport, says the Government should launch new talks with Sinn Fein to exploit <quote> ""the best opportunity in 20 years"" </quote> for peace in Northern Ireland. <#> Adams says the search for peace remains the <quote> ""greatest challenge facing everyone"" </quote> . </p>
 <p> <#> Having schemed for a year on the best way of edging Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom, the pair are now audaciously demanding that the IRA and Sinn Fein be allowed a central role in dialogue that will decide on a political solution here. </p>
 <p> <#> The small matter of guns and explosives under the table while the Provos talk ""peace"" is of no consequence to the two men.<#> Neither is the view of the unionist majority community in the Province whose citizenship would be gravely threatened if such a treacherous assembly line was set up. </p>
 <p> <#> Not surprisingly, support for this line is coming from Labour 's Kevin McNamara, who believes that IRA/Sinn Fein have not yet totally rejected the Downing Street Declaration. <#> But so far the Government has spurned the overtures, probably not out of conviction - more out of the realisation that such a move would trigger a dramatic deterioration in the climate in Northern Ireland leading eventually to a doomsday situation which would tragically engulf all the people of these islands. </p>
 <p> <#> John Hume has significantly moved outside the parameters of the Downing Street Declaration with his demand for talks with the IRA before it calls a permanent cessation of violence and one can only assume that the long-term agenda he is now following for Northern Ireland is identical to the aspirations of those in the Provisional republican movement. <#> The right of the unionist majority to remain British is certainly not part of the scenario he is hatching nor is it in the thinking of those he is finding common cause with these days. </p>
 <p> <#> Northern Ireland is being pushed dangerously to the precipice by minority politicians whose form of Irish nationalism leaves little room for accommodation with the greater number of people who believe that their interests are best served in maintaining the Union. </p>
 <p> <#> Dictating a political agenda at gunpoint can have no place in a proper democracy and, were the IRA and Sinn Fein to succeed in bombing the Government to the discussion table, it would herald a disastrous watershed in Anglo-Irish affairs. </p>
 <p> <#> The Government has got to urgently arrest the situation by making it crystal clear that those engaged in terrorist violence will have no place in any dialogue on the future administration of Northern Ireland, unless they totally renounce violence and surrender their arms, ammunition and explosives. </p>
 <p> <#> It must also move on to involve in discussions those parties who believe a meaningful form of government can be created within the constitutional confines of Northern Ireland. </p>

 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> VOICE OF THE PEOPLE </ul> </bold> </h>
 <h> <it> <bold> <#> Public pay is the key to growth </it> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> THE PROSPECTIVE political partners are just now finalising their programme for what they describe as a <it> Government for Renewal. </it> <#> If they can indeed provide a sense of renewal after the appalling conflicts of the last few weeks, then their new administration will be widely welcomed. </p>
 <p> <#> But they do have a major task ahead. <#> The current negotiations are private, but we must assume that public sector pay is one of the key problems to be sorted out. <#> If this issue is not tackled head on, then this incoming Government will fail to deliver the economic and social benefits which are the essential dynamo for growth. </p>
 <p> <#> The entire thrust of recent government policy has been to tax wage earners highly, to penalise industry and to extract the very maximum taxation on all economic activity. <#> This extra money has been expropriated from the public by the Revenue Commissioners with ruthless efficiency. <#> That has been the real policy of the outgoing government and the Revenue Commissioners have carried out that policy dutifully. <#> That is their job. </p>
 <p> <#> The money collected has been transferred from individual wage earners in the private sector directly into the pockets of those working in the public sector. <#> Thus, since 1987 wages in the public sector have risen by 70 <*> per cent sign </*> , compared with a 44 <*> per cent sign </*> increase for everyone else. </p>
 <p> <#> Not only has that policy been unfair, it has had the effect of seriously slowing down, if not strangling, firms which otherwise would have been able to offer more employment. <#> That policy has to stop, it has to be reversed. </p>
 <p> <#> The outgoing Government constantly told us how good they were, but there was a large element of bluff in all their insistent assurances. <#> In fact, the last Government was held to ransom by the public sector. <#> The price was paid dearly by the unemployed and by those tens of thousands of bright young people who had to emigrate. <#> The funds which should have generated jobs were swept away into the public purse. <#> That was the true record of the last Government. </p>
 <p> <#> It was a policy which denied hundreds of thousands of our young people a right to live their lives, and to develop their careers here. <#> Those educated young people who are working in London, Birmingham, Paris and Berlin and as illegals in the United States have been cheated also of their Irish inheritance. <#> That policy can be changed, it must be changed. </p>
 <p> <#> The incoming Government must reduce taxes for lower paid workers. <#> That is the only way in which their standard of living can increase. <#> The new administration must insist on striking a more equitable balance between the public and the private sectors. </p>
 <p> <#> We believe that the Democratic Left, Fine Gael and the Labour Party will receive a strong, positive response if, together as a united front, they adopt a policy of social reform, based on equality and justice. </p>
 <p> <#> The Democratic Left is a Party with concise and practical ideas on the creation and the distribution of wealth and we do not believe that they are in any way the Party of extremists, as they are sometimes portrayed. </p>
 <p> <#> Similarly, once the Labour Party abandon their excessive use of shallow, public relations hyperbole and empty moral platitudes, they will gain greatly in public respect and will be in a better position to implement policies of genuine reform. <#> Fine Gael should also be able to work well with these partners because, despite its traditional middle class support, it has always been inspired by popular radicalism which was epitomised over a generation ago by Declan Costello 's <it> Just Society </it> document. <#> For all these reasons we believe that the partners share a common idealism and zeal for reform. </p>
 <p> <#> The new partners certainly have the potential and they have the will. <#> All they require is a genuine unity of purpose, a spirit of tolerance and a determination to be truly loyal to each other, at least for their term in office. <#> It can be done. <#> In the interests of the country it must be done. </p>

 <h> <#> Career decisions: Working out the next step </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> Making decisions about your future career can be daunting, but if you do nothing to plan your future, you can be sure that nothing will happen. <#> Few graduates arrive at a satisfying career by chance so read this section to get some advice on how to make sound career decisions. </bold> </p>
 <h> <#> It 's your choice </h>
 <p> <#> Making a career decision is something that you must do for yourself Ð but it 's almost always easier if you enlist the help of friends, family and careers advisers. </p>
 <p> <#> The first step is to realise that YOU have a decision to make and that only YOU can move things along. <#> For instance, talking to a friend or careers adviser will help you to recognise things that you do well, your strengths and weaknesses and to identify other skills such as team work that employers will be looking for when they recruit. </p>
 <p> <#> Ask yourself questions such as: <#> <*> bullet point </*> what are my achievements? <#> <*> bullet point </*> what do my achievements say about me as a person? <#> <*> bullet point </*> what are my strengths and weaknesses? <#> <*> bullet point </*> what sort of job will I find interesting and rewarding? </p>
 <p> <#> While these questions are not paramount in your day to day activities they are quite critical in the process of making the transition from university to employment. <#> You can do it! <#> It is worth the effort to identify your skills and interests, your values and what motivates you. <#> When it comes to selecting jobs and filling in application forms you will spend less time scratching your head in search of an elusive answer and more time providing evidence that you fit the employer 's criteria. <#> You are also likely to be more content with your choice than someone who wanders along waiting for a bolt of lightning to strike them on the way to a lecture. <#> Career choice tends to occur not as a sudden revelation but as a result of a process which you start and you manage. </p>
 <p> <quote> <bold> <#> ""If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else."" </bold> </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> Dr LJ Peter, Canadian educator </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Making your decision Ð overcoming obstacles </bold> </h>
 <h> bold> <#> Getting to know yourself Ð on computer </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Technology can prove useful here. <#> You need to identify attitudes, personality traits and skills that might help you choose suitable job areas. <#> For example you might know that some of the following are important for you: <#> a) a job working with people Ð advising, guiding them or caring for their physical and/or emotional health. <#> b) a job where you want to see the end product of your endeavours such as project management, management consultancy etc. <#> c) a job where you need to motivate, manage and develop other staff and colleagues. <#> d) a job which is fast moving and change-orientated. </p>
 <p> <it> <#> Prospect Planner </it> is a powerful interactive computer package which can help you analyse all these factors in a rational logical manner. <#> It allows you to build up profiles of the skills you want to use in work; your personal values in relation to work and will, if you ask it, provide lists of jobs that match the profiles you construct. </p>
 <p> <#> However, a word of caution Ð the programme is great but be prepared to get a long list of jobs. <#> Some may seem at the least mildly entertaining, others somewhat strange, but remember the computer applies logic based on the information you input. <#> Thinking about why it suggests you should become a member of the clergy, an accountant or even a careers adviser can be useful because it will enable you to identify the pattern and skill of matching yourself to jobs. <#> If you can make this connection you are well on the way to making informed and successful career decisions. <#> Finally, <it> Prospect Planner </it> lets you store and/or print off the work you do. <#> Do speak to a careers adviser if you are unsure about any part of your printout. <#> <it> Prospects Planner </it> is available in the Careers Service. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Getting to know yourself Ð on paper </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> If you prefer a less dynamic approach, Queen 's Careers Service has several good books to guide you through this process. <#> For example, <it> No idea about a career? </it> by Chris Phillips or <it> What colour is your parachute? </it> by R. Nelson Bolles may be most appropriate for your needs. <#> Do try both approaches to find out which tool Ð computer or paper Ð best suits you. </p>
 <h> <bold> <h> Graduate employment </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In recent years graduate employment has changed and the signs are that change will continue. <#> Driven by technology and competition, organisations tend to be leaner and flatter in structure with a focus on results. <#> The small business sector continues to expand with a strong emphasis on entrepreneurship. <#> So whilst the traditional areas of graduate employment may have changed, there is still significant demand for graduates, particularly those who can present an effective combination of academic achievement, work experience and personal and employability skills. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Skills employers look for </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Remember that employers want to recruit the best graduate for the job. <#> To enable them to distinguish between applicants they ask that graduates offer a profile of skills relevant to work and progression within it. <#> The current buzz word for this profile is 'employability skills' Ð ie skills which are work related and central to job success. </p>
 <p> <#> Broadly these skills can be views under four main headings: </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Specialist </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It helps to be an expert at something, eg marketing, tax accounting, family law, aerospace engineering, marine biology, organisational psychology. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Generalist </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It helps to have general business skills and knowledge, eg finance/basic accounting, written communication, problem solving, use of IT. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Connected </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It helps to be a team player, eg management skills, meetings skills, negotiation skills, networking skills, presentation skills. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Self-reliant </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It helps to be able to work alone as well as with others, eg confidence, self-awareness, action planning, political awareness. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Developing your employability skills </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> These skills are essentially work-related, central to job success and you should consider ways of developing them. <#> Here are some examples of how to develop them: <#> 1. Register for the Skills to Succeed programme which has been developed and is delivered by staff from the Careers Service. <#> The programme lasts for two hours per week over one semester and will help you to: <#> <*> bullet point </*> identify the skills developed through study and part-time work <#> <*> bullet point </*> develop knowledge in relation to employer expectations of graduates <#> <*> bullet point </*> demonstrate employability skills <#> <*> bullet point </*> increase your awareness of the range of graduate opportunities available to you <#> <*> bullet point </*> acquire increased confidence and competence at handling selection methods used by graduate recruiters. </p>
 <p> <#> Successful completion of this course will lead to the award of a University Certificate in Career Management and Employability Skills. </p>
 <p> <#> 2. A level 2 undergraduate module in career management and employability skills is available to second year students during first and second semesters. <#> This provides a sound basis for if you are considering taking a year out on placement or if you want to build employability skills into your degree. <#> Find out more about the Skills to Succeed programme and the module in Career Management and Employability from Queen 's Careers Service. </p>
 <p> <#> 3. Consider building the learning for Work module into your degree. <#> This is available to Level 2 and 3 students as a free-standing module. <#> It provides undergraduates with an opportunity to develop the skills and competences they will need in their future careers through project work. <#> Find out more from the Centre for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (CELT), 75 University www.qub.ac.uk/celt/module. </p>
 <p> <#> 4. Get involved with a student society of Student Consultative Committee (SCC). <#> Remember Ð you will need to be active in these groups in order to develop skills. <#> Turning up to a meeting isn't enough. </p>
 <p> <#> 5. Make the most of casual or part-time jobs. <#> You will often get more responsibility if you ask for it or demonstrate that you can cope with it. <#> Go on in-house training courses if available Ð a customer care or telesales course might give you an edge over others at interview. </p>
 <p> <#> The Students ' Jobshop@Queen 's can help you find part-time work Ð www.qub.ac.uk/jobshop. </p>
 <p> <#> 6. You can develop your skills through social activities related to your personal interests, eg coaching or captaining sports teams, fund raising for a charity, doing voluntary youth or community work. </p>
 <p> <#> 7. Use vacations constructively Ð get a casual job, or better still and undergraduate vacation placement (read <it> Work Experience Bulletin </it> regularly) or travel. <#> Look for and make the most of opportunities available Ð employers are not impressed with the <quote> 'I didn't know about that' </quote> approach. <#> Section 4, Work experience may give you some ideas, as will the <it> Queen 's Guide to Work Experience </it> , available from the Work Placement Centre, 8 Malone Road. </p>
 <p> <#> 8. Take a year out Ð an invaluable way of developing the skills that employers seek. <#> The Careers Service advertises semester and year out placements throughout the year. </p>
 <p> <#> 9. Be aware that through studying for your degree you can develop, for example, time management, team work and presentation skills. </p>
 <p> <#> Remember developing work-related and interpersonal skills and enjoying your time at university are not mutually exclusive. <#> Just think about what you can do on a day to day basis and relate it to the bigger picture Ð easy when you think about it! </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> To summarise </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> There are several resources available to help you to make career decisions. <#> It will help if you: </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 1. Begin to plan your future early.</bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This sounds as boring as watching paint dry but it doesn't have to be. <#> Many things you do at university will help you to make decisions. <#> The trick is to be able to see these activities for what they are and for what they can say about you to an employer (a moment 's thought might get you an interview for a job). </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 2. Don't expect a career to just happen.</bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Few people can truthfully say that their career decisions have been due completely to chance. <#> YOU are the lead player in this process and YOU need to make decisions. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 3. Spend as much time thinking about yourself and what you want from a career as you do in looking for jobs. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Remember that the employers will be matching individuals, not degree transcripts, to jobs. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 4. Are not afraid of getting it wrong. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It is difficult with limited work experience to choose a career. <#> Remember that your first employer and job are unlikely to be your last. <#> As work patterns become more flexible and change to meet market pressures, the likelihood of a job and employer for life becomes less usual. <#> You will probably find that any job, even if you decide that it isn't going to be a career will develop skills that can be transferred to other employment situations. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 5. Always have a <it> back-up plan </it> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Further sources of help </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Look in the bibliography file in the Careers Service for the full range of books available on career choice and decision making. <#> <it> No idea about a career? </it> by Chris Phillips and <it> What colour is your parachute? </it> by R. Nelson Bolles provide useful starting points. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Work experience </bold> </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> Work experience is an essential part of your university experience. <#> It adds value to your degree and greatly improves your employment prospects. </bold> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> What counts as work experience? </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The term 'work experience' is used as an umbrella phrase to cover a wide range of experiences. <#> It could be: <#> <*> bullet point </*> formal work experience Ð as in a sandwich placement within your degree <#> <*> bullet point </*> informal Ð as in summer work, a vacation course, work shadowing or a part-time job <*> bullet point </*> <#> related to extra-curricular activities Ð for example, the student who works on the student newspaper is gaining real insight into journalism. <#> Similarly, participating in the Tutoring in Schools Scheme or being a leader with a youth organisation will be considered relevant experience for entry to postgraduate teacher training. </p>
 <p> <#> In an ideal world the best kind of work experience is that which is directly relevant to your future career plans, for instance: <#> <*> bullet point </*> the history student who wants to pursue a career in museum work and spends a vacation working in the Public Records Office <#> <*> bullet point </*> the engineering student who works one summer with a local engineering company and the second summer doing an IAESTE engineering placement overseas. </p>
 <p> <#> Obviously it helps if you have focused on your future plans because then you can try to shape your work experience. <#> You will find that to get into certain careers an element of work experience will be essential Ð social work and clinical psychology are good examples. </p>
 <p> <#> However, not every student will be able to set up this 'ideal' kind of experience, so don't underrate that part-time job in the supermarket, the bar work, or the temporary clerical job. <#> They all count towards giving you an external perspective and help you develop skills for the workplace. </p>

 <h> <#> GETTING NATURAL LIGHT INTO BUILDINGS </h>
 <h> <#> ANN MCNICHOLL </h>
 <p> <#> It is difficult to overestimate the significance of daylight, and of sunlight, in the character of a building and in the lives of the people who use it. <#> There are, of course, some building types, such as theatres or nightclubs, where being cut off from the world outside is an essential part of the experience. <#> In others, shops or museums for example, daylight may be excluded from large areas of the building so as to give full play to display lighting. <#> But most interiors which are to be occupied by people (as opposed to goods or machinery) need plenty of light and, with global warming and 'Sick Building Syndrome' on our minds, natural light and ventilation have once again become critical determinants in the form our buildings take. </p>
 <p> <#> Daylight is variable and unpredictable. <#> It is these characteristics which account for peoples liking for it and for the sparkle that it brings to the interior of a building but which also make it challenging to work with. <#> We want sunshine and daylight, but we don't like glare, downdrafts, loss of privacy, ultra-violet damage or severe temperature swings. <#> Too much glazing, the wrong kind of glazing, or glazing in the wrong place may produce heat losses or gains which have to be countered by artificial heating or cooling. <#> So, good daylight design must form part of a considered architectural strategy for the building as a whole, controlling and exploiting the available light, maximising its advantages and minimising its disadvantages. <#> Most of the critical decisions are made during the early design stages. </p>
 <p> <#> The design possibilities of the 'window' are, of course, extremely rich. <#> Whether treated as a simple hole in the wall or as a complete three-dimensional element it makes a fundamental contribution to the quality of interior spaces and the external appearance of the building. <#> The way in which it frames a view, captures light, or channels warmth, sound and air, helps determine the character of any room - whether it is intended to be simply humane and comfortable, visually exciting, or solemn, with symbolic and spiritual impact. </p>
 <p> <#> The following paragraphs review some new and traditional daylighting devices and products which can be used to control daylight and sunlight, and to moderate the conflict between good daylighting and a good thermal environment which glazing so often entails. <#> Lightwells, roof monitors and clerestory windows are well established devices for getting light deep into buildings. <#> The atrium can be seen as an elaborated and inhabited lightwell, lightshelves and coated or prismatic glasses as sophisticated shades and blinds, while the concept of the lightpipe or transparent insulation is relatively new. <#> Shading devices per se are not described, but these are as important, and selection of the appropriate type is particularly dependent on local climatic conditions. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Rooflights </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Because the sky is generally brighter at its zenith than near the horizon, a horizontal rooflight is proportionally three times more effective as a source of daylight than a vertical window - and it casts its light over a space in a more uniform way. <#> Direct sunlight can be diffused by translucent glazing and glare controlled by baffles. <#> Very beautiful effects can be created by fitting angled reflectors below the rooflight or locating one beside a wall, so that ceilings or walls are washed with light. </p>
 <p> <#> A disadvantage of the horizontal rooflight, compared to a vertical window, is that it collects more light and heat in summer than in winter - usually the opposite of what is desired. <#> For this reason vertical or near-vertical rooflights, clerestories, sawtooth or roof monitors are often preferred for lighting single-storey deep spaces. <#> They can be oriented North, South, East or West as necessary and screened with conventional shades. <#> The duration and quality of light can be enhanced by placing light-catching scoops on the roof outside the glazing, and the distribution of reflected light into the space below controlled by rooflight geometry. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Lightshelves and Louvres </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The lightshelf, a flat or curved element placed at the window opening above eye level, redirects incoming light onto the ceiling and simultaneously provides shading for the area of the room close to the window. <#> The underside of the shelf can also redirect light from a high-reflectance exterior ground surface onto the floor inside the room. <#> Lightshelves are most efficient when they are external, cause minimal obstruction to the window area, have specular reflective surfaces, and are combined with a ceiling of high reflectance. <#> Interior shelves have been found to be less useful - they obstruct daylight entering the room while providing little compensating benefit. <#> The shading control functions of a fixed lightshelf are least effective for low-angle sunlight, and in northern Europe should generally be considered only if glare is a severe problem, or window size is restricted and internal surfaces (other than ceilings) must be of low reflectance. </p>
 <p> <#> Adjustable louvres with a specular finish on the upper surfaces of their blades are more responsive than lightshelves and, if completely retractable, need cause no obstruction of daylight on overcast days. <#> Sophisticated fixed-louvre systems, incorporating lenses and mirrored faces, are now available. <#> These are custom-made for the particular latitude and facade orientations and can combine shading with redirection of both direct and diffuse light deeper into the building. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Lightpipes and Lightducts </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> These are among the more mechanically complex daylighting devices. <#> Sunlight is collected by heliostats (mirrors controlled by a tracking device), concentrated by means of mirrors or lenses, then directed to the core of the building through shafts or along acrylic rods or fibreoptic cables. <#> Because they depend on direct sunlight, and are relatively expensive to install, they are cost-effective only in climates where blue skies and clean air can be guaranteed for much <}> <-> or </-> <+> of </+> </}> the year. <#> (Energy-efficient back-up lamps can be fixed at the head of the shaft to substitute for sunlight during infrequent overcase conditions.) <#> The recent development of thermo-hydraulic tracking systems powered by solar cells should improve economic viability. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Atria </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The daylight performance of an atrium is complex. <#> Its proportions determine the amount of direct daylight reaching the floor - wide, shallow <}> <-> . </-> <+> , </+> </}> square atria perform better in this respect than do deep, narrow, rectangular ones. <#> The design of the atrium walls significantly affects the distribution of light once it has entered the atrium. <#> Dark finishes reduce internal reflectance and the deeper the atrium the more important this becomes. <#> Windows in the atrium wall reduce reflectance also - the upper walls are the most critical in reflecting incoming light down into the atrium, so it is best to limit windows in this area. </p>
 <p> <#> This arrangement corresponds with the requirements of rooms facing into the atrium - rooms at the upper levels get <}> <-> </-> </}> of light but need protection from glare, while those at the base need to maximise the amount of light they receive. <#> Design strategies include making rooms near the base lower, increasing their floor to ceiling heights, or stepping up the upper floors in successive steps so that all rooms have some view of the sky. <#> (The same principles will apply to a building facade on a narrow street.) <#> The closer the room is to the bottom of the atrium the greater its dependence on light opened from atrium walls and floor. <#> Reflectors may be fixed on the windows of lower rooms to redirect more of the zenithal onto their ceilings, but this is generally cost-effective only when other considerations determine that the reflectances of atrium walls and floors must be low. <#> And while rooms further from the atrium roof may have lower light levels, they may have better light quality in terms of uniform distribution and absence of glare. </p>
 <p> <#> Putting any glass roof over an open court will reduce daylight levels in the court by at least 20 <*> per cent sign </*>, and sometimes by 50 <*> per cent sign </*> or more. <#> So the structure of an atrium roof should minimise obstructions to the glazing area and its connections to the building should be such that light is allowed to wash the atrium walls. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Transparent Insulation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Transparent Insulation Materials (TIM),. which tend to be translucent rather than truly transparent, were initially developed primarily as insulation for Trombe wall assemblies. <#> But because they transmit light, they can also function as a glazing material. <#> There are several categories of TIM, using different materials and a variety of forms - foamed, capillary, honeycomb, fibre and gel. <#> Most need protection on one or both sides by glass or plastic sheets. <#> Light transmission of TIM ranges from 45 <*> per cent sign </*> to 80 <*> per cent sign </*>, with a reduction of approximately 8 <*> per cent sign </*> for each sheet of protective glass used. <#> Insulation values are very much better than for glass. <#> For example, 98mm hexagonal honeycomb polyamid TIM has a light transmission factor of 61 <*> per cent sign </*> combined with an insulation value five times that of a double glazed window. <#> TIM can be incorporated into purpose-made window assemblies by most window manufacturers. <#> Costs tend to be approximately three times those of conventional double-glazed windows. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Glazing Materials </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> A conventional window, single-glazed with clear float glass may transmit approximately 85 <*> per cent sign </*> of the light that falls upon it. <#> Double or triple glazing will reduce light transmission to 70 <*> per cent sign </*> and 60 <*> per cent sign </*> respectively. <#> Where lighting requirements demand larger areas of glass than would be thermally satisfactory, specially treated glass can be used to control heat losses or gains. </p>
 <p> <#> The early tinted glasses reduced solar heat gain to some degree but also cut down daylight transmission and distorted the colour of the landscape outside. <#> Heat absorbing glasses do not reduce daylight transmission to quite the same degree, but reduce heat gain by only 10 <*> per cent sign </*> because a large percentage of the heat absorbed is re-radiated into the interior. <#> Reflective glass blocks solar radiation effectively (reflectances up to 50 <*> per cent sign </*> are available) but, like tinted glass, it blocks light as well as heat, and it continues to do so in winter when heat gain and daylight may be beneficial. <#> Selective 'low-e' double glazing. <#> with a resistance to heat loss equivalent to that of triple glazing, has a light transmission factor of approximately 80 <*> per cent sign </*>. </p>
 <p> <#> Current developments include the responsive chromogenic glasses. <#> Electrochromic glass changes its optical absorption properties and becomes dark or cloudy in response to an externally applied electric field. <#> The opacity disappears when the field is reversed. <#> It can be readily integrated into a responsive building climate control system. <#> Thermochromic glass switches between a heat-transmitting and a heat-reflecting state at selected temperature thresholds and photochromic glass darkens and lightens in response to changes in light intensity. <#> At <}> <-> presen,t </-> <+> present, </+> </}> material costs of all three are high and durability uncertain but improving. </p>
 <p> <#> Glass to which a holographic film has been applied does not block radiation but diffracts it. <#> The film can be designed to direct incoming sunlight on to a reflective surface, such as the ceiling, or deep into a room. <#> It can be designed also to reflect sunlight coming from pre-defined angles (high-angle sun on South facades, or low-angle sun on East and West facades, for example). <#> Up to four images containing different 'instructions' can be combined in one layer. <#> A view out through the window is retained but from some viewing angles there is a rainbow effect. <#> Its performance for diffused light is poor, but research is continuing. <#> Costs are not high but at the moment holographic film is not available in the sizes needed for the building industry. </p>
 <p> <#> Prismatic glass (or plastic) controls transmitted light by refraction and can be used to redirect or to exclude sunlight. <#> The direction of incoming daylight is changed as it passes through an array of triangular wedges whose geometry can be designed for particular conditions and orientations. <#> In several recent applications it has been used to reduce glare. <#> Prismatic glass is translucent rather than transparent, so cannot be used where a view outdoors is required. <#> Normally a prismatic refracting panel consists of two sheets with their prismatic faces facing each other to protect them form dust accumulation. <#> They can also be used within double-glazed units. <#> While the sheets themselves are inexpensive, the overall construction cost is higher than for conventional glazing. <#> Prismatic assemblies, including sophisticated systems incorporating silvered wedge-faces and several panel types, are increasingly available. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> CANNABIS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Cannabis is one of the oldest plants cultivated by man. <#> Archaeological evidence from a Stone Age village, excavated on the island of Taiwan, suggests that mankind has been using the plant <it> Cannabis sativa </it> from earliest times. </p>
 <p> <#> The cannabis plant is a very adaptable annual, which can grow in most parts of the world including Ireland. <#> In its chequered career, it has been grown for its long fibres known as hemp fibre, for its seed (hemp seed), used as a source of oil and for bird seed, and most notably for the intoxicating resin produced in its leaves, flowers and fruits. <#> The drug form of cannabis has also been used for many centuries in many countries as a medicine. <#> The characteristic chemicals called cannabinoids (of which there are at least 60 found in the plant) are currently being tested for use in modern medicine to treat glaucoma (a disease which causes gradual blindness), to prevent the nausea and vomiting caused by some anti-cancer drugs, and possibly to treat epilepsy. </p>
 <p> <#> The cannabis plant produces over 400 different chemicals, the most important of which are the main psychoactive compounds, the tetrahydrocannabinols (THC). <#> However other cannabinoids may modify the effect of THC. <#> Different cannabis products contain different amounts of THC. <#> Herbal cannabis, known as marijuana, pot, grass or dope contains between 0 and 11 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC, depending on the source. <#> The resin, known as hashish or 'hash', contains between 1 and 26 <*> per cent sign </*> THC. <#> The resin is squeezed or scraped from the flowering tops of the plant, and then compressed into blocks or slabs and not allowed to solidify. <#> This is the commonest form of cannabis used in Ireland. <#> The strongest form of cannabis is an oil called 'hash oil' prepared by extracting or distilling the cannabinoids from the plant. <#> This form generally contains about 30 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC but samples containing up to 60 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC have been encountered. <#> Abroad it has been noted that the marijuana now on the market is at 7 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC, over 600 times more potent than in 1974 and at times may be even stronger than hash even though the herb form is usually considered to be the weakest form of the drug. <#> Little is known about the THC content of the cannabis drugs available in Ireland. <#> One sample of cannabis grown in Ireland was found to contain nearly 4 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC, while other samples were nearly devoid of any active drug. <#> In Ireland cannabis is usually smoked in home-made cigarettes called 'joints'. <#> In the case of the resin and oil they are usually mixed with tobacco. <#> Cannabis can also be smoked in pipes, made into a drink or put into cakes or biscuits. <#> The variation in THC content described above makes it difficult to accurately predict the effects of a given sample of cannabis. <#> Adding to this variability is the fact that the amount of cannabis used per dose also varies considerably. <#> One study has shown the THC content of street 'joints' to vary from 0.15 mg up to 41 mg where 5 mg of THC per joint would be the minimum for a drug effect to occur. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Legal Status </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> All cannabis products are controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act. <#> Cannabis is included in Schedule 1 which prohibits its medical and non-medical use. <#> It is therefore illegal to grow, produce, supply or possess any of the drugs except in accordance with a licence from the Minister of Health for research or analysis. <#> It is also an offence to allow premises to be used for cultivating, supplying or smoking cannabis. <#> The penalties for possession of small amounts of cannabis herb and cannabis resin for personal use are, for a first offence, a fine of up to <*> pound sign </*> 300 imposed by the District Court or up to <*> pound sign </*> 500 in the Circuit Court. <#> For a second offence, the District Court can impose a fine of up to <*> pound sign </*> 400, which rises to <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 if imposed by the Circuit Court. <#> In the case of a third or subsequent offence, the District Court can impose a maximum fine of <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 or 12 months in jail or both. <#> If the case is heard before a judge and jury, the maximum penalty can be an open-ended fine or 3 years imprisonment, or both fine and prison sentence. <#> Cultivation, supply and possession of the isolated chemicals (cannabinoids) are treated more severely. <#> (See section on Drug Laws for further details). </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Prevalence and Availability. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Cannabis is apparently the most widely used of the illegal drugs but we have no idea of exactly how many Irish people have experimented with it, or use it regularly. <#> There is little doubt that cannabis use has increased dramatically since 1969. <#> A survey of university students in Cork in 1977 showed that 19 <*> per cent sign </*> had experimented with the drug. <#> The most recent indications are that 13 <*> per cent sign </*> of Dublin post primary school children surveyed had used cannabis at least once. <#> The experimentation rate increased with age, with 2.3 <*> per cent sign </*> of those under 13 reporting use of the drug compared to 24.6 <*> per cent sign </*> in those 17 or over. <#> Experimentation rates in rural school children are believed to be lower than those in Dublin. <#> Large numbers of patients attending the Drug Clinic report cannabis use, and prosecutions for cannabis-related offences represent between 60 and 70 <*> per cent sign </*> of all prosecutions under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. </p>
 <p> <#> Prices for different cannabis products range from <*> pound sign </*> 1 per gramme of homegrown herb, to <*> pound sign </*> 3 per gramme of imported herb. <#> Cannabis resin such as Lebanese Gold, Pakistani Black or Moroccan Red can cost between <*> pound sign </*> 5 and <*> pound sign </*> 10 per gramme. <#> The cannabis smuggled into Ireland comes from a variety of countries in North Africa, the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent and America. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Short-Term Effects. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The effects of cannabis depend on a number of factors, including the type of cannabis used (hash and hash oil have greater and longer lasting effects than the relatively weaker marijuana), the way it has been stored (cannabinoids are unstable in light and air), the amount used, the way it is taken, and the experience, mood and expectations of the user. </p>
 <p> <#> When smoked, cannabis exerts its effects very quickly. <#> The effects last up to one hour with low doses, and for several hours with higher doses. <#> When it is eaten or drunk, it takes one to two hours to have an effect. <#> The dose is not easily controlled and unpleasant reactions are more likely and more severe. <#> Inexperienced cannabis users usually require some training in order to recognise the effects of the drug. </p>
 <p> <#> The sought-after effects, referred to as the 'high', include talkativeness, hilarity, euphoria, relaxation and a feeling of slowed time. <#> Usual doses of cannabis also interfere with short-term memory and learning ability, with obvious implications for students and school-children trying to learn while 'high'. <#> The more complex the task the more it is likely to be disrupted. <#> Frequent heavy cannabis users are likely to have poor academic records, high levels of absenteeism from class and a high drop-out rate from the educational system. <#> Moderate doses may also interfere with clarity of speech, resulting in communication of irrelevant words and ideas. <#> Recent studies in adolescents show that impairment of recent memory in heavy cannabis users is still detectable after a 6 week drug-free interval. <#> Adult cannabis users in the U.S. also report memory impairment and 45 <*> per cent sign </*> of those surveyed stated that their ability to concentrate on complex tasks, to think clearly and to get things done was impaired. <#> Motor co-ordination is also impaired at usual dose levels, affecting a person 's ability to operate machinery, fly a plane or drive a car. <#> This impairment lasts for some hours after the 'high'. <#> Evidence continues to increase in other countries showing that cannabis contributes to the high level of fatal car, truck, airplane and train crashes among cannabis users. <#> In many studies cannabis users report higher rates of traffic accidents than non-users and the percentage of those killed or injured in accidents who had been smoking cannabis is the same as for alcohol users. <#> The very common combination of alcohol and cannabis produces greater damage than either drug alone, although little is known about the consequences of using cannabis and other drugs together. </p>
 <p> <#> An increasing number of cannabis users (especially the inexperienced) using the stronger forms of the drug now available report adverse reactions to the drug. <#> These unpleasant reactions include fearfulness, confusion, severe panic and anxiety, paranoid reactions and hallucinations. <#> These reactions, although frequently very frightening, rarely require medical attention and usually respond to reassurance. <#> There would appear to be no danger of an overdose and no deaths in humans have been reported. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Long-Term Effects. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Because widespread regular use of cannabis by such groups as children, adolescents, girls and women is a relatively new phenomenon, the consequences of long-term use, particularly of the highly potent drugs now available, are less conclusively documented than the short term effects. <#> A large number of studies with animals have consistently demonstrated toxic effects at doses comparable to those taken by humans who smoke marijuana several times a day. <#> Studies of human cannabis users have been contradictory in their results and in many cases the evidence is inconclusive. <#> This is probably due to the fact that the correct types of long-term studies on humans have not yet been carried out. </p>
 <p> <#> When burned, cannabis cigarettes produce three times more carcinogenic 'tars' than tobacco and five times more poisonous carbon monoxide. <#> Prolonged heavy use of the drug causes chronic bronchitis, cough, hoarseness, laryngitis and pre-cancerous changes in the lungs similar to those produced by tobacco smoke, except that the changes and lung damage occur more rapidly with cannabis smoke. <#> Cannabis tar is directly carcinogenic in animals and earlier predictions that long-term cannabis use could lead to cases of cancer in humans are proving accurate in that cases of lung, head and neck cancer have been reported in young cannabis smokers. <#> In addition, babies born to mothers who smoked cannabis were, according to one report, ten times more likely to develop acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia than babies whose mothers did not smoke cannabis. </p>
 <p> <#> Cannabis is not usually considered to produce physical dependence, although tolerance to the effects occurs, and physical withdrawal symptoms have been noted after cessation of heavy use. <#> Psychological dependence has been noted in some users. <#> Cannabis increases the workload of the heart and people who suffer from heart disease, angina and blood pressure are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of cannabis. <#> Another high risk group are those with pre-existing mental illness, particularly schizophrenia and depression, because cannabis may trigger off a relapse or make symptoms worse. <#> There has been a steep increase in the number of patients admitted to Swedish psychiatric hospitals with a diagnosis of acute anxiety, delirium, schizophrenia and psychosis attributed to cannabis use. </p>
 <p> <#> Among the other known or suspected long term effects of continuous cannabis use are decreased sperm count and sperm mobility, interference with ovulation and pre-natal development and impaired immune response. <#> There is now a considerable body of evidence concerning the adverse effects of cannabis on both male and female reproductive systems. <#> Not only does the drug affect the secretion of hormones and the reproductive glands directly but it also inhibits sexual activity and produces long-term alterations in the development of the reproductive system in male and female offspring in test animals. <#> In addition, cannabinoid metabolites are highly fat soluble and remain in the body for several weeks. <#> During that time the chemicals are concentrated in areas of the brain known to influence various aspects of sexual behaviour as well as in the endocrine and sex glands. </p>
 <p> <#> There is also increasing evidence of problems arising if cannabis is smoked during pregnancy because the infant is exposed to the drug via the placenta and also through breast milk after it is born. <#> Studies in the U.S. report that up to 27 <*> per cent sign </*> of pregnant women had used cannabis during pregnancy. <#> The babies born to these mothers weighed less than those born to non-users and were significantly shorter in length. <#> The cannabis babies had less muscle mass than normal and were more jittery, more irritable and less attentive. <#> If the mother also used alcohol and tobacco, the combined effect of the three drugs was greater than any individual drug. </p>

 <h> <#> <bold> A HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE FOR PARALLEL IMAGE PROCESSING </bold> </h>
 <h> <#> John Brown and Danny Crookes </h>
 <p> <#> Most published research in the field of parallel image processing has tended to be in the areas of parallel architectures and parallel algorithms. <#> Work on the development of software tools such as languages has generally been less extensive. <#> This paper describes some research which is intended to redress the balance a little, by describing I-BOL - an application-specific high level programming language intended for implementing low-level image processing applications on parallel architectures. <#> In particular, I-BOL has been designed to be capable of implementation on distributed memory parallel machines such as transputer networks. <#> This paper introduces the core concepts of I-BOL: its view of an image as a set of tuples; user-defined neighbourhood function; and I-BOL 's facilities for recursive image processing. <#> Solutions to a number of example problems illustrate particular aspects of the notation, including the Distance Transform, Histogram Equalization and the Hough Transform. <#> Some consideration is given to the parallel aspects of the current implementation of I-BOL on a pipeline of transputers. <#> A few performance measurements are quoted, giving execution times for the chosen examples on various sizes of transputer work. </p>
 <p> <#> <bold> Keywords: image processing, parallel languages, transputer networks, Image Algebra, recursive image processing </bold> </p>
 <p> <#> The application of parallelism to image processing has for long been recognized as offering considerable benefits. <#> However, published research in this field suggests that most effort has been directed towards the development of parallel architectures and parallel algorithms. <#> With some exceptions, work on software tools such as programming language has been less extensive. <#> This in inevitable, since tool development for any application always lags behind algorithm development, and also since the use of tools can entail a certain loss of performance, particularly in a parallel context. <#> However, as a step towards redressing the balance a little, this paper outlines a language for low level (parallel) image processing which has the aim of improving software productivity while yielding acceptably efficient parallel implementation. </p>
 <p> <#> There is a definite need for tools which will speed up the software development process for parallel systems. <#> This is particularly true of image processing, where it is usually necessary to experiment with different algorithms before determining the best solution. <#> Software development needs to be rapid, but this conflicts with the need for efficient parallel implementations. <#> Programming and evaluating a range of algorithms on, say, a transputer-based parallel system, can be a lengthy and error-prone process because of the need to distribute data and handle interprocessor communication. <#> To speed up software development, the programmer should be relieved of as much of this detail as possible. <#> A suitable programming language is a useful productivity tool, since it can hide the details of the parallel implementation, and enable a programmer to concentrate on the image processing aspects of the problem. <#> General-purpose languages which provide array-processing abstractions for expressing parallelism are becoming available, including Fortran 90 <sp> 1 </sp> and High Performance Fortran <sp> 2 </sp>, and will no doubt be very useful in the development of parallel programs. <#> However, an <it> application-specific </it> language can make certain important assumptions, and choose higher level abstractions, which increase efficiency considerably. <#> This is the approach we have adopted at QUB to language design for image processing. </p>
 <p> <#> One such application-specific programming language for parallel image processing is the APPLY language. <sp> 3 </sp> <#> APPLY was developed and implemented initially on the WARP machine at Carnegie Mellon University, <sp> 4 </sp> as a tool for writing low-level image processing algorithms. <#> <}> <-> Implementation </-> <+> Implementations </+> </}> of it have now been provided for other architectures, including transputer-based machines. <sp> 5 </sp> <#> In an APPLY program, the user writes a procedure which specifies the detailed operations to be performed at one pixel position in the image. <#> The compiler then generates the code which causes the procedure to be applied to every pixel in the image. </p>
 <p> <#> A different approach to APPLY was taken in early work in this field at QUB (Image Algebra Language) and its implementation on a network of transputers. <sp> 6,7 </sp> <#> IAL was based on the abstractions of Image Algebra, a mathematical notation developed at the University of Florida for specifying image processing algorithms. <#> IAL provided operations at the complete image level, with no individual pixel access. <#> For instance, a version of the Sobel edge-finding operator could be coded in IAL as the single statement: <&> equation inserted </&> where S <sp> <it> h </it> </sp> and S <sp> <it> y </sp> </it> are the usual horizontal and vertical Sobel masks (whose weights would previously have been defined), and the operator '<*> asterisk </*> <*> plus sign </*> ' represents convolution. </p>
 <p> <#> IAL proved useful for a range of low level image processing tasks, but was limited in its flexibility and expressive power, partly because it allowed no internal access to individual pixels of an image. <#> Subsequent work to develop a more flexible and powerful notation than IAL has resulted in an extended image processing language, which we called I-BOL. <#> (The name 'I-BOL' sounded appropriate for an image processing mechanism, but exactly what it stands for has yet to be decided!) <#> As well as providing the 'complete image' operations of IAL as a subset, I-BOL permits access to image data at either the pixel or local neighbourhood level without being architecture-specific. </p>
 <p> <#> The design philosophy of I-BOL has been to make parallelism implicit by providing image processing-oriented <it> programming abstraction </it> which are, however, capable of efficient parallel implementation. <#> A key question is how to provide sufficient flexibility without making it impossible for the compiler to produce an efficient parallel implementation. <#> A balance has to be struck between user freedom and the ability to perform automatic parallelization. I-BOL is a step beyond IAL in this direction. </p>
 <p> <#> I-BOL has been implemented on a transputer network. <#> The I-BOL compiler takes a program written in the language, and automatically parallelizes it by distributing the image data. <#> 'Troublesome' features of a parallel implementation, such as interprocessor communication, and the management of borders around image segments, are taken care of by the compiler. <#> The implementation is scalable in the sense that I-BOL programs will run on any number of processors without alteration (except for stating the actual number of processors). </p>
 <p> <#> This paper outlines the main concepts upon which I-BOL is based. <#> In particular, three novel aspects of the language are discussed in more detail: the view of an image as a set of tuples, user-defined neighbourhood functions, and I-BOL 's facilities for recursive image processing. <#> A number of example programs illustrate particular aspects of the notation. <#> These include high level programs for the Distance Transform, Histogram Equalization and the Hough Transform. <#> Some consideration is given to the parallel aspects of the current implementation of I-BOL on transputers. <#> A few performance statistics for the three example programs are then given for executing on transputer networks of size from 4 to 16. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> STANDARD DATA STRUCTURES AND OPERATORS IN I-BOL </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> I-BOL provides a range of built-in types for representing data structures which are commonly used in low-level image processing. <#> The following are the main data types available: <#> <*> bullet point </*> Image type: For storing images (as 2D arrays of pixel) The pixel type can be either <it> integer, real or boolean; </it> <#> <*> bullet point </*> Template type: Windows and weights for local neighbourhood operations (like a small 2D array). Templates can be used for different types of neighbourhood operations; <#> <*> bullet point </*> Vector type: One dimensional array structures (indexed from 0): <#> <*> bullet point </*> A Binaryimage type: A storage-efficient representation of sparse binary images (e.g. edge images). </p>
 <p> <#> The standard data types <it> integer, real </it> and <it> boolean </it> are also provided. <#> As is common in image processing, boolean data is usually compatible with integer arithmetic operations. </p>
 <&> Examples </&>
 <p> <#> As in IAL, the configuration and weights of templates can be defined initially in a <bold> value </bold> section; for instance: <#> <bold> value </bold> </p>
 <&> equation inserted </&>
 <p> <#> Weights in a template can be left undefined (indicated above by '('), in which case they are not included in the computation. <#> Also, a <it> target pixel position </it> must be indicated (within square brackets, like [4] above), for aligning the window with the image during processing. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Operations on complete objects </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> A full range of arithmetic, comparison and local neighbourhood operations is provided to operate on these data structures as indivisible objects. <#> (Operations which explicitly access individual elements of these objects are considered later.) </p>
 <p> <#> These object-level operations fall into the following categories: </p>
 <h> <it> <#> image_operator_image </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Point-to point combination of all corresponding pairs of image pixels, generating an image result. <#> e.g. <&> equation inserted </&>
 <h> <it> <#> image_operator_scalar </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Point-to-point combination of all image pixels with scalar value, generating an image result. <#> (This also covers <it> scalar_operation_image </it> operations).
 <#> e.g. <&> equation inserted </&> </p>
 <h> <it> <#> vector_operator_vector </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Point-to-point combination of all corresponding pairs of vector elements, generating a vector result <#> e.g. <&> equation inserted </&> </p>
 <h> <it> <#> vector_operator_scalar </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Point-to-point combination of all vector elements with a scalar value, generating a vector result. <#> e.g. <&> equation inserted </&> </p>
 <h> <it> <#> image_ operator_template </it> </h>
 <p> <#> The standard set of Image Algebra local neighbourhood operations is provided. <#> These take an image and a template, and produce a result image. <#> The range of operators includes: <&> table inserted </&> <#> e.g. <&> equation inserted </&> </p>
 <h> <it> <#> global image and vector operations </it> </h>
 <p> <#> These operations produce a scalar result, based on an entire image or vector. <#> The global operators include: <#> max <#> min <#> sigma <#> count {applied to boolean image: the number of 'true' pixels} <#> e.g. <&> equation inserted </&> </p>
 <p> <#> A range of built-in functions provides standard mathematical operations on scalars, vectors and images (e.g. float, sin, abs). <#> The standard set of scalar arithmetic and comparison operators is also available. <#> Fuller details of these and other operations can be found elsewhere. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> IMAGES AS SETS: A NOTATION FOR PIXEL ACCESS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> When accessing individual pixels of an image, the conventional view of an image is as a two-dimensional array. <#> The operations involved in processing such a structure are frequently expressed in standard programming languages using single or double loop constructs. <#> With such an approach, programs can become architecture-dependent, since loop constructs may have to be written with a particular architecture or number of processor in mind. </p>
 <p> <#> The I-BOL notation provides an alternative abstraction of an image. <#> It treats an image as a <it> set of tuples, </it> one tuple per pixel. <#> An individual tuple specifies the pixel position and its grey level, and has the form in I-BOL:
 <it> <#> < row, column, grey level at this position > </it> <#> e.g. < i, j, g[i,j]>
 <#> A complete image may be considered as a set of such items, denoted in I-BOL as: <#> { i, j, g[i,j] } </p>
 <p> <#> For instance, <it> Figure 1b </it> shows a tuple set representation of the equivalent simple geometric image in <it> Figure 1a, </it> </p>
 <p> <#> Of course, there is no obligation on an implementation actually to <it> represent </it> such an image in this tuple format behind the scenes (though there might be times when it is useful to do so). <#> But as a programming abstraction for specifying images, it is a convenient standard notation. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Constructing an image as a set </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Forming a new image in I-BOL is a matter of constructing a new set of tuples. I-BOL therefore uses a notation based on the standard method for constructing a set, in which an image can be defined as: <&> table inserted </&> </p>
 <p> <#> This can be written using the I-BOL constructor notation as:
 { i, j, g[i,j] : C1, C2, C3 . . .} </p>
 <p> <#> In this construct, ':' is read as 'such that'. C1, C2 and C3 denote boolean conditions, which must either be true, or be made true during the formation of the set (i.e. a condition can either <it> qualify </it> a potential member, or <it> generate </it> potential members). <#> A condition may be made 'true' by appropriate instantiation of variables within it. <#> Thus the above constructor could be read as:
 <it> ""Find all substituations for i, j and g[i, j] such that C1, C2 and C3 are true"" </it> </p>
 <p> <#> This structure is called an <it> image constructor </it>. <#> Syntactically, it is an expression. <#> For instance: <&> equation inserted </&> </p>
 <p> <#> This will construct an image <it> Image1 </it> in which the grey level of each pixel corresponds to the pixel's distance from the top left hand corner of the image. <#> The bounds for i and j are implicitly defined by the declared bounds of Image1. <#> Note that the condition imposes no constraint on the coordinates i and j. <#> In general, for assignment to an image declared in the normal way, the tuples are defined over the declared space, and the conditions are used to calculate the grey level. <#> For any position for which the conditions fail, an appropriate default grey level is defined for that position: 0 for interger images, 0.0 for real, and <it> false </it> for boolean. <#> Thus, a boolean image which could be used to implement an ideal filter, comprising just those pixels within a radius R of the centre (X <sb> 0 </sb>, Y <sb> 0 </sb>), could be constructed as: <&> equation inserted </&> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Vectors as sets </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In a similar way to images, a one-dimensional vector can be viewed as a set of tuples. <#> For convenience, the index of a tuple in a vector is implicit, and can be deduced from the subscript in the data value. <#> Thus a vector is written as a set of indexed values, as in: <#> { v[i] } <#> A vector can be constructed using the constructor notation, as in, for instance: <&> equation inserted </&> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Pixel referencing </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> I-BOL provides restricted access to the internal components of an existing image (or a vector) in several ways, but only ever within an image constructor. <#> When constructing a set of pixels whose positions are specified in the constructor as <i, j> , it is possible to reference the following sub-components of an image:
 <p> <#> (i) all individual pixels of an image, whose positions are normally specified relative to <i, j> ; <#> (ii) all local neighbourhoods, or <it> patches </it> , within an existing image, i.e. all subsets of pixels within a specified region relative to <i,j> . <#> These patches will be overlapping. <#> Apart from on the outside boundaries, there will be one patch for very pixel position; <#> (iii) all non-overlapping patches, called <it> tiles </it>. <#> The number of tiles is obviously less than the number of pixels by a factor of the tile size: <#> (iv) I-BOL does allow unrestricted access to any pixel, but the implementation is likely to impose restrictions of the range of pixel positions. In a parallel implementation on a distributed memory machine, for instance, it is likely that efficient random access is guaranteed only within neighbourhoods; the restrictions on non-neighbourhood access depend on the image distribution strategy. </p>

IrishEnglish,can,"While the deference can irk - ""Sir"" - the guy who served me in Nashville 's brilliant Hard Rock Cafe was just magic in terms of the routine care and attention he lavished on me",epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,<W2B-007$A>,"
 <h> <#> There 's no sign of our Daniel O'Donnell in Nashville, the country music capital of the world, writes <bold> Harry Ferguson </h>
 <h> <#> Kitsch and country </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> A COUPLE of days into my trip to Nashville I began to feel uncomfortable. <#> The more I got the feel for the place and came to understand that there are only three important things to Nashville as a location - country music, country music, and country music - the more I was beset with a sense of existential angst; that something was missing. <#> It was Daniel O'Donnell. <#> More to the point, it was the <it> absence </it> of Daniel that shocked. <#> Not a sign of him anywhere in the Country capital of the world. <#> Some four years after the music business re-classified his records as not country, here I was having to confront headon my denial of the tragedy of what they did to Daniel. </p>
 <p> <#> While the Country Music Hall of Fame minus Daniel seems a contradiction in terms, it is superb; a real treasure. <#> As well as featuring today 's stars - Garth Brooks and co - it is a veritable journey into the stars of one 's childhood, with original outfits, cowboy boots, instruments, original records and other trinkets that were adorned by the likes of Roy Rogers, Johnny Cash, Jim Reeves, Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris. <#> There 's even Elvis Presley 's very own 'Solid Gold' 1960 Cadillac which was his favourite. </p>
 <p> <#> The symbiotic relationship between Nashville and country music all began when the Grand Ole Opry Theatre opened in the 1920s and established itself as the country venue. <#> While the original theatre is still there in Downtown Nashville and worth a visit, today 's Opry has been relocated to a site some 20 miles outside of the City which is disappointingly hard to reach without a car. </p>
 <p> <#> There were other compensations for Daniel 's absence. <#> Like meeting Willis Gupton, who informed me that when he was four years old his <quote> ""daddy, who was a bluegrass picker,"" </quote> gave him his first guitar. <#> Willis 's promotional literature refers to his <quote> ""no nonsense approach [as] refreshing, exciting, and a rare breed especially in today 's spit and polish, New York/LA style of country music that has invaded Nashville. <#> You can't help but love this guy 's honesty, and sense of good ol' fashioned country humour ... Get off that couch and give Willis Gupton a spin! <#> He 'll do more for ya than 14 cups of strong black coffee."" </quote> <#> Howl me back!! </p>
 <p> <#> <quote> ""Invade Nashville"" </quote> - now why didn't Daniel think of <it> that? </it> <#> Willis gave me a promo' copy of his debut single, 'Bringing Home The Bacon', and - in that typically pathetic post-colonial low self-esteem Oirish way of not being able to take something for nothing - I assured him that there could well be a spot waiting for him on <it> Kenny Live. </it> <#> God knows it feels like just about everyone else from Nashville has been on it. </p>
 <p> <#> The naked ambition of the endless stream of wannabees is just one of the eerie pleasures of Nashville. <#> Even the buskers have cut CDs. <#> I bought one for <*> dollar sign </*> 10 off a guy called Jeff Paz who was singing his heart out on the street accompanied by a very sophisticated canned soundtrack. <#> He autographed it for me with such sincerity and earnestness that the likes of Willis and Jeff make Daniel seem <it> mean. </it> </p>
 <p> <#> Garth Brooks is the superstar ideal they 're all dreaming of. <#> When you visit the ""Garth Store"" in Downtown Nashville, you can see why. <#> This guy is even richer than Daniel O'Donnell, and possibly even nicer. <#> If you don't believe me, Pat Kenny seems to think so, and he 's met them both. <#> So there. </p>
 <p> <#> America never fails to fascinate, and so a visit to Nashville enables one to absorb the general horrors and delights of this extraordinary country. <#> The obsession with food - it 's everywhere. <#> The wonderful customer service. <#> While the deference can irk - ""Sir"" - the guy who served me in Nashville 's brilliant Hard Rock Cafe was just magic in terms of the routine care and attention he lavished on me. </p>
 <p> <#> And who cares anymore if they don't <it> really </it> give a damn whether or not you <quote> ""have a nice day!"" </quote> <#> I 'd prefer it anyday to the feeling of being ignored and a nuisance that can be served up in some Irish businesses. <#> Then there 's the television - travel always gives a new perspective on our own national passions - and if Diarmuid Doyle thinks RTE is bad, jaysus he should sit through a few days of trash they call American TV. <#> If they 'd only make those confessional talk-shows <it> <&Irish> as Gaeilge! </&Irish> </it> <#> Or perhaps not. </p>
 <p> <#> Yet, on its own terms, Nashville has to go down as one of the USA 's most superficially boring cities. <#> Not only does it lack the in-your-face dynamism and culture of a New York or a San Francisco, it looks for the most part like a dump. <#> Give it half a chance though and - not unlike Daniel himself - it grows on you. <#> The cowboy boot and hat shops are a delight - boots of all shapes and sizes and Stetsons as far as the eye can see. <#> You can even buy a pair of cowboy golf boots - studs and all! </p>
 <p> <#> Nashville is the nerve centre of the religious publishing industry of the States. <#> The gigantic shops make our own Veritas look, well, small. <#> In the Baptist shop, for instance, you can buy books on every aspect of the human condition - with the exception of homosexuality, of course (see elsewhere under sexual perversions and the devil). </p>
 <p> <#> My own favourite was the section on masculinity and the family which included titles such as <it> Boys: Shaping Ordinary Boys into Extraordinary Men </it> by William Beausay II (what I want to know is just how did Mr and Mrs O'Donnell get a hold of that book in Donegal and so long ago?), <it> Boys to Men: How Fathers Can Help Build Character in Their Sons, </it> by Steve Lee, Ed D and Chap Clark. <#> The authors of these books, and others in the 'Men of Integrity' series, are pictured on the dust-jackets complete with their much heralded Ed D 's and looking even cleaner than Daniel - which is hard to believe I know, but understandable I suppose given the number of times they 've been baptised. </p>
 <p> <#> The religious revival in the States is quite something. <#> There are over 80 Baptist Churches within that single denomination alone in the greater Nashville area (the State of Tennessee has literally hundreds). <#> Just one of these churches holds 4,000 and has a congregation of 6,000. <#> They have two services on a Sunday, some 20 pastors, and a nightmare organising the car-parking. </p>
 <p> <#> Nashville, I learned, is the kitsch capital of the States - Junk City USA. <#> <}> <-> the </-> <+> The </+> </}> knickknack and memorabilia shops are just packed full of the most naff range of merchandise imaginable; enough to make my Daniel O'Donnell mugs and calendar seem sophisticated, part of high culture. <#> Inevitably perhaps, as nostalgia isn't what it used to be, Elvis memorabilia looms large - even if he is a Memphis boy. </p>
 <p> <#> A very well organised tour of the Music City neighbourhood, where all the big stars have their agents, record companies their administrative headquarters and the big recording deals are struck etc, culminates in a visit to RCA 's Studio B. <#> The highlight was a guide who clearly loves The King, identifying with such relish the very spot where Elvis stood to record some of his great albums. </p>
 <p> <#> Ultimately, Music City USA really comes into its own after dark. <#> The competitive environment of the music business is such that the standard of fun-of-the-mill acts in bars and clubs is extraordinarily high and fabulous value as most have no cover-charge. </p>
 <p> <#> A visit to the Wild Horse Saloon for the Line-Dancing is a must. <#> These cowgirls and boys (real men <it> do </it> line-dance, it seems) sure know how to move in majestic ways. <#> They 'll even let you join in, although beware as those involved in the sessions for so-called beginners seemed frighteningly co-ordinated and twinkly-toed to this wrong-footed eejit. <#> Hardly surprising, perhaps, as I never could quite master jiving. </p>
 <p> <#> And speaking of jiving, Daniel, you 're as well out of it ... But watch out for yer man Willis Gupton, ""invading Ireland"" and creeping up your inside. </p>

IrishEnglish,should,"Hinge bolts also serve to boost door security and are especially useful on doors with exposed hinges, offering protection even should the hinges themselves be removed",epistemic,epistemic,deontic,<W2D-018$A>,"
 <h> <bold> <#> Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This booklet is intended to provide you with some basic information on HOME PROTECTION. <#> We know that your home is very special to you, as the place where you feel safest and most relaxed. <#> It also contains some very valuable property, if not in a commercial sense, then certainly in terms of its sentimental worth. <#> There is no insurance policy which could compensate you adequately for the loss and upset which can result from a burglary. <#> That 's why you should minimise the risk of having your home broken into, and the contents stolen. </p>
 <p> <#> There are some very simple steps you can take, which will help improve the physical security of your home, and allay some of your fears. <#> Many of these will cost you nothing more than a few moments of your time. <#> Other measures may be more expensive, and may range in price from several pounds to several hundred pounds - but we 'll have a look at some of these later on. <#> It 's best to begin with the most obvious and easiest steps. </p>
 <p> <#> As a starting point for considering the safety of <}> <-> you </-> <+> your </+> </}> home, let 's look at it from the burglar 's point of view. <#> What type of signs would help him target your home? </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Signs of vacancy </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Burglars tend to be skilled in recognizing signs which indicate that a particular house is vacant. <#> This means that it is unlikely that they will be disturbed on entry and helps to explain why 80 <*> per cent sign </*> of burglaries take place in unoccupied homes. </p>
 <p> <#> The following are some of the things a burglar looks for: <#> A build-up of milk on the door-step <#> A build-up of papers and advertisements in the letter box
 <#> A build-up of letters in the hall visible from outside <#> Blinds pulled down, or curtains across during the day <#> No lights on at night, or just 'dead' lights like in the porch, or the hall <#> Lights on during the day <#> Front gates closed and no car in the drive way <#> Notes left for delivery men or callers <#> Uncut lawn and untidy garden </p>
 <p> <#> Obviously any of these occurring by itself does not confirm that the premises are unoccupied. <#> But they are some of the criteria thieves use to target their victims. <#> There more signs there are, the more certain they can be that nobody is at home. </p>
 <p> <#> These tell-tale signs can be easily avoided by a little personal care and attention. <#> If you live in a neighbourhood Watch Area, it is likely that you and your neighbour will already have developed a greater awareness of the need to take such precautions. <#> If you are not a member, why not make some enquiries about the advantages of this crime prevention programme. </p>
 <p> <#> Modern technology can also be of assistance in quite inexpensive ways. <#> For example, you can purchase a time switch quite cheaply and use this to turn on and off lights automatically at the appropriate times. <#> It can also be used to control radios and televisions to simulate that someone is present in the house; but do make sure that you follow the manufacturer 's recommendations and don't compromise your fire safety. </p>
 <p> <#> An outside light, especially at the rear of the building can also act as a deterrent - burglars certainly don't want to be seen. <#> This may go against your natural desire for privacy, which may also require fences and hedges. <#> Sometimes there can be a trade-off between privacy and security, with the 'happy medium' being a matter of personal choice. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> An open invitation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> After you have eliminated any clear indications of unoccupancy, the next step is to make sure that you do not invite the burglar in through carelessness. <#> Most burglars are opportunists and will select the easiest target that they can find. </p>
 <p> <#> Don't offer him assistance by: <#> Leaving any window open. <#> Some people do this for ventilation forgetting that burglars will take advantage of the smallest opening. <#> Leaving external doors unlocked. <#> Leaving a key on a string, under a door-mat, or in some other 'good hiding place' outside. <#> Failing to secure side doors, allowing entry to the back of the premises which is more vulnerable to attack. <#> Failing to keep garages and sheds locked. <#> Not only do they contain valuable property, but also tools which may help the burglar to gain access to your home. </p>
 <p> <#> Also make sure that ladders are not left in the open, or in insecure positions. <#> In most circumstances the thief will tend not to carry tools, or equipment with him for fear of detection. <#> Don't make his job any easier by providing them at the 'site'. </p>
 <p> <#> Simply by taking these straight forward crime prevention measures brings you well on the road to achieving greater household security. <#> These measures alone will decrease the likelihood that you will be the burglar 's next victim. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Keeping the intruder out </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> There is still more that you can do to improve your security. <#> At this stage you have reached a point where any would be burglar can only gain entry by physically breaking into your home. <#> In many cases he can be deterred from doing this by the proper use of locks and bolts. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> WINDOWS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Windows form a popular entry point for burglars, and it has been estimated that more than two thirds gain entry in this way. <#> The risk partly depends on two factors. <#> The first is how accessible the window is, and the second is how clearly visible the window is to your neighbours and passers-by. <#> Therefore, those windows at the rear and side of the building, which can be easily reached from the ground, or via pipes, or adjoining roofs are most vulnerable. </p>
 <p> <#> Obviously windows which have not been left open must be broken, or prised to allow the burglar to put his hand through to release any catch or fitting. <#> If window locks are fitted, his task is so much more difficult. <#> This may force him to smash an area large enough to climb through. <#> Breaking glass may attract attention and few burglars will want to risk it. </p>
 <p> <#> Furthermore, do remember not to leave the keys to the window locks where they can be seen, or are within easy reach. <#> The style of the window can also have a bearing on vulnerability. <#> For example, certain types of louvre windows are particularly risky wherein the glass panels can easily be removed. </p>
 <p> <#> Various types of window locking devices are displayed below.. <#> You should choose a lock which is suitable to your window, whether it is a sash window, a french window, <}> <-> of </-> <+> or </+> </}> whether it is wooden or metal framed. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> DOORS </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Doors, particularly those at the side and rear of the dwelling are also likely entry points. <#> Consequently, they require special attention. <#> It is also important to consider any door which gives access to these sites, including garage doors. <#> Many of the better quality locks will give extra protection against attacks from <}> <-> jemmys' </-> <+> jemmies </+> </}> , crowbars, hand-drills and picks - some of the favourite tools of the burglar. <#> On the other hand, many outside doors are still being fitted with a type of lock which can be slipped open with a piece of plastic. </p>
 <p> <#> Displayed....are two types of locks which are commonly found on external front doors. <#> A rim lock <}> <-> and </-> </}> is attached to the surface of the door. <#> A mortice lock which is superior. </p>
 <p> <#> We recommend that as a minimum precaution all external doors are fitted with the five lever mortice lock. <#> In this case, the lock is actually recessed into the door itself, as can be seen from the drawing. <#> Door leaf should be at least 44mm in thickness to allow adequate strength after <}> <-> mortise </-> <+> mortice </+> </}> lock has been fitted. </p>
 <p> <#> Mortice security bolts serve a similar purpose and can be used independently, or to augment existing security arrangements. <#> Hinge bolts also serve to boost door security and are especially useful on doors with exposed hinges, offering protection even should the hinges themselves be removed. </p>
 <p> <#> The quality of the door and the materials used, will also <}> <-> effect </-> <+> affect </+> </}> its strength against attack. <#> If the design of the door is weak, then it will be difficult to compensate for this by using high security lock. <#> For example, hollow doors are not suitable for external fittings, and should be confined to internal use only. </p>
 <p> <#> Besides the illustrations of some typical door locks, currently on the market, we have included door limiters. <#> These provide some security when you are at home by helping you to control access. <#> You should also consider fitting a door viewer. <#> This will enable you to identify the caller without having to open the door. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> FIREARMS <*> ampersand </*> AMMUNITION </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> If you are the holder of licensed firearms, or ammunition, you should take special precautions to ensure their safety. <#> A steel gun locker is a worthwhile purchase which will afford a high level of security and give a life-time 's service. <#> If you don't have one of these then keep the firearm and ammunition separately, and remove the firing mechanism and magazine. <#> This will prevent the easy unlawful use of the weapon, not only by criminals but also by inquisitive children. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> OTHER PROPERTY </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Whatever the nature of your property, be sure that you have an adequate record of it and that, where possible, it is also marked with your own property number. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> RECORDING PROPERTY </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The benefits of marking property are that: <#> It greatly increases the likelihood of stolen property being returned to the owner. <#> As you probably already know, a great deal of property remains unclaimed in Garda possession as the owners cannot be identified. <#> It will make the property less attractive to the thief. <#> He will not be able to readily dispose of property that is marked and can be easily identified. <#> Generally, he will not want to steal goods that he cannot resell. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Inside the house </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> When you are away from home, we recommend that you normally should not lock weak internal doors. <#> They offer very little resistance and may result in unnecessary damage. <#> If the intruder has gained access it is unlikely that these will prove realistic deterrents. <#> For similar reasons it is also felt that cupboards and bureaus should not be locked. <#> Moreover, in no circumstances should these ever be considered as providing sufficient protection for your valuables. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> CASH </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In the first instance, you should limit the amount of cash left in the home. <#> Don't leave money in dishes or jars in anticipation of paying some bill. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> JEWELLERY </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> All jewellery should be locked out of sight when you are not at home - either in a small floor safe or some similar protective casing. <#> You could just as easily protect it by leaving it with a relative or friend, particularly if you intend to be away for some time. <#> Some banks also offer this holding facility. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> BICYCLES </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Bicycles are very valuable items of property <}> <-> some times </-> <+> sometimes </+> </}> carelessly left around the house. <#> Once off the street there is a tendency to forget the danger from thieves. <#> However, many bicycles are stolen from backyards and side passages. <#> Always have your bicycle locked when not in use. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> PROPERTY MARKING NUMBER </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> A property marking number is simply a specific number used to identify your property. <#> We recommend that you use your date of birth as initials, for example: </p>
 <p> <#> If your name is John A. Dunne, born on the 13/11/43, then your property number would be 131143 JAD. <#> You put this number on all appropriate items of your property, using one of the methods outlined below. <#> You then fill out a card with this information, and return it to your local Garda Station.</p>
 <p> <#> The items which should be marked are those most likely to be stolen, especially portable electrical and mechanical goods. <#> In the event of property being stolen and later recovered, the Gardai will have no trouble in matching the property with its rightful owners. </p>

 <h> <#> Why Devolution? </h>
 <h> <#> Paul R. Maguire </h>
 <p> <#> The story of how devolution came to Northern Ireland in 1920 and how it operated during the period 1920-72 has been told many times. <sp> 1 </sp> <#> It remains relevant and instructive. <#> For our purposes, two essential points from it may be repeated here. <#> First, devolution to Northern Ireland arose out of a historical fluke. <#> Neither unionists nor nationalists in Ireland wanted it; on the contrary, they wanted to avoid it. <#> Unionist concern was to resist 'home rule' for Ireland as a whole and particularly to prevent the province falling within the jurisdiction of a Dublin home-rule parliament. <#> Nationalists wanted home rule for the island but for them any talk of the partition of Ireland and separate institutions in the North was anathema. <#> Wanting to grant home rule to Ireland but being driven by unionist pressure to exclude the North-East of the island from it, the British government legislated for devolution to both North and South, each area with its separate institutions. <#> As Buckland has said of the legislation: <quote> 'The Act was basically a device adopted by the British government and Parliament anxious to get rid of the Irish Question and yet obliged to redeem pledges to Ulster unionists'. <quote> <sp> 2 </sp> <#> The proposed institutions only took root in Northern Ireland, Southern Ireland soon becoming a Dominion and later a Republic. </p>
 <p> <#> Second, the operation of devolution in Northern Ireland ended in failure. <#> At the worst of times, the unionist majority in the province governed in its own interest and to the detriment of the minority. <#> At the best of times, the devolved institutions lacked the political consensus across the historical community divide to sustain them. <#> For over fifty years, allegations of discrimination and bias against, and repression of, the minority were widespread, and many of these allegations were justified. <#> When a civil rights movement to redress minority grievances led on to inter-communal violence, this resulted in the deployment of the British Army, in aid of the civil power, in 1969. <#> The slumbering national government was woken up. <#> By 1972 London 's need to control security in the province meant that it had to ask the government of Northern Ireland to agree to powers in this sphere, which legally were vested in the devolved authority, being returned to the centre. <#> When the devolved authority refused to accept this and resigned, the British government, exercising its undoubted legal right, prorogued the Parliament of Northern Ireland and ended devolution. <#> Direct rule of Northern Ireland by Westminster began. <#> Devolution for Northern Ireland at this point looked dead and buried, and few would have thought that after 1972 there would be any sustained interest in it. <#> Expectations pointed away from devolution. <#> Unionists would surely find nothing more acceptable than rule from Westminster? <#> Similarly, one might have expected nationalists to prefer London to Belfast rule: surely the latter would be the last thing they would want? <#> And to the British government, the responsible power internationally accountable for the calamitous situation in Northern Ireland, the idea of entrusting power again to provincial politicians cannot, it might have been thought, have had much appeal. <#> Yet the focus of political debate about the future government of Northern Ireland since then has not substantially centred on forms of government from the centre. <#> Instead, much of the time, it has been directed to the restoration of devolution. <#> Time after time the body has been exhumed and attempts made to breathe life into it. <#> Why? <#> What are the arguments being deployed to support a return to devolution? <#> In this chapter, after considering the demand for devolution, it is proposed to identify and consider these arguments. <#> The purpose is not to pass judgement on the future viability of devolution; rather, it is to seek to explain why it is desired. <#> Understanding the latter may, it is hoped, provide a foundation for conclusions concerning the former. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> The demand for devolution since 1972 </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The stance of three main groups needs to be considered in the assessment of the demand for devolution: the British government; the Irish government; and the political parties in Northern Ireland. </p>
 <p> <#> As far as the first is concerned, it is clear that a policy of redevolving power to institutions in Northern Ireland has held sway. <#> That this is so is evident from a series of papers published on the future government of Northern Ireland in 1972, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1980 and 1982.<sp> 3 </sp> <#> Moreover, the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed in 1985 records the British government 's support for devolution in Northern Ireland on a basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community. <#> At the time of writing (mid-1991), the Secretary of State has obtained the agreement of relevant other parties to the establishment of formal talks whose aim, <it> inter alia </it> , is to arrive at a situation in which devolved power could again be transferred to regional institutions. </p>
 <p> <#> As regards the Irish government, it is probably correct to say that its approach has varied from time to time. <#> Three periods are worth distinguishing: 1972-9, 1979-85, and 1985 to the present time. <#> In the first of these, Irish governments of all political shades supported a policy which had two limbs to it: first, the establishment of a partnership or power-sharing devolved system in Northern Ireland in which the traditional minority would have a full part to play; and second, the creation of an appropriate institutional recognition of what that that time was referred to as 'the Irish dimension'. <#> Consequent to this broad policy, both Irish government and opposition were in support of the power-sharing and Sunningdale package put together in 1973, with devolved power actually being transferred at the beginning of 1974. <#> When the package came apart in mid-1974, Irish government policy was directed to re-establishing a similar arrangement and this remained the case until the election of Charles Haughey as Fianna F&/ail leader and Taoiseach in 1979. <#> From then until 1985 interest in Northern devolution waned. <#> The emphasis was placed instead on Anglo-Irish intergovernmental structures, a process begun by Haughey and continued by Garret FitzGerald when he was Taoiseach. <#> While this approach faltered because of the Falklands war, and while for a period the field was occupied by the New Ireland Forum which had nothing to say about this idea of devolution to Northern Ireland - its conclusions supporting a series of more or less nationalist options - by 1985 the intergovernmental strategy was back on course, leading in November to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. <#> Though initially rejected by Fianna F&/ail, which were then in opposition, the Agreement has represented Irish Government policy since, despite the return of Fianna F&/ail to power in 1987. <#> In its terms, the Agreement commits the Irish government to support devolution for Northern Ireland, albeit devolution within the context established by the Agreement itself. <#> The strength of that commitment, however, is open to debate. <#> At the time of writing, a gap is proposed in the meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to enable talks between relevant parties to proceed with the aim mentioned earlier. </p>
 <p> <#> The attitudes of the political parties in Northern Ireland can broadly be seen by reference to manifestos or position papers at times of inter-party negotiation or discussion, that is, in 1972-3, 1975-6, 1980, and 1982-6. <#> Inevitably there have, over time, been some changes in the composition of the 'constitutional' political spectrum <sp> 4 </sp> but, notwithstanding these, it is possible to distinguish four main groups: the Democratic Unionists (DUP); the Official Unionists (OUP); the Alliance Party; and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). </p>
 <p> <#> The position of the DUP after the breakdown of devolved government in 1972 was that <quote> 'Northern Ireland should cease to have any separate legislature or executive of its own, but be fully integrated with the rest of the United Kingdom'. </quote> <#> But by 1975 this position had altered. <#> Since then, either as part of a unionist coalition or in its own right, the DUP has consistently and vigorously argued for devolution. </p>
 <p> <#> In contrast, while the OUP strongly supported redevolution in 1972 and, as part of a unionist coalition, in 1975, after this it became ambivalent, some of the leading spokesmen adhering to a policy of devolution, some advocating only a very weak form of devolution, and others, led by Enoch Powell, calling for integration. <#> Since 1986 OUP support for devolution has been intermittent, though an OUP representative, Jack Allen, appears to have been in favour of it at the Duisburg talks, an informal gathering of representatives from Northern Ireland 's political parties held in Germany in 1989, and, more recently, the party has indicated its willingness to participate in the Secretary of State 's proposed discussions, referred to earlier. </p>
 <p> <#> The Alliance Party has consistently adhered to a policy of redevolution, as is clear from its submissions to the Darlington Conference held in September 1972 (which three out of seven local parties invited by the Secretary of State attended), its participation in the power-sharing executive in 1974, its manifesto for the Convention election in 1975, its participation in the Convention in 1975-6, its submission to the Atkins inter-party talks in 1980, and its involvement in the 1982-6 Assembly. <#> After 1986 it also published its proposals for the future, which centred on devolution. </p>
 <p> <#> Finally, the SDLP position has progressed on lines not dissimilar to those along which the Irish government 's thinking has progressed. <#> While the language used in 1972 was that of the creation of an interim system of government for Northern Ireland in which there would be an Assembly and Executive drawn from it, under the joint responsibility of the British and Irish governments, the party was actively involved in the power-sharing Executive in 1974 and was a supporter of the Sunningdale package. <#> In 1975 its manifesto for the Convention election proposed the establishment of <quote> 'a powerful and representative Northern Ireland Assembly' </quote> and an administration in which both sections of the community could participate to the full. <#> It also sought recognition of both Irish and British dimensions. <#> After initial hesitation, the party did take part in the Atkins conference, but only on condition that there be discussions with the Secretary of State to deal with arrangements for an Irish dimension to any agreed partnership form of devolution. <#> In 1982 the SDLP decided to contest the election to the proposed Assembly but not to take any seats, if elected. <#> This was because it considered unworkable the rolling devolution proposal legislated for in the Northern Ireland Act 1982, and, in any event, as far as the party was concerned the plan lacked a sufficient Irish dimension. <#> Instead of going to the Assembly the SDLP became involved in the proceedings of the New Ireland Forum, which sat for the first time on 30 May 1983 and reported on 2 May 1984. <#> As would be expected, the SDLP supported the Anglo-Irish Agreement. <#> Since 1985 there has been interest in the SDLP in devolution within the framework of the Agreement or a suitable Anglo-Irish agreement to supersede it. <#> The SDLP has agreed to enter the formal inter-party talks noted earlier. </p>
 <p> <#> Overall, it may be concluded that the concept of devolution has played a significant part in the thinking of all the groups concerned at some time, if not throughout the period under review. <#> What, of course, has been lacking has been agreement both on the ways in which minority rights are to be safeguarded in the internal operation of devolution and on the relationships between the devolved institutions and the two governments involved. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> The arguments for devolution </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In discussing the arguments addressed in favour of devolution, reliance has been placed mainly, but not exclusively, on the stances adopted by the relevant parties: not exclusively, because it is necessary at times to seek to interpret party postures. <#> This is so because very often what parties state is the form of devolution they desire, and only in passing do they state their reasons for preferring a devolutionary model in the first place. <#> Why this is so is itself interesting. <#> The assumption must be that either the parties themselves have not addressed, head-on at any rate, the question why there should be devolution, or they regard candour in this respect, for reasons perhaps related to negotiation, as unnecessary or even counter-productive. <#> Whatever the reason, the result is that in what follows lines of argument may be exposed which are implicit rather than explicit in their thinking. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Anthropologist, George Devereux has stated that <quote> ""...abortion is an absolutely universal phenomenon."" </quote> <sp> 1 </sp> <#> It is a phenomenon which has sparked off one of the most contentious and durable debates in the history of law and ethics, because of the inherent gravity of the issues involved and the depth of feeling which it evokes. <#> Attitudes to abortion are shaped, to a large extent, by the general <quote> ""cultural climate"" </quote> within which they are made - often reactions to the questions raised by the issue arise from <}> <-> peoples ' </-> <+> people 's </+> </}> unconscious axioms and collective feelings, rather than from any entirely rational or conscious deliberation on the subject. <#> Virtually every legal system in virtually every time has criminalized abortion in some very limited circumstances and allowed it in other circumstances. <#> There is no absolutist legal system and no legal system with no regulation. <#> Basically the means employed to deal with abortion depends on how the question is actually defined: is it a moral, social or political issue, and this is intrinsically linked with the society 's conception of the individual and the world. <#> Petersen <sp> 2 </sp> suggests that it is possible to construct a typology which recognises three distinct models of abortion laws, all dealing with regulation in different ways: <#> 1. The <it> Abortion Reform </it> model <#> 2. The <it> Judicial model </it> , and <#> 3. The <it> Elective </it> model. </p>
 <p> <#> These models provide a useful means of comparative analysis and so, it is proposed in this paper to examine the abortion laws of three countries: England, Northern Ireland and Denmark, each of which corresponds to one. <#> The three models will be outlined, followed by a description of the laws in the three countries. <#> An analysis will ensue in which a comparative approach will be adopted, in order to assess the transferability of the law of abortion. <#> Finally, some general conclusions will be drawn about the methods of regulation employed in the three jurisdictions examined, and what lessons can be learnt from the different experiences. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> The Abortion Reform Model </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In countries where abortion law corresponds to this model, original criminal statutes have been altered by legislatures to provide for lawful abortion when a medical practitioner honestly believes that justifiable grounds exist. <#> This model preserves the essential right of medical practitioners to autonomy, however various conditions place some restriction on the clinical freedom of medical practitioners. <#> As we shall see, the law in England is an example of the abortion reform mode. </p>
 <p> <#> Abortion was largely dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts until the beginning of the nineteenth century when abortion after quickening became regarded as a common law offence. <sp> 3 </sp> <#> In 1803 all abortion was criminalized with punishment for postquickening abortion being set at death. <#> However, both the concept of quickening and punishment with death was eliminated from the abortion equation in 1838. <#> The basis for these early laws is not clear. <sp> 4 </sp> </p>
 <p> <#> The 1861 <it> Offences Against the Persons Act </it> is taken by most writers as the staring point for the understanding of the modern law regarding abortion. <#> Section 58 made it a statutory offence to procure a miscarriage by administering drugs or using instruments. <sp> 5 </sp> <#> Section 59 made it an offence to supply or procure any poison or other noxious thing or any instrument or thing, knowing it is intended to be unlawfully used with intent to procure a miscarriage. <#> The legislation which made a woman or a doctor potentially liable to life imprisonment for performing an abortion even when the woman 's life and health were threatened by continuing the pregnancy, resulted in many backstreet abortions and the loss of the lives of many potential mothers. <#> In the 1920s, there were a series of cases where babies were strangled using the umbilical cords which still attached them to their mothers. <#> Women and doctors were prosecuted for infanticide but acquitted because of a gap which existed in the law. <#> This gap meant that it was possible to avoid criminal liability by killing a child in the course of normal birth but before it was fully born and the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 was enacted to plug this <sp> 6 </sp> . <#> A defence was provided by the Act if the act causing the death was done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother. <#> The Act also contained a time limit: evidence that a woman had been pregnant for a period of 28 weeks or more, should be prima facie proof that the child was capable of being born alive and this was later read into the OAPA. </p>
 <p> <#> However the availability of abortion was not as restricted in practice as it was on paper. <#> The reason for this was the case of <it> R v Bourne </it> <sp> 7 </sp> . <#> Many doctors were unhappy with the state of the law regarding abortions and considered it too restrictive. </p>
 <p> <#> Eventually one doctor, Aleck Bourne, a consultant obstetrician, performed an abortion on a fourteen year old victim of a brutal multiple rape committed by two soldiers. <#> He then invited the police to arrest him and the Attorney General decided to prosecute. <#> In his direction to the jury, MacNaghten J. advised that a broad interpretation as to the meaning of <quote> ""preserving the life of the mother"" </quote> should be adopted: </p>
 <p> <#> Thus, explicit judicial approval was given to the exercise of medical discretion for therapeutic termination. <#> <it> R v Bergmann and Ferguson </it> <sp> 9 </sp> and <it> R v Newton and Stungo </it> <sp> 10 </sp> clarified the position that, as long as the doctor acted in good faith, therapeutic abortion was legal. </p>
 <p> <#> However, this did not eradicate the practice of backstreet abortions. <#> The real desire to reduce backstreet abortions, thus reducing maternal mortality, by providing a more sympathetic system for women, was the main factor influencing the reform of abortion law which occurred in 1967 under the Abortion Act. <#> Other influencing factors were the need to protect the autonomy of the medical profession and to stamp out the fear of prosecution, which existed even despite the fact that there was very little real risk of prosecution of a qualified medical practitioner who performed abortions, as long as he or she acted in conformity with recognized medical procedure. <#> For the medical profession, the law remained both fragile and ambiguous: fragile in that the <it> Bourne </it> decision was made in a lower court and so could be overruled, and ambiguous in that the criteria of <quote> ""good faith"" </quote> and <quote> ""honest opinion"" </quote> were tenuously subjective. </p>
 <p> <#> The Abortion Act 1967, received royal assent after a series of attempts to change the law. <#> It was decided that the best strategy for getting the private members bill through Parliament would be to stitch new law on to existing law. <#> Thus the Act took as its starting point, the defences to the 1861 Act and reiterated the time limit of the 1929 Act. <#> The Act is considered to provide four grounds for legal abortion - where there is: <#> 1. a risk to the life of the woman <#> 2. a risk to the physical or mental health of the woman <#> 3. a risk of injury to the physical or mental health of existing children of the woman <#> 4. substantial risk of serious handicap </p>
 <p> <#> The third ground provides the most room for manoeuvre - Feldman states that <quote> ""the freedom given to doctors to take account of environmental matters gave a discretion to allow something like abortion on demand"" </quote>. <sp> 11 </sp> <#> The Abortion Act has been amended by the <it> Human Fertilization and Embryology Act </it> 1990, section 5 of which established the Human Fertilization and Embryology authority to review information concerning embryos. <#> The Act provides specific grounds for abortion, and these are set out in s.1 (1) (a), (b), (c), (d) and 1(4) of the act.<sp> 12 </sp> <#> Abortions certified under s. 1(1)(a) must be carried out by the end of the 24 <sp> th </sp> week of pregnancy. <#> There is no time limit at all for abortions based on the other grounds - anti-abortionists ironically failed to prevent the House of Commons from removing the 28-week presumption in respect of handicapped foetuses, because they were so intent on reducing the limit for abortions under s.1(1)(a). </p>
 <p> <#> The other sections are really only consolidations of the law as it stands - however the new section 1(d) is a significant liberalization of the law -: where there is a <quote> ""substantial risk"" </quote> of physical or mental abnormalities as to be <quote> ""seriously handicapped"" </quote> , an abortion will be permissible up to the point of birth. <#> It is unclear what exactly is meant by <quote> ""substantial risk"" </quote> and what is more, further problems exist regarding the abnormalities which leave a child seriously handicapped. <#> Grubb asks if an abortion would be justified if a baby is diagnosed as HIV positive in its mother 's womb, given that it will almost certainly be asymptomatic at birth. <#> Pro-life observers allege that the reforms will allow terminations <quote> ""for any reason at all, from harelip to hair colour."" </quote> <sp> 13 </sp> <#> As Douglas notes, it is regrettable that, by directing their opposition towards women attempting to obtain early abortions, anti-abortionists ended up by facilitating the enactment of a piece of legislation which, frankly, looks eugenic. </p>
 <p> <#> However, it seems that although in theory abortions on the three grounds without a time limit could be performed up to the birth of the child, in practice a number of factors will minimize such cases and mean that little will change with regard to the incidence of abortion. <#> Firstly, at present, the trend is towards earlier rather than later abortions. <#> Most abortions are performed within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy and few are performed after eighteen weeks. <sp> 14 </sp> <#> Also, the certifying doctor need only form the opinion <quote> ""in good faith"" </quote> that the matters set out exist. <#> The Act does not require that they objectively do - honesty seems to be sufficient to satisfy the Act. <#> Another factor is that the decision to perform the abortion is subject to the regulatory requirements under the Act, a private one between the doctor and patient. <#> No other individual has standing prospectively to challenge the legality of abortion under English law. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Judicial Model </bold> <h>
 <p> <#> This model exists where courts have held abortion lawful if the accused performs and abortion in the honest belief that it is necessary in order to preserve the woman 's physical or mental health. <#> A pragmatic approach is adopted in the interpretation of the criminal statutes. <#> Northern Ireland abortion law, which is rarely discussed outside of NI itself, provides an example of the working of this type of model. </p>
 <p> <#> Abortion has been characterised as the <quote> ""big guilty secret of Northern Ireland"" </quote> <sp> 15 </sp>. <#> Until 1967, the law in Northern Ireland regarding abortion was the same as that in England. <#> However, as the legal organs of Government in England continued to develop and change the law there, the situation in Northern Ireland remained static because no such organs exist. <#> In 1990, the British Parliament debated a series of reforms to the 1967 Abortion Act in England. <#> One proposal was the extension of the Act to Northern Ireland, however, this was opposed by all the 16/17 Members of Parliament in the House of Commons who represent the constituencies within the province. <#> It was also opposed by all the political parties there with the exception of Sinn Fein, which declared itself neutral on the issue. <#> Eventually the reform was defeated by a ratio of two votes to one. </p>
 <p> <#> In practice, the courts in Northern Ireland have said that abortion is legal under certain circumstances, however the problem is that doctors are so fearful of the uncertainty of the law that few are willing to carry out the operation, even with judicial support. <#> This is clearly illustrated in the case of <it> Re K <sp> 16 </sp> </it> which shall now be examined. </p>
 <p> <#> The Northern Irish Health Board made an application to the court for its ward, K to travel outside Northern Ireland for an abortion. <#> K was a 14 year old girl who lived with her father until his own ill-health and her unruliness meant that he was no longer able to care for her. <#> She became subject to a Fit Person Order and, at the age of thirteen, became pregnant whilst in a children 's home. <#> She wanted to have an abortion and threatened suicide if she was forced to carry the pregnancy to term. <#> She reinforced the threat by cutting her wrists with broken glass, refusing food and punching her stomach in order to harm the foetus. <#> A psychiatrist testified that there was a substantial risk of suicide if the pregnancy continues and his opinion was corroborated by that of two other doctors. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Radon in Buildings <*> asterisk </*> </h>
 <h> <#> J. Connell, B.Arch, MRIAI
 <#> Senior Research Architect, Environmental Research Unit </bold> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> 1. Introduction </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> For several years now members of the international radiation protection community have been expressing anxiety about the effect of natural radiation on the health of persons. <#> It is expected that this concern will be given concrete expression in this country when the Building Regulations are introduced. <#> They are expected to call for precautions to be taken to avoid danger to the health of occupants of buildings caused by radioactive substances in the ground under buildings. <#> This will include radon which is a radioactive gas. </p>
 <p> <#> Designers of buildings will be faced with a problem in complying with this requirement. <#> This arises firstly, due to the difficulty in predicting prior to construction the likelihood of harmful levels of indoor radon <}> <-> occuring </-> <+> occurring </+> </}> in the completed building and secondly, in advising on the type and extent of any precautions that should be taken at the design stage. <#> There is also the matter of legal liability. <#> It would be prudent at the present time for designers of houses, schools and certain other buildings of long time occupation, to raise the matter of radon protection with their clients, as otherwise, with the widespread awareness of the radiation problem, they could be held to be guilty of professional negligence. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 2. Facts about Radon </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> About 13 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total radiation exposure is made up from man-made nuclear and medical activities and the remaining 87 <*> per cent sign </*> from natural sources. <#> Exposure to any form of radiation may cause harm to the exposed person or his or her descendants and there is no intrinsic difference between artificial and natural radiation in their biological effects. <#> In contrast to the demand for strict controls over exposure to artificial radiation sources, relatively little attention has been given to control of exposures to natural sources. <#> This may have arisen partly from a feeling that what is natural is without harm and also from a lack of awareness about precautions which could be taken. <#> However, in recent years there has been a growing concern among those dealing with radiation matters about the long <}> <-> terms </-> <+> term </+> </}> effects of radiation at all levels and the circumstances where exposure could, and probably should, be reduced. <#> This is particularly so in the case of indoor exposure to radon and its decay products which accounts for over 30 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total radiation. </p>
 <p> <#> Radon is a natural radioactive gas that has no taste, smell or colour and requires special equipment to detect its presence. <#> It is part of the decay chain of uranium, which is widely dispersed in the earths crust, and its best known decay product, radium, which is the immediate precursor of radon. <#> Most soil and rock have traces of radon but the amount can vary in different parts of the country and at different times of the year. <#> Being a gas, it can move through porous media such as fractured rock and soil and some is exhaled at the surface. <#> When this occurs in the outdoor air it is dispersed in the atmosphere and diluted to low and harmless concentrations. <#> However, once it percolates into a enclosed space such as a building it can accumulate to dangerous levels because dispersion is restricted by the limited ventilation. <#> The concentration will depend on the radon levels in the soil gas, the construction details of the building and the available ventilation. <#> Radon may also be introduced indoors in ground water supplied from a well, or from building materials containing traces of radium, but normally the amounts from these sources are not of any consequence in this country. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 3. Entry Routes </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The increase in indoor levels of radon in recent decades is due most likely to the search for ""tighter"" building enclosures in order to reduce energy consumption. </p>
 <p> <#> These levels depend mainly on the concentration of the sub-floor soil gas and the available entry points in the ground floor area of the building. <#> As these factors usually vary from building to building each case must be considered separately. <#> The more fragmented and porous the underlying rock and soil the greater the amount of radon gas that can rise to the surface. <#> This gas can enter a building in a convective flow through cracks and holes in the floor area and any gaps around service pipes and cables (Figure 1). <#> It is usually pressure-driven due to the slightly lower indoor air pressure compared with that under the floor, a result of wind and temperature difference. <#> As might be expected, elevated levels of radon resulting from soil gas are found mainly in basements and at ground floor levels. <#> Also, radon gas is nine times heavier than air, and therefore tends to remain close to the ground. <#> Radon is not normally a problem in high rise buildings and if an elevated level is found it is likely to have been caused by emission from the building materials used. </p>
 <&> picture </&>
 <h> <bold> <#> 4. Lung Cancer </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The reason for concern about radon is its association with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. <#> Radon being radioactive disintegrates and gives off decay products known as daughters or progeny which are also radioactive. <#> These are minute particles which when released in the air may be inhaled and deposited in the lungs. <#> As they in turn decay they give a radiation dose to the lung tissues which may eventually cause lung cancer. <#> The risk is related to the level and length of exposure and is normally considered as a lifetime risk. <#> While few people these days spend a lifetime in the same house it would be foolish to ignore the risk completely and for some, the predictions over a lifetime are likely to be significant. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 5. Occurrence in Ireland </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Radioactivity in air resulting from radon is measured in becquerel per cubic metre (Bq/m3). <#> This unit of measurement means that radon is present at a concentration that emits one particle of radiation per second in a cubic metre of air. <#> A survey carried out by Dr. J.P. McLaughlin of University College Dublin of a random sample of approximately 1300 houses in the State shows a median level of indoor radon of about 35 Bq/m3 throughout the country. </p>
 <p> <#> <*> asterisk </*> The Editor wishes to apologise sincerely to Mr Connell for allowing the gremlins to wreak havoc with his excellent article when first published in the August/September issue. </p>
 <p> <#> However, levels in excess of 400 Bq/m3 were found in 1.5 <*> per cent sign </*> of cases with individual peaks rising as high as 1700 Bq/m3. <#> Most of these were located in parts of counties Clare, Galway, Mayo and Cork, but even in these counties the vast majority of the sample houses had a low radon level. <#> A more recent survey of over 500 houses in some western countries was carried out by the Nuclear Energy Board and U.C.D. to identify the distribution of elevated concentration in these areas. <#> The results indicate that about 2.8 <*> per cent sign </*> had radon levels above 400 Bq/m3 and that 9.4 <*> per cent sign </*> were above 200 Bq/m3. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 6. Reference Level </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Having a screening measurement carried out is the only way of knowing if a house has a radon problem. <#> A recommended Reference Level for Ireland has been set by the Government at 200 Bq/m3 for the annual average radon gas concentration in an existing home. <#> Above this level action should be taken to reduce it. <#> The level of 200 Bq/m3 is also intended to apply to all future houses which ideally should be constructed so that radon concentrations are as low as reasonably practicable and be at least below this level. <#> In existing houses, for levels up to 500 Bq/m3 it would be desirable to take action within a few years and where levels are over 1000 Bq/m3, within a year or so. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 7. Risks </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> For most people, the risk of developing lung cancer from radon is insignificant compared with other everyday risks. <#> Nevertheless, despite the lack of complete agreement among experts on the precise risk, it has been calculated that exposure to the Reference Level of an annual average of 200 Bq/m3 corresponds to a lifetime risk of lung cancer of about 2.5 <*> per cent sign </*>. <#> The normal lifetime risk of contracting lung cancer in Ireland is about 3 <*> per cent sign </*>. </p>
 <p> <#> International estimates now suggest that between 5 <*> per cent sign </*> and 10 <*> per cent sign </*> of lung cancer deaths may be caused by indoor radon exposure. <#> There is also strong evidence which indicates a much higher risk from radon for cigarette smokers <}> <-> that </-> <+> than </+> </}> for non-smokers. <#> The National Radiological Protection Board in the U.K. in a 1990 publication puts this risk at 10 times that for non-smokers at all levels of exposure. <#> This arises from a synergistic or multiplicative interaction of both carcinogens, which means that the combined effect exceeds the sum of the two effects taken independently. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 8. Methods of Detection </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The two most common devices used for measuring indoor radon concentrations are the alpha track detector and the charcoal canister. <#> The charcoal canister is a small container of activated carbon which absorbs radon. <#> It is exposed in a living area for about a week and then sent to a laboratory for analysis. <#> The alpha track gives a more accurate reading of the average exposure but must be left in place for a longer period, usually three months, to cover the widely fluctuating daily and seasonal variations. <#> The detector consists of a small container which allows the alpha particles released by the radon to come in contact inside the container with a small piece of special plastic in which tracks are formed by the radiation striking it. <#> After exposure for the recommended time it is also sent to a laboratory for analysis. <#> The <}> <-> intial </-> <+> initial </+> </}> screening measurement may indicate that there is no need for further action, but in some cases it may be necessary to take measurements over a longer period to get a more accurate estimate of the average level. <#> There are other techniques requiring operation by trained personnel which can be used to give ""instant"" reading, but they are more expensive and, due to the normal variation in concentrations over a short period of time, would be certainly less reliable in determining the average radon level. </p>
 <p> <#> It is possible to take radon measurements in the ground on a prospective building site, but the results may be of limited value. <#> Alfa track detectors may be buried in holes about 600mm deep and recovered after exposure for one week. <#> If high readings are found there is no doubt about the need for preventative measures. <#> Low readings in the ground, however, may not be taken as a guarantee of low concentrations inside a future building on the site, as any excavation necessary during construction may increase the release of soil gas which could result in high indoor concentrations. <#> After construction it would probably be necessary to have indoor measurements taken in both cases to find out the actual level inside the building. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 9. Prediction of Concentration </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> One of the difficulties at present with the occurrence of radon gas is that no reliable method has been found for identifying the geographical areas most at risk. <#> There is evidence linking high radon levels with underlying areas of uranium-bearing granite, shales, phosphate and certain sandstones, but this pattern is not entirely reliable which makes it difficult to prepare maps predicting areas of high concentrations based on geographical data. <#> As an alternative, national surveys based on map grids are extremely expensive and lengthy exercises and result in only very general indications due to the variations in radon concentrations that may occur within small areas. </p>

 <h> <#> What the changes in health and social services mean for you </h>
 <h> <#> About this booklet </h>
 <p> <#> Every person in Northern Ireland comes into contact with the Health and Personal Social Services at some time, be it simply a visit to their GP or dentist, or perhaps a spell in hospital for something more serious. <#> For those who, for whatever reason are unable to live independently Ð for example disabled or elderly people Ð contact with the caring services will be much more frequent, perhaps with visits at home by social work or community nursing staff. </p>
 <p> <#> So the changes taking place in the Health and Personal Social Services are of interest to everyone. <#> Some people however are worried about what services will be available in the future. <#> Some of the questions being asked are: <#> - will I still be able to get my prescription, even if the medicines are expensive? <#> - if my family doctor has a practice fund, will I still get the treatment I need? <#> - can I still have a choice of hospital if I need treatment? <#> - will I still have a choice about where I have my baby? <#> - will hospitals which become self-governing Trusts stay completely within the health service? <#> - will health services still be free? </p>
 <p> <#> The answer to all these questions is <quote> ""Yes"". </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> This booklet has been designed to provide answers to questions like these and to give other information as well. <#> However, it does not list all the services that are available. <#> Information about services that are not covered here can be obtained from the bodies listed at the end of the booklet. </p>
 <h> <#> The Government 's proposals </h>
 <p> <#> The reforms described in subsequent pages result mainly from the Government 's White Papers ""Promoting Better Health"", which was published in 1987, and ""Working for Patients"", published in 1989. <#> These proposals were aimed at making the Health Service more responsive to the needs of people and more concerned about improving their health, rather than just treating their illnesses. </p>
 <h> <#> Community care services </h>
 <p> <#> Since the publication of these White Papers the Department of Health and Social Services has issued ""People First"", in March 1990, which contained proposals for the future development of community care. <#> These are in line with the Government 's approach to community care services, which is that they should be flexible and sensitive to individual need, that they should offer choice, intervene no more than necessary and should concentrate on those with the greatest needs. </p>
 <p> <#> This booklet does not over the changes in community care Ð many of which will not be in place before 1993. <#> However further information will be made available in the future. </p>
 <h> <#> The welfare of children </h>
 <p> <#> An important part of the community care reforms will be new laws dealing with the welfare of children, which will be published for consultation later this year. <#> The new legislation will reform the present law dealing with the care, protection and upbringing of children and the provision of services for them and their families and draw them together into single and more accessible code. </p>
 <h> <#> Your family doctor </h>
 <p> <#> Your family doctor Ð or GP Ð will be able to offer you and your family a wider range of services in future. <#> There will be more emphasis on promoting good health and preventing disease. </p>
 <h> <#> SERVICES FOR THE FAMILY </h>
 <p> <#> Good health care is not just about treating you when you are ill, but also about giving help and advice so that you stay fit and well. </p>
 <p> <#> The Department 's Chief Medical Officer says:
 <#> <quote> <it> ""More and more nowadays, people are realising the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. <#> There are no spin-offs: healthy people make fewer calls on the resources that we put into treating the sick and injured; and they enjoy life more. <#> So the emphasis in the future must be more on prevention, less on cure."" </it> </quote> </p>
 <p> <#> What services should you now look out for? </p>
 <h> <it> <#> For all adults </it> </h>
 <p> <#> You will be able to get regular ""life-style"" check-ups. <#> These will be offered to you when you first register with a doctor, or if you have not seen your doctor for some time. <#> The purpose of these check-ups is to: <#> - give you the chance to discuss anything worrying you; <#> - provide an opportunity to carry out a few simple tests (such as checking your blood pressure); <#> - offer professional advice if need on such matters as diet, exercise, smoking and drinking. </p>
 <p> <#> In other words, your GP can advise you on how to look after yourself. <#> This may include recommending that you attend one of the practice 's health promotion clinics. </p>
 <p> <#> GPs will be encouraged to provide more health promotion clinics. <#> These may include clinics giving detailed advice on diet, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, heart disease, drinking and stress. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Family planning services </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Family planning services are available from most GPs and from family planning clinics, which also make services available to men. <#> You can choose where to go for family planning advice. </p>
 <p> <#> If you prefer to get advice from a GP about contraception, you may choose to see a GP other than your own family doctor. <#> Information about whether particular GPs provide contraceptive services is now more readily available (see ""More Information for Patients"" on page 9). </p>
 <p> <#> Details of family planning clinics in your area are available from your local Health and Social Services Board (see the list of addresses at the end of this booklet). <#> In addition to general sessions, you may find that some clinics offer sessions to deal with particular methods of contraception or for particular groups. </p>
 <p> <#> Family planning services are provided free of charge to encourage all those who wish to use the services to do so. </p>
 <h> <it> <#> For women </it> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Cervical screening (smear tests) </h>
 <p> <#> About 40 women die from cervical cancer every year in Northern Ireland. <#> Many of these deaths could be avoided if more women had regular smear tests (known as cervical screening or cervical cytology). </p>
 <p> <#> Improvements are being made to the cervical screening services. <#> How will these affect you? <#> - all women between the ages of 20 and 64 are to be invited for screening (by March 1993). <#> - the new system will ensure that all women in this age group are offered a test at least once every five years. </p>
 <p> <#> Your doctor will be able to give you advice and encourage you to have a smear test if appropriate. </p>
 <p> <#> The aim of the test is to detect conditions that could develop into cancer. <#> If these conditions are found in good time, treatment is usually straightforward and almost always effective. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Breast cancer screening </h>
 <p> <#> Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women. <#> An entirely new province-wide breast cancer screening programme run from specialised centres is being introduced. <#> How will this affect you? <#> - all women between the age of 50 and 64 are to be invited for screening by breast X-ray by March 1994. <#> You will then be invited for screening every three years; <#> - screening for older women (over 64) will be provided on request every three years. </p>
 <p> <#> This service is being targeted at women over the age of 50 because there is as yet little evidence that routine screening is of benefit to younger women. </p>
 <p> <#> Your Health and Social Services Board (see the list of addresses at the end of this booklet) will be able to give you advice on local services, or our doctor can advise you. </p>
 <p> <#> Women registered with a GP will get invitations for cervical and breast screening if appropriate. <#> So please make sure that your GP has your correct address, especially if you have moved house recently. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Well-women clinics </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> GPs will be encouraged to provide more well-women clinics which deal with many issues to do with women 's health. </p>
 <h> <it> <#> For children </it> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Child health </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Your GP may offer a programme for following the development of your young children (under five years old). <#> That means checks, in your GP 's surgery, on the height, weight, growth, development of the senses and other essential features in the first five years of your child 's life. <#> Where your GP does not do this work, it will still be provided at local community clinics. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Childhood immunisation </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> If you don't get your children immunised against childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough you are putting them at risk. <#> These illnesses can be very distressing and sometimes dangerous. <#> Your doctor will encourage you to make sure that your children get the protection of safe immunisation. </p>
 <p> <#> The table below shows when you should get your child immunised (but if your child is older and has not been fully immunised it is not too late to see your doctor). </p>
 <&> table </&>
 <h> <it> <#> If you are over 75 </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Each year your doctor will offer you an assessment of your health and circumstances to make sure that all is well. </p>
 <p> <#> You can have this check-up done in your own home or at the doctor 's practice or surgery. <#> In any event, your doctor will offer to visit you at home, or arrange for one of the professional practice staff to visit you, to make sure you are well and able to cope. </p>
 <p> <#> These services are strongly recommended. <#> They offer the chance to get advice on how to deal with the problems everyone faces in old age. <#> Failing eyesight, hearing difficulties, trouble with your feet and similar problems can often be helped once they have been identified. </p>
 <h> <#> A BETTER FAMILY DOCTOR SERVICE </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Greater convenience for patients </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Changes are taking place in the way your doctor 's surgery is run. <#> Over the next few years you may find: <#> - more convenient surgery hours; <#> - more comfortable waiting rooms; <#> - minor surgery available on your doctor 's own premises, to save having to go to hospital. </p>
 <p> <#> Will your doctor be able to spend as much time with you? <#> - Yes. <#> There are now more family doctors than ever before. <#> As practice teams develop, you may be able to see not only the doctor, but the nurse, chiropodist and physiotherapist. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> More information for patients </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> More information is now available to help you know more about the services your doctor provides. </p>
 <p> <#> - Health and Social Services Boards now produce directories of local family doctors, giving information about each doctor and the service the practice provides. <#> You can find the address of your Health and Social Services Board on page 20 of this booklet. </p>
 <p> <#> - Each GP practice is now producing leaflets telling you about the range of health services available from the practice. </p>
 <p> <#> - Moving to another doctor if you want to is now easier. <#> All you have to do is go to the surgery of the doctor of your choice and ask to be registered. <#> If your new doctor agrees to put you on his or her list, that 's it. <#> Different doctors may offer different types of services and their leaflets will help you choose. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> General Practice funding scheme </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Family doctors already play a vital role in the health and social services and they will play an even greater role in future. <#> From April 1993, bigger practices will be able to choose to take control of funds to finance a range of local services for their own patients Ð including certain hospital treatments, and the cost to the services of prescriptions and some staff needed for the practice. </p>
 <p> <#> If your GP chooses to join the practice funding scheme, what will it mean? </p>
 <p> <#> - The level of funds will be agreed between your GP and the Department of Health and Social Services. <#> It will take into account the health care needs of all the patients on the practice list Ð for example, the extra requirements of elderly people, patients with special needs, the hospital services likely to be used and so on. </p>
 <p> <#> - Your GP will be able to use the fund to arrange the right treatment for you speedily and effectively. <#> For example, your GP should have greater flexibility to look around for treatment in hospitals which offer the shortest waiting times. <#> The aim is to improve the choice of good quality services available to you and your GP. </p>
 <p> <#> - The practice will be able to use any savings from the fund for your benefit Ð for example, in employing another nurse or buying new diagnostic equipment for the surgery. </p>
 <p> <#> So if your doctor has a practice fund, will you still get the treatment you need? </p>
 <p> <#> - Yes. <#> GPs will get sufficient funds to enable them to provide full and proper treatment for their patients. <#> Even if the practice overspends its funds, there is no question of people not getting the treatment they need. </p>

 <h> <#> 5th March, 1991 </h> <h> <#> Mrs Mary O'Rourke, T.D., <#> Minister for Education <#> Department of Education <#> Marlborough Street <#> Dublin1. </h>
 <p> <#> Dear Minister,</p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> The Future Structure of the National University of Ireland
  Introduction </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> When the representatives of the University were received by you on 23 January 1990, you confirmed that consideration of future structures could proceed on the basis that, whatever choice was made, there would be no diminution of autonomy in relation to appointments and the general conduct of university business. <#> You suggested that the University 's preferred option should be brought forward as soon as possible. </p>
 <p> <#> It is now possible to summarise the outcome of the consideration given to the matter by the three Constituent Colleges, St Patrick 's College, Maynooth (a Recognised College) and the Senate of the University. <#> The reports of the four Colleges are given in full in the Appendix to this letter. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> General approach </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Despite differences as to the extent and degree of change desired, it is the common preference of the four Colleges to remain constituent elements of a NUI system but each with the status and title of a university and a significant redistribution in its favour of powers and functions. <#> This would mean that, while the corpus of existing legislation, charters and statutes would be preserved, amendments would need to be effected by new legislation with the principal object of transferring certain powers and functions at present exercised by the Senate of NUI to the appropriate bodies of the constituent universities, with the Senate retaining residual responsibilities regarding appointments procedures and standards of degrees and diplomas. <#> The following paragraphs set out the consensus arrived at by the Senate on particular aspects of this general approach. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Status and Title </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> (i)The present three Constituent Colleges, while retaining all their existing powers and functions, should become constituent universities of the National University of Ireland and be entitled in Irish and English, respectively: <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Baile &/Atha Claith </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Dublin <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Corcaigh </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Cork <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Gaillimh </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Galway </p>
 <p> <#> (ii) St Patrick 's College, Maynooth, in its faculties or arts, celtic studies, philosophy and science, should become a constituent university of the National University of Ireland and be entitled in Irish and English, respectively:
 <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, M&/a Nuad </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Maynooth
 <p> <#> Appropriate provision should be made for representation of the Senate of NUI on the Governing Body and vice-versa. </p>
 <p> <#> (iii) The constituent universities may extend the above titles in a manner which indicates that they are successors to a specified Constituent or Recognised College or that they are constituent universities of the National University of Ireland. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Transfer of Power and Functions </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> (i) Provision should be made specifically in legislation for the amendment of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, and associated Charters so as to effect the transfer of powers and functions from the Senate of the NUI to the appropriate bodies of the respective constituent universities which is described below under the headings of Appointments, and Courses and Standards for Degrees and Diplomas. </p>
 <p> <#> (ii) Provision should also be made for flexibility in authorising future agreed evolution of the relations between the NUI and its constituent universities. <#> This could be achieved by providing that further changes in powers and functions proposed by the NUI on the recommendation or with the agreement of the constituent university(ies) could be statutorily authorised, subject to ratification (passive or active) by both Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Internal Procedures </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> To afford them operational flexibility, constituent universities should be empowered (notwithstanding any restriction in existing legislation) to make by way of university statute, after consultation with the Senate of NUI, such changes as might be decided by the relevant Governing Body in the internal organisation or procedures of that university. <#> Such statute should have effect when it had lain before both Houses of the Oireachtas for a prescribed period without being annulled. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Appointments </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> (i) Persons who at present hold posts in the Colleges which are to become constituent universities, whether appointed thereto by the relevant College authority or by the Senate of the NUI, should be confirmed as holders of equivalent posts, without disimprovement in terms, conditions or entitlements, in the relevant constituent universities. </p>
 <p> <#> (ii) Persons who hold permanent academic posts to which they were appointed by the Governing Body of a Constituent College, should become lecturers of the relevant constituent university and, without prejudice to grades or salary scales, enjoy the advantages possessed by lecturers appointed by the Senate of the NUI, as regards tenure, membership of the Academic Council and the holding of any other office or responsibility in the constituent university. </p>
 <p> <#> (iii) Each constituent university should have the power to appoint its own staff but, in relation to permanent academic staff, including the President, and academic staff appointed for a fixed term of years, appointments should be made only in accordance with such appointments procedure as might be approved from time to time by the Senate of the NUI either generally or in particular categories or cases. <#> These appointments should be provisional for the first month and then become effective unless within the month an objection, on the basis of alleged non-conformity with the approved procedure, were made by an interested party to the relevant Governing Body, and reported to the Registrar of NUI. <#> Pending resolution of the objection (within, say, two months at the outside), the appointment should remain provisional. <#> (The basic element in the appointments procedure to be approved by the Senate of the NUI would be an appropriately constituted assessment board including an external expert or external experts). </p>
 <p> <#> (iv) Persons who, in accordance with paragraphs (i) - (iii) above, hold appointments as Professors, Readers or Lecturers in constituent universities shall also, so long as they hold these appointments, be Professors, Readers or Lecturers, respectively, of the National University of Ireland. </p>
 <p> <#> (v) The functions of the Senate of NUI regarding removal from office of persons to whom paragraphs (i) - (iii) refer should pass to the relevant constituent universities, subject to the right of appeal to the Visitor. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Courses and Standards for Degrees and Diplomas </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The constituent universities should establish their own degree and diploma courses, set their own marks and standards and, in consultation with the relevant external examiners, set their own examinations. <#> The courses so established would be subject, from time to time, to review by an academic committee of the Senate of NUI, after consultation with the relevant external examiners. <#> Any comments resulting from such periodic review would be communicated to the constituent universities for their consideration. <#> The present General Board of Studies should be abolished. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> External Examiners </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> External examiners should continue to be appointed by the Senate of NUI on the agreed recommendation of the constituent universities, with appropriate functions, including the additional function indicated in the preceding paragraph, but with flexibility as to the manner of discharging these functions. </p>
 <h><ul> <bold> <#> Degrees and Diplomas </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The degrees and diplomas awarded by the constituent universities should be degrees and diplomas of the National University of Ireland and should be so designated. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Entrance requirements for students </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The Senate should continue to approve basic matriculation conditions for the NUI system as a whole. <#> The constituent universities would be free to prescribe additional requirements for entry to particular faculties. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Recognised Colleges </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Provision should continue to exist for third-level educational establishments to be associated with a constituent university and to be designated as Recognised Colleges of the NUI. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Theology (or Religious Studies) </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Abolition is recommended of those provisions of Section 7 of the 1908 Act which prohibit the public funding of 'any theological or religious teaching or study' and, even where private funding is involved, lay down other restrictions. </p>
 <h> ><ul> <bold> <#> Finance </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Funding of the NUI itself (as distinct from the constituent universities) should be mainly by the charging of appropriate fees (e.g. in relation to matriculation, degrees and diplomas). <#> Supplemental public funding should be provided for. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Effect of Proposals </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> These proposals would confer the status and title of universities on U.C.D., U.C.C., U.C.G., and St. Patrick 's College, Maynooth, and transfer to them wide-ranging discretion to conduct their own affairs. <#> The National University of Ireland, which has played a historically significant role in national education and development, would continue to provide an important public service. <#> In its co-ordinating role the NUI, acting through its head-office and its Senate, would be concerned with the maintenance of appropriate university entrance standards and the highest international standing for degrees and diplomas. <#> It would also provide assurance of impartiality and excellence in academic appointments and would be a forum for consideration of developmental policies in education in Ireland and in the evolving European Community. </p>
 <h> ><ul> <bold> <#> Conclusion </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It is hoped that the proposals will commend themselves to you and the Government and that a decision will be taken to introduce legislation accordingly to amend the 1908 Act and associated Charters. <#> Officers of the University are considering the particular amendments required and will be glad to assist in the formulation of appropriate heads of a bill. </p>
 <p> <#> It would be appreciated if representatives of the University could have a preliminary meeting with you soon for any clarification you may desire and for a general discussion of the proposals. </p>
 <p> <#> Yours sincerely, <#> Kenneth Whitaker <#> Chancellor </p>

 <p> <#> While these questions are not paramount in your day to day activities they are quite critical in the process of making the transition from university to employment. <#> You can do it! <#> It is worth the effort to identify your skills and interests, your values and what motivates you. <#> When it comes to selecting jobs and filling in application forms you will spend less time scratching your head in search of an elusive answer and more time providing evidence that you fit the employer 's criteria. <#> You are also likely to be more content with your choice than someone who wanders along waiting for a bolt of lightning to strike them on the way to a lecture. <#> Career choice tends to occur not as a sudden revelation but as a result of a process which you start and you manage. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Making your decision Ð overcoming obstacles </bold> </h>
 <h> bold> <#> Getting to know yourself Ð on computer </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Technology can prove useful here. <#> You need to identify attitudes, personality traits and skills that might help you choose suitable job areas. <#> For example you might know that some of the following are important for you: <#> a) a job working with people Ð advising, guiding them or caring for their physical and/or emotional health. <#> b) a job where you want to see the end product of your endeavours such as project management, management consultancy etc. <#> c) a job where you need to motivate, manage and develop other staff and colleagues. <#> d) a job which is fast moving and change-orientated. </p>
 <p> <it> <#> Prospect Planner </it> is a powerful interactive computer package which can help you analyse all these factors in a rational logical manner. <#> It allows you to build up profiles of the skills you want to use in work; your personal values in relation to work and will, if you ask it, provide lists of jobs that match the profiles you construct. </p>
 <p> <#> However, a word of caution Ð the programme is great but be prepared to get a long list of jobs. <#> Some may seem at the least mildly entertaining, others somewhat strange, but remember the computer applies logic based on the information you input. <#> Thinking about why it suggests you should become a member of the clergy, an accountant or even a careers adviser can be useful because it will enable you to identify the pattern and skill of matching yourself to jobs. <#> If you can make this connection you are well on the way to making informed and successful career decisions. <#> Finally, <it> Prospect Planner </it> lets you store and/or print off the work you do. <#> Do speak to a careers adviser if you are unsure about any part of your printout. <#> <it> Prospects Planner </it> is available in the Careers Service. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Getting to know yourself Ð on paper </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> If you prefer a less dynamic approach, Queen 's Careers Service has several good books to guide you through this process. <#> For example, <it> No idea about a career? </it> by Chris Phillips or <it> What colour is your parachute? </it> by R. Nelson Bolles may be most appropriate for your needs. <#> Do try both approaches to find out which tool Ð computer or paper Ð best suits you. </p>
 <h> <bold> <h> Graduate employment </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In recent years graduate employment has changed and the signs are that change will continue. <#> Driven by technology and competition, organisations tend to be leaner and flatter in structure with a focus on results. <#> The small business sector continues to expand with a strong emphasis on entrepreneurship. <#> So whilst the traditional areas of graduate employment may have changed, there is still significant demand for graduates, particularly those who can present an effective combination of academic achievement, work experience and personal and employability skills. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Skills employers look for </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Remember that employers want to recruit the best graduate for the job. <#> To enable them to distinguish between applicants they ask that graduates offer a profile of skills relevant to work and progression within it. <#> The current buzz word for this profile is 'employability skills' Ð ie skills which are work related and central to job success. </p>
 <p> <#> Broadly these skills can be views under four main headings: </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Specialist </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It helps to be an expert at something, eg marketing, tax accounting, family law, aerospace engineering, marine biology, organisational psychology. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Generalist </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It helps to have general business skills and knowledge, eg finance/basic accounting, written communication, problem solving, use of IT. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Connected </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It helps to be a team player, eg management skills, meetings skills, negotiation skills, networking skills, presentation skills. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Self-reliant </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It helps to be able to work alone as well as with others, eg confidence, self-awareness, action planning, political awareness. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Developing your employability skills </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> These skills are essentially work-related, central to job success and you should consider ways of developing them. <#> Here are some examples of how to develop them: <#> 1. Register for the Skills to Succeed programme which has been developed and is delivered by staff from the Careers Service. <#> The programme lasts for two hours per week over one semester and will help you to: <#> <*> bullet point </*> identify the skills developed through study and part-time work <#> <*> bullet point </*> develop knowledge in relation to employer expectations of graduates <#> <*> bullet point </*> demonstrate employability skills <#> <*> bullet point </*> increase your awareness of the range of graduate opportunities available to you <#> <*> bullet point </*> acquire increased confidence and competence at handling selection methods used by graduate recruiters. </p>
 <p> <#> Successful completion of this course will lead to the award of a University Certificate in Career Management and Employability Skills. </p>
 <p> <#> 2. A level 2 undergraduate module in career management and employability skills is available to second year students during first and second semesters. <#> This provides a sound basis for if you are considering taking a year out on placement or if you want to build employability skills into your degree. <#> Find out more about the Skills to Succeed programme and the module in Career Management and Employability from Queen 's Careers Service. </p>
 <p> <#> 3. Consider building the learning for Work module into your degree. <#> This is available to Level 2 and 3 students as a free-standing module. <#> It provides undergraduates with an opportunity to develop the skills and competences they will need in their future careers through project work. <#> Find out more from the Centre for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (CELT), 75 University www.qub.ac.uk/celt/module. </p>
 <p> <#> 4. Get involved with a student society of Student Consultative Committee (SCC). <#> Remember Ð you will need to be active in these groups in order to develop skills. <#> Turning up to a meeting isn't enough. </p>
 <p> <#> 5. Make the most of casual or part-time jobs. <#> You will often get more responsibility if you ask for it or demonstrate that you can cope with it. <#> Go on in-house training courses if available Ð a customer care or telesales course might give you an edge over others at interview. </p>
 <p> <#> The Students ' Jobshop@Queen 's can help you find part-time work Ð www.qub.ac.uk/jobshop. </p>
 <p> <#> 6. You can develop your skills through social activities related to your personal interests, eg coaching or captaining sports teams, fund raising for a charity, doing voluntary youth or community work. </p>
 <p> <#> 7. Use vacations constructively Ð get a casual job, or better still and undergraduate vacation placement (read <it> Work Experience Bulletin </it> regularly) or travel. <#> Look for and make the most of opportunities available Ð employers are not impressed with the <quote> 'I didn't know about that' </quote> approach. <#> Section 4, Work experience may give you some ideas, as will the <it> Queen 's Guide to Work Experience </it> , available from the Work Placement Centre, 8 Malone Road. </p>
 <p> <#> 8. Take a year out Ð an invaluable way of developing the skills that employers seek. <#> The Careers Service advertises semester and year out placements throughout the year. </p>
 <p> <#> 9. Be aware that through studying for your degree you can develop, for example, time management, team work and presentation skills. </p>
 <p> <#> Remember developing work-related and interpersonal skills and enjoying your time at university are not mutually exclusive. <#> Just think about what you can do on a day to day basis and relate it to the bigger picture Ð easy when you think about it! </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> To summarise </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> There are several resources available to help you to make career decisions. <#> It will help if you: </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 1. Begin to plan your future early.</bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This sounds as boring as watching paint dry but it doesn't have to be. <#> Many things you do at university will help you to make decisions. <#> The trick is to be able to see these activities for what they are and for what they can say about you to an employer (a moment 's thought might get you an interview for a job). </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 2. Don't expect a career to just happen.</bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Few people can truthfully say that their career decisions have been due completely to chance. <#> YOU are the lead player in this process and YOU need to make decisions. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 3. Spend as much time thinking about yourself and what you want from a career as you do in looking for jobs. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Remember that the employers will be matching individuals, not degree transcripts, to jobs. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 4. Are not afraid of getting it wrong. </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It is difficult with limited work experience to choose a career. <#> Remember that your first employer and job are unlikely to be your last. <#> As work patterns become more flexible and change to meet market pressures, the likelihood of a job and employer for life becomes less usual. <#> You will probably find that any job, even if you decide that it isn't going to be a career will develop skills that can be transferred to other employment situations. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> 5. Always have a <it> back-up plan </it> </h>
 <h> <bold> <#> Further sources of help </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Look in the bibliography file in the Careers Service for the full range of books available on career choice and decision making. <#> <it> No idea about a career? </it> by Chris Phillips and <it> What colour is your parachute? </it> by R. Nelson Bolles provide useful starting points. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Work experience </bold> </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> Work experience is an essential part of your university experience. <#> It adds value to your degree and greatly improves your employment prospects. </bold> </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> What counts as work experience? </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The term 'work experience' is used as an umbrella phrase to cover a wide range of experiences. <#> It could be: <#> <*> bullet point </*> formal work experience Ð as in a sandwich placement within your degree <#> <*> bullet point </*> informal Ð as in summer work, a vacation course, work shadowing or a part-time job <*> bullet point </*> <#> related to extra-curricular activities Ð for example, the student who works on the student newspaper is gaining real insight into journalism. <#> Similarly, participating in the Tutoring in Schools Scheme or being a leader with a youth organisation will be considered relevant experience for entry to postgraduate teacher training. </p>
 <p> <#> In an ideal world the best kind of work experience is that which is directly relevant to your future career plans, for instance: <#> <*> bullet point </*> the history student who wants to pursue a career in museum work and spends a vacation working in the Public Records Office <#> <*> bullet point </*> the engineering student who works one summer with a local engineering company and the second summer doing an IAESTE engineering placement overseas. </p>
 <p> <#> Obviously it helps if you have focused on your future plans because then you can try to shape your work experience. <#> You will find that to get into certain careers an element of work experience will be essential Ð social work and clinical psychology are good examples. </p>
 <p> <#> However, not every student will be able to set up this 'ideal' kind of experience, so don't underrate that part-time job in the supermarket, the bar work, or the temporary clerical job. <#> They all count towards giving you an external perspective and help you develop skills for the workplace. </p>

 <h> <#> 5th March, 1991 </h> <h> <#> Mrs Mary O'Rourke, T.D., <#> Minister for Education <#> Department of Education <#> Marlborough Street <#> Dublin1. </h>
 <p> <#> Dear Minister,</p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> The Future Structure of the National University of Ireland
  Introduction </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> When the representatives of the University were received by you on 23 January 1990, you confirmed that consideration of future structures could proceed on the basis that, whatever choice was made, there would be no diminution of autonomy in relation to appointments and the general conduct of university business. <#> You suggested that the University 's preferred option should be brought forward as soon as possible. </p>
 <p> <#> It is now possible to summarise the outcome of the consideration given to the matter by the three Constituent Colleges, St Patrick 's College, Maynooth (a Recognised College) and the Senate of the University. <#> The reports of the four Colleges are given in full in the Appendix to this letter. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> General approach </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Despite differences as to the extent and degree of change desired, it is the common preference of the four Colleges to remain constituent elements of a NUI system but each with the status and title of a university and a significant redistribution in its favour of powers and functions. <#> This would mean that, while the corpus of existing legislation, charters and statutes would be preserved, amendments would need to be effected by new legislation with the principal object of transferring certain powers and functions at present exercised by the Senate of NUI to the appropriate bodies of the constituent universities, with the Senate retaining residual responsibilities regarding appointments procedures and standards of degrees and diplomas. <#> The following paragraphs set out the consensus arrived at by the Senate on particular aspects of this general approach. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Status and Title </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> (i)The present three Constituent Colleges, while retaining all their existing powers and functions, should become constituent universities of the National University of Ireland and be entitled in Irish and English, respectively: <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Baile &/Atha Claith </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Dublin <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Corcaigh </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Cork <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Gaillimh </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Galway </p>
 <p> <#> (ii) St Patrick 's College, Maynooth, in its faculties or arts, celtic studies, philosophy and science, should become a constituent university of the National University of Ireland and be entitled in Irish and English, respectively:
 <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, M&/a Nuad </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Maynooth
 <p> <#> Appropriate provision should be made for representation of the Senate of NUI on the Governing Body and vice-versa. </p>
 <p> <#> (iii) The constituent universities may extend the above titles in a manner which indicates that they are successors to a specified Constituent or Recognised College or that they are constituent universities of the National University of Ireland. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Transfer of Power and Functions </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> (i) Provision should be made specifically in legislation for the amendment of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, and associated Charters so as to effect the transfer of powers and functions from the Senate of the NUI to the appropriate bodies of the respective constituent universities which is described below under the headings of Appointments, and Courses and Standards for Degrees and Diplomas. </p>
 <p> <#> (ii) Provision should also be made for flexibility in authorising future agreed evolution of the relations between the NUI and its constituent universities. <#> This could be achieved by providing that further changes in powers and functions proposed by the NUI on the recommendation or with the agreement of the constituent university(ies) could be statutorily authorised, subject to ratification (passive or active) by both Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Internal Procedures </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> To afford them operational flexibility, constituent universities should be empowered (notwithstanding any restriction in existing legislation) to make by way of university statute, after consultation with the Senate of NUI, such changes as might be decided by the relevant Governing Body in the internal organisation or procedures of that university. <#> Such statute should have effect when it had lain before both Houses of the Oireachtas for a prescribed period without being annulled. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Appointments </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> (i) Persons who at present hold posts in the Colleges which are to become constituent universities, whether appointed thereto by the relevant College authority or by the Senate of the NUI, should be confirmed as holders of equivalent posts, without disimprovement in terms, conditions or entitlements, in the relevant constituent universities. </p>
 <p> <#> (ii) Persons who hold permanent academic posts to which they were appointed by the Governing Body of a Constituent College, should become lecturers of the relevant constituent university and, without prejudice to grades or salary scales, enjoy the advantages possessed by lecturers appointed by the Senate of the NUI, as regards tenure, membership of the Academic Council and the holding of any other office or responsibility in the constituent university. </p>
 <p> <#> (iii) Each constituent university should have the power to appoint its own staff but, in relation to permanent academic staff, including the President, and academic staff appointed for a fixed term of years, appointments should be made only in accordance with such appointments procedure as might be approved from time to time by the Senate of the NUI either generally or in particular categories or cases. <#> These appointments should be provisional for the first month and then become effective unless within the month an objection, on the basis of alleged non-conformity with the approved procedure, were made by an interested party to the relevant Governing Body, and reported to the Registrar of NUI. <#> Pending resolution of the objection (within, say, two months at the outside), the appointment should remain provisional. <#> (The basic element in the appointments procedure to be approved by the Senate of the NUI would be an appropriately constituted assessment board including an external expert or external experts). </p>
 <p> <#> (iv) Persons who, in accordance with paragraphs (i) - (iii) above, hold appointments as Professors, Readers or Lecturers in constituent universities shall also, so long as they hold these appointments, be Professors, Readers or Lecturers, respectively, of the National University of Ireland. </p>
 <p> <#> (v) The functions of the Senate of NUI regarding removal from office of persons to whom paragraphs (i) - (iii) refer should pass to the relevant constituent universities, subject to the right of appeal to the Visitor. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Courses and Standards for Degrees and Diplomas </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The constituent universities should establish their own degree and diploma courses, set their own marks and standards and, in consultation with the relevant external examiners, set their own examinations. <#> The courses so established would be subject, from time to time, to review by an academic committee of the Senate of NUI, after consultation with the relevant external examiners. <#> Any comments resulting from such periodic review would be communicated to the constituent universities for their consideration. <#> The present General Board of Studies should be abolished. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> External Examiners </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> External examiners should continue to be appointed by the Senate of NUI on the agreed recommendation of the constituent universities, with appropriate functions, including the additional function indicated in the preceding paragraph, but with flexibility as to the manner of discharging these functions. </p>
 <h><ul> <bold> <#> Degrees and Diplomas </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The degrees and diplomas awarded by the constituent universities should be degrees and diplomas of the National University of Ireland and should be so designated. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Entrance requirements for students </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The Senate should continue to approve basic matriculation conditions for the NUI system as a whole. <#> The constituent universities would be free to prescribe additional requirements for entry to particular faculties. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Recognised Colleges </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Provision should continue to exist for third-level educational establishments to be associated with a constituent university and to be designated as Recognised Colleges of the NUI. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Theology (or Religious Studies) </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Abolition is recommended of those provisions of Section 7 of the 1908 Act which prohibit the public funding of 'any theological or religious teaching or study' and, even where private funding is involved, lay down other restrictions. </p>
 <h> ><ul> <bold> <#> Finance </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Funding of the NUI itself (as distinct from the constituent universities) should be mainly by the charging of appropriate fees (e.g. in relation to matriculation, degrees and diplomas). <#> Supplemental public funding should be provided for. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Effect of Proposals </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> These proposals would confer the status and title of universities on U.C.D., U.C.C., U.C.G., and St. Patrick 's College, Maynooth, and transfer to them wide-ranging discretion to conduct their own affairs. <#> The National University of Ireland, which has played a historically significant role in national education and development, would continue to provide an important public service. <#> In its co-ordinating role the NUI, acting through its head-office and its Senate, would be concerned with the maintenance of appropriate university entrance standards and the highest international standing for degrees and diplomas. <#> It would also provide assurance of impartiality and excellence in academic appointments and would be a forum for consideration of developmental policies in education in Ireland and in the evolving European Community. </p>
 <h> ><ul> <bold> <#> Conclusion </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It is hoped that the proposals will commend themselves to you and the Government and that a decision will be taken to introduce legislation accordingly to amend the 1908 Act and associated Charters. <#> Officers of the University are considering the particular amendments required and will be glad to assist in the formulation of appropriate heads of a bill. </p>
 <p> <#> It would be appreciated if representatives of the University could have a preliminary meeting with you soon for any clarification you may desire and for a general discussion of the proposals. </p>
 <p> <#> Yours sincerely, <#> Kenneth Whitaker <#> Chancellor </p>

 <p> <#> University students are a highly selected population in that of all those who seek university places in any given year only a proportion succeed. <#> While the selection process is 'objective' in that places are allocated on the basis of examination results, studies of third level entrants have indicated that students from the higher socio-economic groups are over-represented within the higher status (and higher points) faculties (Clancy 1982, 1988). </p>
 <p> <#> Most students obtain their places on the basis of achievement in the Leaving Certificate examination. <#> Some achieve entry on the results of the Matriculation Examination of the National University of Ireland (NUI). <#> Indeed, many students seeking places in NUI colleges sit both examinations as the two sets of results may be combined to calculate points in the allocation of places in these colleges. <#> One can thus 'improve' one 's chance of a university place in the NUI by sitting both examinations. </p>
 <p> <#> Students usually sit for the Leaving Certificate and/or the Matriculation at the end of a five year post-primary programme. <#> There are, however, schools which take six years to complete the course. <#> Schools offering the longer course tend to be the more prestigious academic secondary schools, many of them fee-paying. <#> There are undoubted advantages to a six year programme. <#> Students are usually older and more mature when sitting the Leaving Certificate. <#> The extra year also permits students to develop academic and other skills of lasting value. <#> Students taking six year programmes sit the same examinations and compete for the same university places with those from five year schools. <#> This must give them at least some advantage in the competition for university places. </p>
 <p> <#> In recent years some schools have been given the option of offering an extra 'transition' year to pupils between the end of the junior and the beginning of the senior cycles. <#> This extra year will undoubtedly perform the function of permitting the maturation of students prior to taking the Leaving Certificate. <#> In addition, transition programmes provide all students, those seeking third level entrance and those intending to complete formal education at the end of the senior cycle, with skills and knowledge of a wider and more practical type than would be attained within the traditional curriculum. <#> However, not all schools have sought, or been given, this option. <#> Further, when available within any given school, the transition year may be optional, or may be available to selected pupils only, for example, those who are adjudged too young to proceed to senior cycle, or those who are perceived by the school authorities as being capable of benefitting from it, however this may be judged. </p>
 <p> <#> Students failing to obtain a university place, or their preferred place, may re-sit for one or both examinations, on one or more occasions. <#> There are indications that this practice is becoming more popular. <#> In some third level institutions, including universities (though excluding University College Dublin and University College Cork), students are permitted to combine the results of more than one sitting of these examinations for purposes of scoring 'points ', though this practice is to be discontinued as and from 1992. <#> However, students will continue to have a second or further chance to compete for a third level place without penalty apart from an extra year in school and the payment of the appropriate fees. </p>
 <p> <#> It might be argued, then, that students competing for university and other third level places to not do so on an equal footing. <#> Some students have prepared for five years, others for six, even seven, as some who repeat the examinations do so following a six year school programme. <#> Students who re-sit on one or more occasions might also be considered to have benefitted from examination practice.</p>
 <p> <#> The vast majority of Irish children receive their education within 'recognised' post-primary schools. <#> All these schools, including those charging fees, receive government funding, the amount and type being dependent on the type of school. <#> Nonetheless, students at fee-paying schools are charged significantly less than the economic cost of their education as are students who elect to repeat the Leaving Certificate within 'recognised' schools. <#> Thus, much of the extra preparation for third level entrance is paid for from public funds, although it is individuals who benefit. </p>
 <p> <#> Students preparing for examinations leading to third level entrance may also seek extra help in one or more subjects. <#> Occasionally, this may be obtained at home, from family or friends, or schools may offer some students additional classes. <#> More commonly, however, such help is obtained outside the family and school from individuals or groups who offer specific examination coaching in one or more subjects. <#> In recent years there appears to be an increase in the number of individuals and tutorial colleges offering specialised individual or small class tuition. <#> The colleges may also run short intensive revision courses in the school holidays, and some also provide a full-time Leaving Certificate course, aimed mostly at students repeating for better results. </p>
 <p> <#> None of these groups or individuals receives any state support. <#> They operate as business enterprises, charging relatively high fees on an hourly or yearly basis. <#> We do not know how many students use these facilities, and for what subjects. <#> Nor do we know who uses them, or whether they give students an advantage when competing for scarce third level places. <#> That their numbers appear to be growing and that they are paid for out of individuals ' pockets seems to indicate that at least some people believe that extra tuition is valuable. <#> As a relatively expensive 'optional extra' it is likely that the students who use such facilities are from the more advantaged social backgrounds. <#> They may also be lower ability students, though this is not necessarily the case and we have no evidence to support it. </p>
 <p> <#> How do students select from among the various educational options outlined above? <#> Are different patterns evident among students from different social backgrounds? <#> These are the concerns of this study. </p>
 <h> <#> METHODOLOGY </h>
 <p> <#> The study is a pilot study of an exploratory nature. <#> It was limited to Irish students who entered UCC in 1989 and who had competed for their university places through the Central Admissions Office (CAO), that is, those who were awarded university degree places on the basis of 'points '. <#> We thus excluded all foreign students and mature students who are awarded places on a quota basis. <#> Information was collected from students in the classroom using an administered questionnaire. <#> We attempted complete coverage of the population to simplify data collection. </p>
 <p> <#> In faculties where first year students follow common courses, the problems of locating students were few. <#> The faculties of Arts and Science posed particular problems. <#> Science students should have proved less difficult to contact than students in Arts as all science students are required to take on or two courses in Mathematics. <#> Coverage of these two classes ought to have given us access to all first science students. As Arts students are not required to take any common subject, we selected two large classes that are timetabled back to back in first year, Sociology and French. <#> Almost 80 per cent of all first Arts students were registered for one or other of these courses and on further investigation we discovered that a high proportion of the remaining students were registered in Applied Psychology. <#> Coverage of these three classes should have provided us with access to over 90 per cent of all first Arts students. </p>
 <p> <#> Non-attendance at class proved the greatest obstacle to complete coverage and we were less successful than we had hoped in obtaining information from all the students. <#> The Arts and Science faculties were the most problematic with non-attendance of up to 25 per cent in at least one of the classes we visited. <#> In addition to non-attendance there were some students who refused to complete the questionnaire. <#> The number here were small, however, and it was non-attendance rather than refusals which account for the difference between the numbers we obtained and the numbers in the targeted population. <#> Complete coverage was obtained in Social Science, and almost complete coverage in Commerce (97 per cent). <#> The coverage in the other faculties was: Electrical Engineering 88 per cent, Medicine 87 per cent, Law 82 per cent, Dentistry 81 per cent, Civil Engineering 80 per cent, Arts 66 per cent and Science 63 per cent. <#> In all we obtained information from 77 per cent of the targeted population, which is three hundred and sixteen students short of complete coverage. <#> We feel the coverage is adequate for a pilot study. </p>
 <h> <#> THE RESULTS </h>
 <p> <#> Information was collected from 1058 students, all of whom entered UCC in 1989 and had competed for their places through the CAO. <#> Only students who had received their second level education within Ireland were included. <#> Over 70 per cent of the students were from Cork city or county; 21 per cent were from the rest of Munster, 6 per cent were from Leinster and the remainder came from Connaught and Ulster, including the six counties of Northern Ireland. <#> They ranged in age from seventeen to twenty-one. <#> The mean age was eighteen. <#> More than half the students were women (59.6 per cent). </p>
 <p> <#> The students came from all social classes (see Table 1), but as in previous studies of university entrants the higher social classes were over represented (Clancy, 1982, 1988). <#> Seventy-five per cent of our respondents came from families where the chief earner was in a non-manual job, or was a farmer with over 50 acres. <#> Twenty-eight per cent of students were in receipt of higher education grants and 1.6 per cent held scholarships. </p>
 <&> Table 1 inserted </&>
 <p> <#> Most students, then, depended on their parents to provide the finance for their education, though a small number of students supported themselves wholly or in part. <#> Over sixty percent were from families where neither parent had received third level education. </p>
 <p> <#> Previous studies of third level entrants found that students from secondary schools were more likely to enter universities than those who had been educated at community, comprehensive or vocational schools. <#> Our population displayed the same pattern. <#> Eighty-five percent of our respondents had attended secondary schools, 12 per cent had been to community or comprehensive schools, and a mere 3 per cent had been to vocational schools. <#> Almost 25 per cent of all students had attended fee paying secondary schools. <#> We did not calculate the transfer rate for each type of school but we found that 23.6 per cent of all first year entrants to UCC in 1989 had attended one of three fee paying schools in Cork city. <#> We estimate that between them these three schools cater for just under 10 per cent of the post-primary pupils in the city. <#> Further, an examination of the schools attended by students from Cork city indicate that students from non-fee paying schools in predominantly middle class areas of the city are over represented in our population. </p>
 <p> <#> We asked students to indicate the length of secondary programme they had followed, the number of times they had attempted Leaving Certificate and/or Matriculation, whether they had repeated any year during their post-primary education, the amount and type of extra tuition they had received (if any), and the subjects in which it was obtained. <#> They were also asked to indicate the cost of any coaching they had received. <#> With this information, we were able to identify the ways in which students prepared to compete for university places. </p>
 <h> <it> <#> Length of post-primary school programme </it> </h>
 <p> <#> Seventy-three percent of the students had attended schools which offered a five year post-primary programme. <#> One in five of these students, however, had spent six years at post-primary level prior to university entrance. <#> Students in five year programmes extended their stay in school in one of two ways: (1) they repeated the Leaving Certificate (68 per cent) or (2) they opted to repeat a year earlier in the post-primary programme. <#> Students who took this latter option usually repeated 5th year, though there was a small number, seven in all, who had retaken the first year in post-primary school. </p>
 <p> <#> Two hundred and seventy-seven, or 26.2 per cent of the total population, had followed a six year post-primary programme. <#> Here, too, there were students who had extended their post-primary education by at least one year. <#> The number doing so was small (33) but it amounts to 12 per cent of all students from six year programmes. <#> As with those in five year schools two methods of extending the programme were employed. <#> Two thirds of these 'seven year' students spent the extra year repeating the Leaving Certificate, the others, with one exception, repeated 5th year. </p>
 <p> <#> In all, 421 students spent six or more years at post-primary level. <#> This is 40 per cent of all first year entrants to UCC in 1989. </p>

 <h> <bold> <#> Beyond partitions </bold> </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> It will probably only be when the people of the Shankill truly believe that the violence has ended for good that we will start to see a proper assessment of the last 25 years. </bold> <#> Continuing paramilitary activity in both communities, the controversy over traditional parades and the ongoing impasse over decommissioning means that people in areas such as Protestant west Belfast remain cautious. </p>
 <p> <#> Nevertheless, since August 31 and October 13 as the weeks became months, optimism has increased in an inverse ratio to the level of tension. <#> Many people are starting to believe that perhaps it is all over. </p>
 <p> <#> Some of the changes in the community have been glaring. <#> The army has vanished from the streets. <#> The RUC now patrols the area in short sleeved shirts, without flak jackets. <#> After a lengthy campaign Lanark Way has reopened. </p>
 <p> <#> Initially it was the small things you noticed. <#> No longer did you have to enter a cage, viewed by a small camera, before being admitted into the bar for a pint. <#> Strange cars do not attract the same level of curiosity. <#> Young people returning from the clubs in the city centre are more likely to walk home than before. <#> A few shoppers from the Springfield and Falls Roads are returning to the Shankill to shop on a Saturday. </p>
 <p> <#> However this may seem to be a small return for the cessation of a terrorist campaign which cost over 3,000 lives. <#> There remains a serious community relations problem on both sides of the peaceline. <#> A problem which may well exhaust the Community Relations Council before it is solved. <#> There continues to be stoning incidents across the barriers which have been erected to keep the two sections of the community apart. </p>
 <p> <#> It is worth bearing in mind that for the last 25 years we have been inflicting the most horrific crimes on one another. <#> These wounds will not heal overnight. <#> That notwithstanding, there is an increasing determination not to step back into the abyss. <#> That, at least, is a start. <#> We will have to build from the bottom up. </p>
 <p> <#> In some ways the declaration of a cessation of violence has acted as a catalyst for a process which commenced almost one year earlier. <#> The Shankill bomb saw the birth of a determination for a new start. <#> At that time many of us thought that this would translate into a resolve not to be ground down by a traditional enemy. <#> However, with the advent of a new era in October 1994 this resolution became one of no longer being prepared to accept the role of an alienated community. <#> For a quarter of a century the Shankill had been marginalised in all but the news programmes. </p>
 <p> <#> People started emerging, blinking into the light. <#> It is now certain that Shankill residents will increasingly question the old certainties. <#> The courage and dignity with which they faced the eye of the sectarian storm can now be turned towards delivering a better life for all within the community. <#> This confidence should eventually lead directly to a normalising of relationships with our neighbours on the other side of the wall. <#> It is in the attitudes of the people of the people on the Road that the peace has had the most tangible effect. <#> There is a desire to make up for the loss of the last 25 years. <#> This new vision, while born out of the tragedy of the Shankill bomb, would have been less likely to bear fruit if it had been forced to coexist with paramilitary violence. </p>
 <p> <#> It is not in the small changes that we can see the effects of twelve months of peace. <#> Rather it is in the certainty that the great potential of the Shankill and its people may at last be fulfilled. </p>

 <h> <#> The Big Apple </h>
 <p> <#> <bold> There are few things to match the sweet flavour and crunch of home grown apples Ð whether they be eaters or cookers. <#> I like to use eaters in many desserts as they are less tart and more aromatic. <#> However, they can be difficult to puree down so a good whizz in the processor may be needed. <#> Apples combine so well with other savoury ingredients such as nuts, blackberries and elderberries for tarts, pies, puddings and crumbles or with plums, damsons, onions and tomatoes to create chutneys and relish which bring that wonderful aroma of autumn in the kitchen. <#> To preserve the flavours of apples in liquid form try apple cordial Ð not quite so potent as Joe Grundy from the Archer 's home brew. <#> As well as for drinking it 's such a good choice to use when poaching apples and berries. <#> Remember when buying apples, big does not always mean best and I find the medium sized ones have a better flavour. <#> As a rule, three apples should weigh about a pound. <#> If you can't keep up with the abundance of fruit in late autumn then apples freeze extremely well for up to six months. <#> Peel, core and slice them thickly, blanch in boiling water for just 1 minute. <#> Drain, then plunge into cold water and pack either in rigid containers or polythene bags, dusted with a little sugar. <#> Making chutney is easier than jam making, but the secret lies in long steady cooking which should never be over-boiled. <#> Cooking with CALOR GAS gives a good steady flame which is rapid and easy to regulate to ensure this even cooking. <#> Chutneys improve greatly with maturity, so store at least one month before using. <#> Enjoy the fruits of this wonderful season and remember, an apple a day keeps the doctor away as effectively in apple cordial, chutney or even baked apple sponge! </p>

 <h> <#> <bold> Apple cordial </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This mildly flavoured cordial can be stored in screw top bottlers and diluted. <#> I find it invaluable to add a concentrated apple flavour if roasting pork or duck. </p>
 <p> <#> 35kg/31b apples <#> juice of one lemon <#> 285/10 oz granulated sugar <#> 1/2 tsp citric acid <#> 570ml/1 pint water </p>
 <p> <#> Choose those firm rosy apples if you can for this cordial Ð they will give it a much nicer flavour and colour. <#> Wash and dry the apples, then chop up, but be careful to remove any blemishes which may be found on overripe apples. </p>
 <p> <#> Place in a large bowl, cover with water and lemon juice and leave to soften, stirring occasionally. <#> Cover and leave for 24 hours. </p>
 <p> <#> Transfer to a heavy based pan and simmer until the fruit becomes soft. <#> Transfer to a jelly bag or a sieve lined with muslin and strain. <#> Do not speed up the process or the cordial will become cloudy. </p>
 <p> <#> Return the strained juice to a saucepan, add the sugar and citric acid, and bring to almost boiling point and when the sugar has dissolved, leave to cool, then bottle. </p>
 <p> <#> This cordial should store in the refrigerator for up to one week. </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> Blackberry and apple pie </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Sweet Pastry: <#> 285g/10 oz plain flour <#> 55g/2oz caster sugar <#> 200g/7 oz sunflower <}> <-> margerine </-> <+> margarine </+> </}> or softened butter <#> 1 egg yolk <#> Filling: <#> 450g/1 lb cooking apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced <#> 125g/4oz blackberries <#> 55g/2oz demerara sugar <#> 1/2 tsp cinnamon or cloves <#> 2 dsp cider or apple juice or water to brush pastry <#> one egg <#> (Serves 8) </p>
 <p> <#> To make the pastry sieve the flour into a bowl, add the softened fat, cut and rub through. <#> Add the caster sugar and egg yolk to mix to a soft dough. <#> Cover the pastry with cling film and leave to relax and firm up in the fridge for at least 1/2 hour. </p>
 <p> <#> Put the apple juice, demerara sugar and spice into a saucepan and heat. <#> Add the apples and cook for 1-2 minutes stirring to coat and soften the apples. <#> Add the blackberries and leave to cool. </p>
 <p> <#> NB If the berries are ripe and full of juice then the addition of 1/2 oz cornflour to the fruit will help to prevent the pastry becoming soggy during cooking. </p>
 <p> <#> Roll out two thirds of the pastry and use to line an eight inch pie dish. <#> Brush the base of the pastry with beaten egg to seal it during cooking. <#> Add the apples and blackberries, draining off some of the juices. </p>
 <p> <#> Roll out the remaining third of pastry into a circle eight inches in diameter. <#> Brush the pastry edges with beaten egg, and place on the pastry top. <#> Seal the edges together. </p>
 <p> <#> Brush with beaten egg again and bake at 375F, 190C, gas mark 5 for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. </p>
 <p> <#> Serve dusted with caster sugar. </p>
 <p> <#> If liked the pastry for the top of this pie can be cut into narrow strips and latticed across the top. </p>
 <h> <#> <bold> Very Irish Potato Apple Cake </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This is a very traditional Irish dish, and one I often make as a comforting snack. <#> I like to serve this slightly buttered and dusted with caster sugar. <#> The cake tastes even better if you warm them in the oven until the butter is melted. </p>

 <p> <#> Into a bowl place the chopped apple, cinnamon, demerara sugar and lemon juice. <#> Cover and leave to sit, and prepare the potato cake. <#> This dish is easier to make if the potatoes are still warm. </p>
 <p> <#> Cook and finely mash the potatoes. <#> Add the salt and pepper and gradually work in the flour until the dough becomes very pliable. <#> On a floured board, roll out the dough 1/4 inch thick and cut into circles about 3 <*> inches sign </*> in diameter. </p>
 <p> <#> Cover one round with the apple mixture, damp the edge and cover with the second piece. <#> Seal the edges with a fork or pinching with your fingers. <#> Cook on the griddle until golden brown. <#> Alternatively this dish can also be cooked in the oven, gas mark 4/190C/375F for 20 minutes. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Braised Hot Pickled Red Cabbage with Apples </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> 1 medium red cabbage, shredded <#> 350g/12 oz cooking apples, peeled and sliced <#> 1 onion finely diced <#> 115g/4 oz demerara sugar <#> 570 ml/1 pint water or vegetable stock <#> 1/4 pint red wine <#> 2 dsp cider vinegar <#> 1 dsp cooking oil <#> 50g/2 oz raisins <#> pinch salt and pepper </p>
 <p> <#> In a large pan saute the onions in the oil, add the cabbage, apples, sugar, salt and pepper and toss. <#> Next add the stock, red wine, cider vinegar and stir well. <#> Place the lid on the pan and simmer gently for 60-80 minutes until tender. <#> This dish can also be braised in the oven. <#> Ten minutes before serving, add the raisins, allowing them to plump up nicely before serving hot. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Autumn Apple Chutney </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> This chutney brings the flavours of autumn together in a mouthwatering way. </p>
 <p> <#> 450g/1 lb apples, cored and diced <#> 225g/1/2 lb tomatoes chopped <#> 450g/1 lb plums, stoned and diced <#> 1 crushed clove of garlic <#> 280ml/ 1/2 pint distilled vinegar <#> 225g/ 1/2 lb demerara sugar <#> 225g/ 1/2 lb golden sultanas <#> 1 tsp each mixed spice and ginger </p>
 <p> <#> Prepare the fruits and place in an aluminium pan with all ingredients except the sugar. <#> Simmer gently for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature and add the sugar, stir until the sugar has dissolved, then simmer gently until the chutney shows signs of thickening. <#> Cool, then pack into clear, sterile jars. <#> Makes approx 4 lbs. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Baked Apple Pudding </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> One of my favourite autumn puddings, which combines the flavour of old-fashioned, simply baked apples with toasted almond sponge. </p>
 <p> <#> Vanilla sauce makes a lovely accompaniment. </p>
 <p> <#> 115g/4 oz butter or margarine <#> 115g/4 oz soft brown sugar <#> 3 eggs, lightly beaten <#> 115b/4 oz self-raising flour <#> 85g/3 oz lightly toasted ground almonds <#> 8-10 whole cloves <#> 4-6 small rosy eating apples <#> rind of one lemon </p>
 <p> <#> To make the cake mixture, cream the fat and sugar until soft and fluffy. <#> Whisk the eggs into the butter and sugar lightly but thoroughly, a little at a time. </p>
 <p> <#> Whisk in the grated lemon rind and mix in the toasted ground almonds, cloves and self-raising flour. </p>
 <p> <#> Transfer to a lightly greased serving dish and arrange the apples in the sponge mixture, then bake at 180C/350F Gas Mark 4 for 25-30 mins until cooked. <#> Serve hot with vanilla sauce. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> Vanilla Sauce </bold> <h>
 <p> <#> 1 vanilla pod or few drops of vanilla extract <#> 30g/1 oz caster sugar <#> 4 egg yolks <#> 570ml/1 pint milk </p>
 <p> <#> Place the vanilla pod with the sugar and leave the flavour to impart (at least 30 mins). <#> As an alternative, a few drops of vanilla extract can be added to the sugar and left for the same length of time. <#> Beat the eggs and sugar together until smooth and creamy. <#> Warm the milk in a saucepan and pour over the eggs. <#> Mix well and return to the saucepan. </p>
 <p> <#> Over a very gentle heat stir until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. <#> It is important to keep the temperature low during the making of this sauce, otherwise it will curdle. <#> Serve warm. </p>

 <p> <#> Dear Minister,</p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> The Future Structure of the National University of Ireland
  Introduction </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> When the representatives of the University were received by you on 23 January 1990, you confirmed that consideration of future structures could proceed on the basis that, whatever choice was made, there would be no diminution of autonomy in relation to appointments and the general conduct of university business. <#> You suggested that the University 's preferred option should be brought forward as soon as possible. </p>
 <p> <#> It is now possible to summarise the outcome of the consideration given to the matter by the three Constituent Colleges, St Patrick 's College, Maynooth (a Recognised College) and the Senate of the University. <#> The reports of the four Colleges are given in full in the Appendix to this letter. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> General approach </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Despite differences as to the extent and degree of change desired, it is the common preference of the four Colleges to remain constituent elements of a NUI system but each with the status and title of a university and a significant redistribution in its favour of powers and functions. <#> This would mean that, while the corpus of existing legislation, charters and statutes would be preserved, amendments would need to be effected by new legislation with the principal object of transferring certain powers and functions at present exercised by the Senate of NUI to the appropriate bodies of the constituent universities, with the Senate retaining residual responsibilities regarding appointments procedures and standards of degrees and diplomas. <#> The following paragraphs set out the consensus arrived at by the Senate on particular aspects of this general approach. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Status and Title </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> (i)The present three Constituent Colleges, while retaining all their existing powers and functions, should become constituent universities of the National University of Ireland and be entitled in Irish and English, respectively: <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Baile &/Atha Claith </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Dublin <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Corcaigh </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Cork <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Gaillimh </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Galway </p>
 <p> <#> (ii) St Patrick 's College, Maynooth, in its faculties or arts, celtic studies, philosophy and science, should become a constituent university of the National University of Ireland and be entitled in Irish and English, respectively:
 <&Irish> <#> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, M&/a Nuad </&Irish> <#> The National University of Ireland, Maynooth
 <p> <#> Appropriate provision should be made for representation of the Senate of NUI on the Governing Body and vice-versa. </p>
 <p> <#> (iii) The constituent universities may extend the above titles in a manner which indicates that they are successors to a specified Constituent or Recognised College or that they are constituent universities of the National University of Ireland. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Transfer of Power and Functions </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> (i) Provision should be made specifically in legislation for the amendment of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, and associated Charters so as to effect the transfer of powers and functions from the Senate of the NUI to the appropriate bodies of the respective constituent universities which is described below under the headings of Appointments, and Courses and Standards for Degrees and Diplomas. </p>
 <p> <#> (ii) Provision should also be made for flexibility in authorising future agreed evolution of the relations between the NUI and its constituent universities. <#> This could be achieved by providing that further changes in powers and functions proposed by the NUI on the recommendation or with the agreement of the constituent university(ies) could be statutorily authorised, subject to ratification (passive or active) by both Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Internal Procedures </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> To afford them operational flexibility, constituent universities should be empowered (notwithstanding any restriction in existing legislation) to make by way of university statute, after consultation with the Senate of NUI, such changes as might be decided by the relevant Governing Body in the internal organisation or procedures of that university. <#> Such statute should have effect when it had lain before both Houses of the Oireachtas for a prescribed period without being annulled. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Appointments </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> (i) Persons who at present hold posts in the Colleges which are to become constituent universities, whether appointed thereto by the relevant College authority or by the Senate of the NUI, should be confirmed as holders of equivalent posts, without disimprovement in terms, conditions or entitlements, in the relevant constituent universities. </p>
 <p> <#> (ii) Persons who hold permanent academic posts to which they were appointed by the Governing Body of a Constituent College, should become lecturers of the relevant constituent university and, without prejudice to grades or salary scales, enjoy the advantages possessed by lecturers appointed by the Senate of the NUI, as regards tenure, membership of the Academic Council and the holding of any other office or responsibility in the constituent university. </p>
 <p> <#> (iii) Each constituent university should have the power to appoint its own staff but, in relation to permanent academic staff, including the President, and academic staff appointed for a fixed term of years, appointments should be made only in accordance with such appointments procedure as might be approved from time to time by the Senate of the NUI either generally or in particular categories or cases. <#> These appointments should be provisional for the first month and then become effective unless within the month an objection, on the basis of alleged non-conformity with the approved procedure, were made by an interested party to the relevant Governing Body, and reported to the Registrar of NUI. <#> Pending resolution of the objection (within, say, two months at the outside), the appointment should remain provisional. <#> (The basic element in the appointments procedure to be approved by the Senate of the NUI would be an appropriately constituted assessment board including an external expert or external experts). </p>
 <p> <#> (iv) Persons who, in accordance with paragraphs (i) - (iii) above, hold appointments as Professors, Readers or Lecturers in constituent universities shall also, so long as they hold these appointments, be Professors, Readers or Lecturers, respectively, of the National University of Ireland. </p>
 <p> <#> (v) The functions of the Senate of NUI regarding removal from office of persons to whom paragraphs (i) - (iii) refer should pass to the relevant constituent universities, subject to the right of appeal to the Visitor. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Courses and Standards for Degrees and Diplomas </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The constituent universities should establish their own degree and diploma courses, set their own marks and standards and, in consultation with the relevant external examiners, set their own examinations. <#> The courses so established would be subject, from time to time, to review by an academic committee of the Senate of NUI, after consultation with the relevant external examiners. <#> Any comments resulting from such periodic review would be communicated to the constituent universities for their consideration. <#> The present General Board of Studies should be abolished. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> External Examiners </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> External examiners should continue to be appointed by the Senate of NUI on the agreed recommendation of the constituent universities, with appropriate functions, including the additional function indicated in the preceding paragraph, but with flexibility as to the manner of discharging these functions. </p>
 <h><ul> <bold> <#> Degrees and Diplomas </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The degrees and diplomas awarded by the constituent universities should be degrees and diplomas of the National University of Ireland and should be so designated. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Entrance requirements for students </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> The Senate should continue to approve basic matriculation conditions for the NUI system as a whole. <#> The constituent universities would be free to prescribe additional requirements for entry to particular faculties. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Recognised Colleges </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Provision should continue to exist for third-level educational establishments to be associated with a constituent university and to be designated as Recognised Colleges of the NUI. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Theology (or Religious Studies) </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Abolition is recommended of those provisions of Section 7 of the 1908 Act which prohibit the public funding of 'any theological or religious teaching or study' and, even where private funding is involved, lay down other restrictions. </p>
 <h> ><ul> <bold> <#> Finance </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Funding of the NUI itself (as distinct from the constituent universities) should be mainly by the charging of appropriate fees (e.g. in relation to matriculation, degrees and diplomas). <#> Supplemental public funding should be provided for. </p>
 <h> <ul> <bold> <#> Effect of Proposals </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> These proposals would confer the status and title of universities on U.C.D., U.C.C., U.C.G., and St. Patrick 's College, Maynooth, and transfer to them wide-ranging discretion to conduct their own affairs. <#> The National University of Ireland, which has played a historically significant role in national education and development, would continue to provide an important public service. <#> In its co-ordinating role the NUI, acting through its head-office and its Senate, would be concerned with the maintenance of appropriate university entrance standards and the highest international standing for degrees and diplomas. <#> It would also provide assurance of impartiality and excellence in academic appointments and would be a forum for consideration of developmental policies in education in Ireland and in the evolving European Community. </p>
 <h> ><ul> <bold> <#> Conclusion </ul> </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> It is hoped that the proposals will commend themselves to you and the Government and that a decision will be taken to introduce legislation accordingly to amend the 1908 Act and associated Charters. <#> Officers of the University are considering the particular amendments required and will be glad to assist in the formulation of appropriate heads of a bill. </p>
 <p> <#> It would be appreciated if representatives of the University could have a preliminary meeting with you soon for any clarification you may desire and for a general discussion of the proposals. </p>
 <p> <#> Yours sincerely, <#> Kenneth Whitaker <#> Chancellor </p>

IrishEnglish,should,To determine how much water you will need you should allow 230 litres (50 gallons) of water a day for each person in your household,deontic,deontic,deontic,<W2B-037$A>,"
 <h> <bold> <#> Enfo <#> - promoting care of the environment <#> GROUNDWATER </bold> </h>
 <p> <bold> <#> Did you know that 99.5 <*> per cent sign </*> of the world's water cannot be used because it is either saline or is locked up in glaciers and ice sheets? <#> Most of the remaining water is present in rocks as groundwater and less than 0.01 <*> per cent sign </*> is present in rivers and lakes. <#> In many parts of the world where rivers and lakes are either absent or are polluted, groundwater is often the only source of fresh water. <#> In Ireland about 25 <*> per cent sign </*> of the water we use comes from groundwater and this figure will undoubtedly rise as we become more developed. <#> Groundwater is a resource that we need to protect because once it is polluted it cannot be used for many years. </p>
 <h> <#> WHAT IS GROUND WATER? </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> Groundwater is part of the hydrological or watercycle (Diagram 1). <#> The cycle begins with water evaporating from the oceans and forming clouds. <#> When the clouds cool - such as when they rise over mountains - the water is released as rainfall. <#> Some of the rain is evaporated or is used by plants and goes straight back into the atmosphere. <#> Some flows directly into rivers and streams and from there flows back into the oceans and some percolates through the soil and into the underlying rocks - the water in the rocks is groundwater. </p>
 <&> Diagram inserted </&>
 <p> <#> Once in the rock the water moves slowly through the pores or cracks and emerges at ground level by coming out at springs or by flowing into rivers. </p>
 <p> <#> A body of rock which contains appreciable quantities of water is called an 'aquifier'. <#> The 'water table' in a aquifier is the level below which the pores or cracks are completely filled with water - the saturated zone. <#> Above the water table - the unsaturated zone - the pores are filled with both air and water. <#> In many parts of Ireland 'perched' water tables exist where impermeable material (material which will not allow water through), such as boulder clay, overlies an aquifier. <#> In these situations water cannot get through and you get two watertables, one in the soil and one in the aquifier beneath. </p>
 <p> <#> You can bring groundwater to the surface by drilling into saturated rock and pumping the water out. <#> The amount of water that can be extracted depends on the number and size of the pores in the rock. <#> If the rock is 'tight', such as granite, little water can be pumped out but if the pores or cracks are numerous and large, such as in fissured limestone, you can extract useful amounts of water. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> A MAJOR POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT </bold> <h>
 <p> <#> Approximately 1,140 mm of rain falls in Ireland each year of which about 360 mm percolates through the soil and into groundwater (this is called 'groundwater recharge'). <#> The amounts of groundwater recharge vary in Ireland, with most in the north-west (513 mm per year) and least in the south (350 mm per year). </p>
 <p> <#> 50 <*> per cent sign </*> of Ireland's groundwater is considered 'developable' meaning that we could extract it relatively easily. <#> At present we extract less than 2 <*> per cent sign </*> of the developable groundwater and of this, public bodies use 36 <*> per cent sign </*>, industry uses 37 <*> per cent sign </*> and the remainder is used for rural domestic supplies. <#> Most groundwater is extracted in the east of the country and least in the west and north-west. <#> Some midland and western counties have a very high dependence on groundwater - County Roscommon, for example, uses groundwater for about 80 <*> per cent sign </*> of its water supply. </p>
 <h> <bold> <#> WHY GROUNDWATER NEEDS PROTECTION </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> In general the quality of Irish groundwater is good but because we have no national survey of groundwater, like An Foras Forbartha's national survey of rivers and lakes, it is difficult to accurately assess groundwater quality. </p>
 <p> <#> Although it is usually more difficult to pollute groundwater than rivers and lakes (because the soil can either stop the pollutant reaching groundwater or help to reduce its concentration) many of our activities can have an impact on groundwater quality. <#> All too frequently we have adopted an attitude of 'out of sight, out of mind' and this has resulted in groundwater being polluted and wells having to be abandoned. <#> Because groundwater moves slowly, once it is polluted it can remain so for many years. </p>
 <p> <#> In rural areas septic tanks and farmyard activities can pollute groundwater while in and around urban areas refuse dumps would be just one source of contamination. </p>
 <p> <#> A septic tank consists of a watertight container which separates liquids from solids and provides a limited amount of organic digestion, and some sort of soakage system for disposal of the liquid overflow. <#> Because the effluent from septic tanks is not fully treated it can cause pollution. </p>
 <p> <#> If you have a septic tank and it is polluting the water in your well it is probably because the tank is located too close to the well. <#> Your septic tank can also pollute groundwater if it is situated in an area where the soil is too thin or too waterlogged to allow proper soakage of the effluent. <#> Problems of pollution may also arise if you have used a soakage pit filled with stones rather than a proper pipe distribution system or if you do not empty your tank regularly. <#> Diagram 2 shows a layout for a septic tank that minimises groundwater pollution. </p>
 <&> Diagram inserted </&>
 <p> <#> The use of silage for winter feeding has increased dramatically in Ireland over the last 20 years. <#> When you make silage, an effluent with a great potential for pollution is generated. <#> Unless you put a concrete slab beneath the silage and drains at the sides to collect the effluent, pollution of groundwater and rivers and lakes can occur. </p>
 <p> <#> Dungheaps in farmyards can cause similar problems to those described for the silage and you need to take similar precautions to prevent pollution. </p>
 <p> <#> In urban areas one of the greatest threats to groundwater quality is that posed by refuse dumps. <#> Each one of us generates about a quarter of a tonne of refuse each year which has to be disposed of - usually by landfill. </p>
 <p> <#> Domestic refuse generates a noxious leachate when water is passed through the landfill. <#> This leachate can cause severe pollution of groundwater unless the landfill is located in a suitable area and designed and managed properly. </p>
 <p> <#> To avoid pollution of groundwater, dumps need to be located where there is a thick unsaturated zone so that the leachate can be reduced in concentration before it reaches groundwater. <#> The thickness of the unsaturated zone depends on the type of material beneath the dump - thicker in sands and gravels than in clays. <#> Also, after each day's dumping the refuse should be covered with material which won't allow water into the refuse, because the more water you allow into the refuse the more leachate you generate. </p>
 <p> <#> Even where there is a thick unsaturated zone and where you cover the refuse daily some contamination of the groundwater will occur. <#> It is imperative that we locate refuse disposal sites only in areas where the groundwater resources have been proven to be of no great importance. </p>
 <p> <#> In addition to refuse dumps, leaky sewers, leaking underground storage containers and accidental spillages have caused pollution of groundwater beneath urban areas (Diagram 3). </p>
 <&> Diagram inserted </&>
 <h> <bold> <#> GETTING A SUPPLY OF GROUNDWATER </bold> </h>
 <p> <#> If you are not part of a water supply scheme and are considering a source of water then you might consider digging or boring a well and extracting groundwater. <#> The accompanying chart shows the steps involved in getting a supply of groundwater. </p>
 <p> <#> To determine how much water you will need you should allow 230 litres (50 gallons) of water a day for each person in your household. <#> The requirement for your livestock varies from about 140 litres (30 gallons) a day for a dairy cow to about 20 litres (4 gallons) a day for 100 chickens. <#> Having determined the total daily requirement you should then see what your peak usage would be because it is this that your well will have to yield without going dry. <#> It is recommended that your hourly well yield be at least one sixth of your daily needs. </p>
 <p> <#> Traditionally people have gone to water diviners to find out if there is groundwater beneath their land. <#> Although a water diviner <it> may </it> be able to indicate where you should drill he will not be able to tell you how deep you will have to drill or how much water you are likely to get. <#> This information can be obtained from the Geological Survey and has the added advantage of being free of charge! </p>
 <p> <#> The type of well you use will depend to a large extent on the depth to the permanent watertable and you can check this out easily using a mechanical excavator. <#> If you have to use a bored well check out the reputation of the well driller with those of your neighbours who have had wells drilled by him and make sure you get a written contract that specifies the terms and conditions of the drilling agreement. </p>
 <p> <#> Once the well is drilled and the yield tested, the well should be sealed against pollution (Diagram 4) and disinfected. <#> A few days after disinfection you should send a sample of water from the well to the local Health Board for analysis. <#> The driller should send copies of the borehole log and the results of the well test to the Geological Survey. <#> The results of the water analysis should also be sent to the Geological Survey. <#> This information helps them to build up a regional picture of groundwater quality and quantity and so helps the next person coming along looking for information. </p>
 <&> Diagram inserted </&>
 <p> <#> The water quality problems you are likely to encounter include hardness (lime) and iron and iron bacteria. <#> These problems are fairly easy to solve and the Geological Survey will be able to help you if you encounter such problems. </p>

 <h> <ul> <#> Preparing an Italian Spinone </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> How to start the task of preparing your Spinone. <#> First of all start with a clean dog. <#> Yes, he can have a bath! <#> This should be done a week before the show. <#> Beard and legs can be rinsed the night before <#> For hand stripping your dog the best tool and the cheapest of course, is finger and thumb, a good stripping comb and thinning scissors. <#> NEVER USE STRAIGHT SCISSORS </p>
 <h> <#> THE HEAD: </h> <p> <#> Start with the head. <#> The skull and occiput should be short and smooth. <#> Gently strip towards the back skull and from the outer corner of the eyes to the beginning of the cheek. <#> The eyebrow should be combed through, then gently strip out any over hanging brow. <#> I have never found it necessary to trim the beard. <#> If you use a fine comb regularly this keeps it in trim. <#> However, this can be kept tidy with thinning scissors. <#> EARS must also be kept tidy. <#> They are set on level with the eyes, triangular in shape, slightly rounded at the tip, hanging no more than two inches at the jaw line. <#> You can have a surplus of two inches or more hanging from the ears - this needs to come off. </p>
 <h> <ul> <#> THE NECK: </ul> </h> <p> <#> The Spinone is known for growing a lion 's ruff around the neck and shoulders. <#> If this is not stripped out this can give the impression of no neck at all. <#> Hand strip down the neck and shoulders. <#> The dewlap should also be clean and tidy. <#> Continue down from the shoulderblades and onto the back towards the tail. </p>
 <h> <#> THE TAIL: </h> <p> <#> The tail should be carried out or down. <#> If your Spinone carries his tail high the last thing <}> <+> you </+> </}> want to see is a flag hanging from it. </p>
 <h> <#> LEGS: </h> <p> <#> Forelegs should be straight, bone oval, strong well defined tendons. <#> Elbows neither turning in or out, pasterns slightly sloping when viewed from the side. <#> If your Spinone has got all this why cover it with excess hair and fringing? <#> The Standard says the coat should be shorter on the front of the limbs and on the feet. <#> The same goes for the hindquarters. <#> Particular attention should be made to keeping the elbows and hocks tidy, also the stifle. <#> The Standard does not ask for exaggeration on this point, so again long fringing should not be left on. <#> This includes the underline which should not be fringed excessively. <#> Finally feet - front compact and round, hindfeet slightly oval, toes arched, covered with short hair especially between the toes. <#> Nails strong and arched. <#> If you find this area difficult to strip out it can be done with thinning scissors. </p>
 <p> <#> The preparation of your Spinone should not be done in haste. <#> Do a little at a time so he does not get bored and you don't make the mistake of taking off too much. <#> The end result will be worth it. <#> By LINDA COLLINS (WYNSETT) </p>

 <p> <#> Congress would like to draw your attention to a number of key points in the new Act. <#> Also, we would like to alert you to a recent negative trend in pensions practice which should be brought to the attention of trade union officials involved in pension negotiations. </p>
 <h> (i) <ul> <#> Worker Trustees </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> The Minister for Social Welfare is committed to introducing Regulations for the appointment of member trustees by January 1994. <#> However, in the meantime every effort should be made to convince employers that progress can and should be made before that date. <#> In the absence of member trustees, Unions should seek the establishment and recognition of <ul> Pension Committees </ul> with provision for appropriate training for Committee members. </p>
 <h> (ii) <ul> <#> Pensions Board </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> In the event of a dispute with the trustees of a scheme or with an employer over the provisions of the Pensions Act, the application of the rules of the scheme or where malpractice is suspected, the Union can now refer the dispute to the Pensions Board which has a statutory duty to investigate the matter and propose and implement remedies. </p>
 <h> (iii) <ul> <#> Dilution of Pension Benefits; 'Defined Contribution Scheme' </ul> </h>
 <p> <#> It has come to the attention of Congress that some employers have been
 attempting to convert the normal occupational pension scheme known as a 'defined
 benefit scheme' to another less favourable form of scheme i.e. a 'defined contribution
 scheme'. <#> It must be pointed out that this is motivated solely to <ul> escape the
 provisions of the Pensions Act </ul> and in almost every conceivable case a 'defined
 contribution scheme' will be <ul> less </ul> favourable in terms of members' benefit
 than a 'defined benefit scheme'. <#> Congress is advising union negotiators to oppose
 this development and advise scheme members to refuse in writing to accept the
 winding up of their existing scheme, and to refer the matter to the Pensions Board.
 </p>

    the Party and the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy 
    Affairs, who, according to him, were his good friends.
""Are you sure you can see these people on my behalf?"" 
    Kanu had eagerly enquired.
""Sum men!"" he confirmed in 
    American slang.
""I'll be very grateful if you could introduce me to 
    them so that I could be recognised as the traditional 
    ruler"".
Well, men, you gonna do something 
    quickly, you know - you see warer I 
    mean"".
""Okay, what do you think would go as kola and dash?"" 
    Kanu requested.
""Since I now know you are serious, let us talk business. 
    You see, I would be having tea with the National President of our 
    Great Party in his residence at seven o'clock this evening. We 
    are going to plan a new strategy for the forthcoming general 
    elections and I can seize the opportunity to discuss your matter 
    with him. The Commissioner would also be there...""
""Good, what do I do?""
""You have to lobby harder than the other contestants. They 
    had already approached me on the same issue, but I never gave them 
    my promise since I have you in mind.
""I am prepared to lobby with one thousand naira...""
""You ate not serious. Do you think you are in the United. 
    States where lobby has a different meaning from what it is known in 
    Nigeria? If you are serious, the minimum is ten thousand naira. and 
    as you know ten percent of it would go to the Patty's coffer 
    as kickback"".
'Al-right,""
""When do I collect it? the sooner the better for 
    you"".
""This evening...""
""See you then.""
And so, when Chief Emela was crowned the traditional ruler of 
    Umuoke, many distinguished personalities, including Mazi Ogaranya, 
    were conferred with chieftaincy titles in appreciation of their 
    'transparent honesty and untiring efforts to bring development 
    to Umnuoke autonomous community"".
Mazi was really a factor to be reckoned with politically and 
    because of his expanded chains of business enterprises, he 
    preferred an independent life to holding any elective post. He had 
    ten limited liability companies each independent of the other 
    although with common aims and objectives. Because of his political 
    influence. Mazi Ogaranya enjoyed party patronage, perhaps to 
    compensate him for his devotion to the Party's cause.
The City Electrical and Electronics (Nigeria) Limited won the 
    two hundred million naira rural electrification contract. The 
    contract was abandoned after one hundred and twenty million naira 
    mobilization fee had been paid. Of the amount, the Party received 
    five million naira kick-back. The 'Water Works (Nigeria) 
    Limited was awarded the fifty million naira contract to supply 
    water to a new layout without any tender not to talk of applying 
    for it. Thirty million naira mobilization fee was paid and out of 
    the lot, the party had one point five million naira kick-back. A 
    few pipes were laid after some economic trees had been destroyed 
    The job was abandoned a few weeks after receiving the mobilization 
    fee.
Each of the ten companies received party patronage in a big way. 
    Every company acquired many plots without paying the normal 
    registration fee.
The Afro Construction Company Ltd. an arm of the chains 
    of business that specialised in buildings was awarded the contract 
    to build more than seventy percent of low income houses in Aba, 
    Umuahia, Okigwe, Orlu and Owerri. It also handled many units of 
    same type of buildings scattered in almost all the post-primary 
    institutions in the state as teachers' quarters. The contract 
    was negotiated dining a cock-tail party in honour of a visiting 
    party stalwart from a neighbouring state. The contract agreement 
    was signed leer a mobilization fee of one point five million naira 
    had been paid into the company's coffer with fifty thousand 
    naira kickback So the party.
The Chairman of all the group of companies, Mazi Ogaranya gave 
    appointments to many people, especially beautiful girls. There were 
    those whose major schedule of duties was to serve tea to the Senior 
    Officers. Management members could employ messengers, cleaners and 
    labourers only while the Chairman/Managing Director employed 
    clerical staff of all grades. Some of the appointments were made in 
    the hotels and party rallies. At any rate, all appointments were 
    ratified by the Administrative Manager who also acted as the 
    Secretary to the Group of Companies.
Many young boys and girls had left the rural areas for brighter 
    and more challenging life in the cities. They had heard many 
    stories of life in the cities, easy employment, easier way of 
    making money than in the villages, disco clubs, streets lined with 
    gold and what-have-you. Many teenage girls had found employments in 
    hotels run and organised by Party loyalists. Some had found jobs in 
    Party offices while many others roamed about the streets and 
    offices looking for any type of employment.
Mazi Ogaranya's chain of business enterprises gave 
    employment to many girls who in turn were expected to keep to the 
    Group's motto of 'Kindness gives birth to kindness'. 
    It was no secret that the Managing Director expected those 
    beautiful 'things' in his companies to 
    'service' him at will without grumbling. The Executive 
    Officers also had 'eyes' on the beauties but could not 
    penetrate deep for fear of being disciplined by the Managing 
    Director.
One of such beauties was Ngozi, a receptionist in one of the 
    companies. She had been tried by all the men who were men in the 
    companies and they found her tough and principled. The Chairman had 
    invited her one Friday morning for a chat. On that particular day, 
    Ngozi was very impressively dressed. Her hair-do was superb. Her 
    gown, which never went beyond the knee cap and gathered around the 
    waist, added more weight to her dancing buttocks. The open chest 
    gown told tales of romance. Her round face with nice little red 
    painted-soft-lips and searching eyes brought down to earth the 
    Managing Director's wandering memory.
She was a hypnotist!
""Good morning sir"".
""Ah, the greatest daughter of Africa, sit down and how is 
    life treating you?
""Fine, thank you"".
""What's the name again?""
""Ngozi...""
Ah...Ngorbabe""
""Thank you sir"".
""Forget about sir' when you are in my office. We are 
    here on a different frequency all together - okay?""
""But sir
'Look, Ngor, you are the most durable personality I have 
    ever come across, the light of the world, the cool evening breeze 
    that restores life to the dying, green vegetation that gives 
    natural beauty to a city...""
""Am sorry sir, I do not and will not merit all the praises 
    you've showered on me. They belong to the Almighty God who is 
    durable and gives life to the dying...""
""Well, don't misunderstand me because, as you've 
    noticed. I love you so much that without you by my side always, my 
    life will be gone and useless....""
""Am sorry sir, I...I...I mean I don't understand 
    you"".
Ngozi stammered as she fumbled with the little handbag she had 
    placed on the executive table.
""I see. Well what's your time table for this evening? 
    I ask this because I expect some V.I.Ps in my house 
    this evening and I have listed your name as one of those who would 
    serve them, you know"".
""Incidentally sir, I have crowded programmes for this 
    evening and tomorrow also, I am going to have a busy 
    weekend...""
""I see, are you expecting your B. F. for the 
    week-end...?
""Sorry sir. I don't understand you""
""I mean will your boyfriend be around this evening?
""Not at all sir, and incidentally I have only 
    'JESUS' as my boyfriend. We have Bible Studies this 
    evening. One of our members is wedding tomorrow and I am her Chief 
    Bridesmaid. On Sunday, we'll all follow the new couple to the 
    church and what follows after the thanks-giving service may also 
    take the greater part of the day"".
""You are a Pastor, I guess?""
""I am not, nor do I hope to be one unless it is the will of 
    JESUS that I should serve Him up to that level for who am 
    Ito disobey my Saviour'? Jonah 
    of all people tried it and found out that it paid him no dividend 
    to kick his foot against the rock...."".
""Thank you for your preaching. I am happy to hear from you 
    that you cannot disobey heavenly order. Wait until you go to that 
    your fabulous heaven but as long as you are in this world and in my 
    company, any instruction or order that I give MUST, repeat MUST be 
    carried out
""I quite agree with you sir provided the instruction or 
    order does not conflict with my private life.""
""Is that what you have to say to me, pretty girl? Never 
    mind for I'll take very good care of your private life. In 
    fact it is your private and not the official one, that I want. You 
    are my staff and I am your employer, therefore a farmer is entitled 
    to eat the food from his own farmland to borrow the language of 
    your bible.
""I wouldn't subscribe to that theory of a farmer 
    you've just propounded. I am here to serve the company based 
    on my own schedule of duties and anything outside that am afraid 
    may not be met with...""
""It's all right Ngozi! There is no more long grammar 
    there. The instruction is clear. I want you in my house this 
    evening at six. I will certainly pay you extra for that. I mean 
    you'll love a repeat performance on your own for your reward 
    will be very great. After all, I am going to promote you from 
    salary grade level 05 to grade level 08 for your dedication to 
    duty. I will also give you, free of charge, a well furnished two 
    bedroom flat at the Aladinma Housing Estate. Besides these, 
    you'll have a car loan, big enough to buy any car of your 
    choice"".
""Oh! you are very great sir. This shows that you really 
    love me. I am very grateful for that. But you see, earthly things 
    cannot and will never make me go contrary to my belief. As a 
    Christian, it is my belief that one day, God will send a friend, a 
    husband to me. He may be very poor, poorer than a church rat. it 
    does not matter because with 'JESUS' by our side we shall 
    move in the way of the Lord. I am a woman. I agree, but wish to 
    remind you that I am not like the rest of other girls who are after 
    worldly things. I do not say I hate money. I do not say I hate 
    cars. I do not say I hate to live in furnished flat. All these 
    things are good. If it is the will of God. I shall get them through 
    the right way in the name of JESUS. Amen!...""
""Local preacher, I see. The whole thing is now simple. It 
    is either you obey the instruction and be better than you are today 
    or lose your job...""
""I'll rather lose my job than lose my soul. I hereby 
    resign my appointment with immediate effect.""
Ngozi walked Out of the office, wrote her resignation letter, 
    handed it over to the Personnel Manager and left the office after 
    saying 'good bye to her colleagues.
As soon as the Personnel Manager read the letter, he called for 
    Ngozi's file. In the absence of one month's notice Ngozi 
    gave a month's salary as contained in the company's 
    scheme of service. The Personnel Manager accepted the resignation. 
    He took the file to the Chairman for his information. Mazi Ogaranya 
    wasn't happy when he saw that the Personnel Manager had 
    accepted the resignation and had closed her file. He wanted her to 
    be dismissed but the Manager had a different view.

NigerianEnglish,may,This is not to say that we are unaware of the divisions in the camps of the militias (born-again or not) that may have led to the conflicting statements regarding the existence of MEND or relevance of the Aaron Team from the men-of-the-creeks,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,bl_52,"Dear President Yar’Adua,
“Always deal with the man at the top!”…Chris M. Okolie
Dear President Yar’Adua,
This writer broke his writing-milk-teeth working with a 
    little-sung icon of the Nigerian press, Christopher Maduaburochukwu 
    Okolie; the young man who dared to import classy full-colour gloss 
    into the realm of Nigerian media (which was hitherto dominated by 
    the “dreary” but popular Spear and Drum magazines) with his 
    revolutionary “NEWBREED” magazine (with the delectable Ms. 
    Gloria Rhodes gracing its debut 1972 cover).
Chris Okolie introduced, with the advent of NEWBREED, a bold 
    genre of investigative and bold journalism that unveiled the 
    hitherto untouchable world of corrupt military politics in Nigeria, 
    and was precursor of the NEWSWATCHs, TELLs, et al, of today. Of 
    course, he paid for his ground-breaking daring, when he earned the 
    wrath of OBJ in that General’s his first coming, following General 
    Murtala Mohammed’s death!
General Obasanjo placed NEWBREED in the history books by 
    proscribing it in 1978 (the first proscription of a publication 
    since Nigeria gained independence in 1960), for having featured a 
    series of probing articles and unconventional interviews that had 
    culminated in one edition that featured both an exposé of the 
    nascent-NSO (the National Security Organisation, that later birthed 
    the SSS, NIA, et al, Nigeria’s alphabet of “intelligence” agencies) 
    by this writer; which the government claimed was seditious because 
    it had published the name and photograph of the army officer who 
    then headed the abusive NSO.
With the gusto of youthful exuberance, Okolie’s crew of bright 
    young ingénues (which also included Pat Utomi, Atedo Peterside, 
    Chris Ogbechie, Tex Egbedi, to name only a few) went about, even 
    pre-OBJ, gleefully treading on toes and fingers of the rich and 
    powerful in Nigeria (leading, for example, to General Yakubu Gowon 
    sacking erudite Professor Adedeji, after this gentleman unwisely 
    indicted himself in a NEWBREED interview).
One often wonders whether Chris’ crew wouldn’t have done a 
    better job at keeping on their toes, this unbelievably more-corrupt 
    3rd Republic actors with their incessant “demonstration of craze” 
    (apologies to the inimitable Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, who himself 
    really only became Nigeria’s greatest musical export following the 
    street-savvy marketing of him nationwide by our self-same Chris 
    Okolie!), than what our current crop of Nigerian media journalists 
    (many of whom have been impoverished into being themselves 
    sometimes easily corrupted by the system)!
Of course, before (and after) NEWBREED, Nigeria has had great 
    journalists; premier among whom (and still alive, thank God!) were 
    Peter Enahoro and Sam Amuka-Pemu (whose sobriquets, “Peter Pan” and 
    “Sad Sam”, were household names. Others have included the great Ray 
    Ekpus, Dele Giwas, Bukar Zarmas, Muyiwa Adetibas, Haroun Adamus, 
    Nduka Obaigbenas; the very enchanting Bunmi Sofolas, Funmi Iyandas 
    and Helen Ovbiagelis; and, not forgetting the Dele Momodus, Amah 
    Ogans, Ibim Semenitaris, Owei Lakemfas and Mideno Bayagbons.
But…back to Chris Okolie; the man many elite Nigerians loved to 
    hate through the late 1960s to the late 1990s…both for his uncanny 
    ability to expose their quirks and weaknesses, and for the fact 
    that he was supposedly a “social upstart” who had ruthlessly 
    ascended the rungs of power from out of the lowest levels of 
    society, attaining heights of power that made him relevant in the 
    nation’s social, political and economic landscape…even winning, in 
    marriage, the hand of the much-sought-after gracious Mabel Ibru of 
    the Ibru dynasty.
Through all these, Chris’ major visible concession to 
    hierarchies was captured in the simple dictum Chris taught every 
    editorial and marketing staff of his now-defunct NEWBREED Group 
    (which also published Nigeria’s premier business magazine, THE 
    PRESIDENT, and NEW TIMES), viz., “Always deal with the man 
    at the top”.
Using this simple maxim, Chris’ NEWBREED irrepressible crew 
    ferreted out well-investigated scandal after scandal (including the 
    one that gave “life” to Nigeria’s colourful politician, Godwin 
    Daboh, through the infamous “If you Daboh me, I will Tarka you” 
    saga). Isn’t it just like Nigeria, that when this icon of the media 
    passed on in his middle-age, a couple of years ago, very few 
    journals noted, or reported, his demise…?
Whether they did, or not, matters little to Chris, or this 
    writer, now. What matters is the maxim of “always deal with the man 
    at the top”.
It is that maxim of Chris’ (i.e., “always deal 
    with the man at the top”) that leads one to pen this missive to you 
    today, Mr. President, because you are “the man at the top”, 
    where Nigeria is concerned…or, are you? Are you really the “the man 
    at the top” in Nigeria? Can you, Alhaji Umoru Musa Yar’Adua, 
    honestly say that you are the sole man at the top as far as 
    national affairs are concerned? Some of your aides and ministers 
    seem to think otherwise, Mr. President!
Or will you say that you are unaware of the mixed signals that 
    some of your lieutenants often give in this regard; making fools of 
    most of us “loyalists” of yours who believe that the buck of 
    executive power ends on your desk? Have you not heard some of your 
    men and women (ministers, advisers et al) make public proclamations 
    that run contrary to stated positions (public or private) of 
    yours?
Please do not say that you are so disconnected from our national 
    reality that you are oblivious to the fact, for example, that 
    General Godwin Abbe’s macho braggadocio and dictatorial words are 
    becoming more and more inimical to the expedited attainment of your 
    administration’s goal of sustainable peace in the Niger Delta. No? 
    Well, he is a danger to Nigeria, at the moment!
We all hailed you as being a pragmatic statesman when you coaxed 
    MEND’s Henry Okah to meet privately with you; after which meeting, 
    your media adviser, Segun Adeniyi, informed the world of your 
    preparedness to negotiate with ALL parties that could help 
    fast-track the process of peace in the Niger Delta.
We were even virtually ready to nominate you for next year’s 
    Nobel Peace Prize when MEND announced an indefinite ceasefire, 
    premised on what MEND termed your private reassurances to Okah that 
    you would meet with the group of distinguished Nigerians (the Aaron 
    Team led by Admiral Mike Okhai Akhigbe, one-time Nigeria’s number 
    two “man at the top”) MEND had asked you to speak with.
Even the Professor Pat Utomi-led coalition of Niger Delta ethnic 
    nationalities, UNDEDSS (the United Niger Delta Energy, Development 
    & Security Strategy) publicly applauded you for proactively 
    thinking out-of-the-box in the interest of the common good.
Consider, therefore, the shock this nation had of hearing “ 
    wanna-be-President”, General Abbe, 
    blustering on national and global television that “the Federal 
    Government will not talk with the Aaron Team”; and going on to 
    state categorically that “the Aaron Team is not relevant…!” If 
    anybody were trying to throw a spanner in the works of your 
    massively succeeding peace efforts, they could not have used more 
    inflammatory language. Which statement has since sent shockwaves 
    down many foreign diplomatic spines, by the way….
This is not to say that we are unaware of the divisions in the 
    camps of the militias (born-again or not) that may have led to the 
    conflicting statements regarding the existence of MEND or relevance 
    of the Aaron Team from the men-of-the-creeks. That may be as it 
    may.
But you are our national leader, with a better idea of what the 
    wrong perceptions of insecurity can cost Nigeria. Which is why you 
    are doing all that is possible to not only earn Nigerians a true 
    and sustainable peace nationwide, but also to ensure that there are 
    no perceptions to the contrary.
If that truly is your objective, sir (and we want to believe 
    that it is!), we advise you to heed the call by the Niger Delta 
    Elders and Leaders Forum, and call General Abbe to order 
    immediately and in no uncertain terms. This is a democracy, and 
    you, President Yar’Adua are our only President. Any inauspicious or 
    militaristic attempts at treating any of Nigeria’s peoples as 
    conquered POWs must be discouraged, before we inadvertently create 
    an environment that pushes us headlong, once again, into the 
    anarchy of military rule.
Please, stop Abbe, and his ilk, from masquerading as “the man at 
    the top”…unless we are to believe that you share ultimate executive 
    power with him. Shalom.

INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
Language is a powerful weapon with which an individual expresses 
    his or her ideas, emotions, feelings and thoughts. Language is a 
    vehicle for transmission of culture from one generation to another. 
    It is also a means of communication amongst people, in a society. 
    For any individual to be useful in his society he must acquire the 
    language of his people with some level of competency.
The English language serves as the medium of expression among 
    various ethnic groups in Nigeria. English is recognized as a second 
    language in Nigeria, that is, second after the mother tongue. It is 
    used as official language and medium of instruction in Nigerian 
    schools. In spite of this, the English language is learned by the 
    majority of Nigerian children as a second language through formal 
    classroom encounter.
One of the basic objectives of teaching English language in 
    Nigerian schools is to enable the students to communicate 
    proficiently either in speech or writing. In order to determine the 
    attainment of students in the use of English language as a medium 
    of effective communication in writing, various types of tests are 
    conducted in the school. Such tests cover a wide range of language 
    skills such as writing, speaking, reading etc.
Akere (1995) says that the poor quality of English that is 
    taught and used by students is a nagging problem because most 
    Nigerian secondary school students are not good users of English 
    language. Aliyu (1995) from his study found that students’ 
    proficiency in English language as measured by the West African 
    Examination council (WAEC) seems to be declining rapidly since the 
    failure rate between 1991 and 1995 has been in the region of 70 – 
    75 percent. Report of the WAEC Chief Examiner for examination 
    written in May/June, 2002 indicated that over 60 percent of 
    students’ failed English 
    language. This trend of mass failure has not changed as observed by 
    Oyinloye (2006). Ayodele (2001) laments the low competency level of 
    Nigerian students in English language. He observes that this has a 
    dismal effect on the overall achievement of students in other 
    courses.
Ubahakwe (1979) laments the poor quality of teaching methods 
    used by the language teachers and calls for an urgent revolution of 
    the teaching methods.
Ekpenyong (2002) showed that English language enables Nigerians 
    to communicate across multicultural, multiethnic and 
    multi-linguistic groups for social interaction and commercial 
    contacts. Other writers such as Eyoboh (2008), Eyoh (2004a), Eyoh 
    (2004b), Ifeanesia (1998), Umoh (1987) and Achebe (1975) have 
    enunciated the importance of the language in the unity of 
    heterogeneous groups in Nigeria. Eyoh (2007) explained that apart 
    from unifying the country, English language serves as a reliable 
    language in which governments in Nigeria transact their businesses. 
    The executive, the judiciary and the legislative arms of Nigerian 
    governments from the Federal, through States to Local Governments – 
    make use of English language in their daily businesses.
English language is also the language for wider communication, 
    the language of commerce, general business transactions as well as 
    the language of education. It is with this language that Nigeria 
    expresses her diplomacy and cultural identity in the international 
    market; Nigeria politics, trade and broadcasting are all done to a 
    large extent via English language.
In the Nigeria educational system, not only is English the 
    language of instructions for the large part of the educational 
    system, it is also one of the core subjects at all levels. 
    Inspite of the acknowledged 
    importance of this subject, Ekpo (1992) as well as Udofot (2000) 
    have shown that the performance of students in the subject has been 
    poor. Many students of Akwa Ibom State origin are denied admission 
    into Universities due to poor performance in English language. Some 
    of the students who were provided admission into remedial 
    programmes in Universities, quite a number of them have problems 
    with English language.
The higher percentage of failure in English language among 
    secondary school students in Nigeria demands that steps be taken to 
    improve their performances.
In most areas of human endeavour where people wish productivity 
    to improve one useful strategy that has yielded results is the use 
    of guidance and counselling.
Secondary school students come from various backgrounds, have 
    various learning abilities, and some experience problems in the 
    attempt to perform well. Due to the emphasis placed on English 
    language as a compulsory and important subject that students must 
    pass at credit level before they can be admitted into institutions 
    of higher learning or even offered employment in most lucrative 
    fields, quite a lot of students become over anxious and emotionally 
    disturbed when considering what to do in order to do well in the 
    subject. This problem becomes serious when the student has 
    experienced failure in the subject either once or repeatedly in the 
    past. Consequently, their performance in English language may be 
    poor. Students from deprived home backgrounds and neighbourhoods 
    have been shown by Ene and Nkang (2001) to experience some problems 
    in school. This may occur where the home is of low income group, 
    learning facilities for English language may not be readily 
    available and these children may learn English only in the school. 
    This may make them perform below average and develop a self concept 
    that may not do well in the subject.
If this situation is allowed to continue, such affected students 
    may end up not doing well in school and eventually drop out. This 
    situation would have a lot of negative implications for the nation. 
    Guidance and counselling are provided in schools so as to help 
    students who experience problems to realize themselves and take 
    rational decisions that would lead to an improvement of their 
    situations.
Milner quoted in Udokang (2007) defines guidance and counselling 
    in education to embody the presentation of knowledge, the 
    information and or advice to individuals or groups in a structured 
    way so as provide sufficient material upon which they may base 
    their choices or decisions.
Guidance is therefore a process of helping an individual to 
    understand himself and the reason for acting as he does under 
    different situations, hence enabling him to make his decision based 
    on his potentials.
Sanders (2000) defines counselling as an activity freely entered 
    into by the person seeking help. Counselling activity itself is 
    designed to help in self exploration and understanding. It is a 
    person-to-person relationship in which one person helps the other 
    person to resolve an area of conflict that has not been hitherto 
    resolved (Thompson & Poppen, 1972).
One of the areas of counselling used to help people that have 
    experienced some problems to recover and make a meaningful living 
    is rehabilitation counselling. According to Lawrence (2005) 
    rehabilitation is a treatment or treatments designed to facilitate 
    the process of recovery from injury, illness or disease to a normal 
    condition as possible. The purpose is to restore some or all of the 
    individuals’ physical, sensory and mental capabilities that were 
    lost due to injury, illness or disease. Rehabilitation counsellors 
    are involved with assisting individuals who have disabilities to 
    maximize their potentials and their independence.
As explained by Kemjika (1996), the concept of reinforcement is 
    central in operant conditioning theory of B.F. 
    Skinner. A consequence that produces repetition (increase in 
    frequency) of behaviour is called reinforcement or reward. 
    Reinforcement thus refers in general, to any process by which some 
    response tendency is strengthened by presentation of a reinforcer. 
    Some psychologists prefer using that term reinforcement to 
    reward.
Kemjika (1996) explains that there is a distinction between 
    reinforcement and reinforcer. A reinforcer is anything, be it a 
    stimulus or material object that strengthens or increases the 
    frequency of behaviour. This means that it increases the 
    probability that a desired response will be repeated.
A partial consequence cannot be considered to be a reinforcer 
    until its effect on behaviour is determined. Reinforcement, on the 
    other hand is the effect of a reinforcer on a person or the 
    procedure for presenting the reinforcer.
Chauhan (1987) is of the view that any environmental event that 
    is programmed as a consequence of a response that can increase the 
    rate of responding is called reinforcement.
Reinforcement is a procedure for controlling behaviour, not a 
    hypothetical device that produces stimulus – response 
    connection.
Enang (2006) explains that reinforcement is any stimulus or 
    variable manipulated to increase the probability that a specific 
    desirable behaviour will occur at all or again or an undesirable 
    behaviour will be dropped.
Reinforcement can be continuous, partial or intermittent. It can 
    also be present through various schedules such as the fixed ratio 
    schedules, variable ratio schedules, fixed internal schedule, or 
    variable internal schedule. Generally, reinforcement produces 
    excitement not only in those who receive it but also in those who 
    witness the event. The excitement in those who witness others being 
    reinforced is known as vicarious reinforcement.
Reinforcement and rehabilitation counselling have been known to 
    be effective to enhance performance in several situations. It is 
    important to find out whether the two variables can contribute 
    towards an improvement in students performance in English language 
    in secondary schools in Uyo Local Government Area.
1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:
The problem that attracts the attention of this researcher is 
    the high rate of failure of secondary schools students in English 
    language. Both in oral and written English, the performance of 
    students appear to be below average. This is manifested in the 
    large number of secondary school leavers that are denied admission 
    into Universities due to the low level of pass in English language 
    at the secondary school level. This problem not only denies the 
    students admission but also shuts the door of employment 
    opportunities against some especially those who seek employment in 
    top flight jobs in which high level of performance in English 
    language is required.
Furthermore, there are students who repeat classes due to poor 
    performance in the subject and have shown a tendency to develop a 
    culture of failure. These students have caused parents and 
    educators concern as to what should be done to help them out. 
    Reinforcement and rehabilitation counselling have been used to 
    improve performance of people in various fields of endeavour such 
    as in industry. The problem this study is to find out whether these 
    two factors can have a significant influence on students 
    performance in English language.
1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:
This study was carried out to investigate the effect of 
    reinforcement, rehabilitation counselling on students’ performance 
    in English language. Specifically, the study was designed to 
    achieve the following objectives:
i) To compare the performance of English language students who 
    received instructions with and without reinforcement.
ii) To compare the students’ performance in English language who 
    received instructions with and without rehabilitation 
    counselling.
iii) To ascertain the effect of reinforcement on the performance 
    of English language – male and female students.
iv) To examine the effect of rehabilitation counselling on male 
    and female students’ performance in English language.
v) To determine the joint effect of reinforcement and 
    rehabilitation counselling on students performance in English 
    language.
1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
i) How do student who receive reinforcement differ in their 
    English language performance from those who do not receive 
    reinforcement?
ii) How do students who receive rehabilitation counselling 
    differ in their English language performance from those who do 
    not?
iii) How does the English language performance of students given 
    material reward differ from those not given?
iv) How does non material reinforcement influence the English 
    language performance of students?
v) How do male students who receive reinforcement differ in 
    their English language performance from females who receive the 
    same reinforcement?
1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES:
The following null hypotheses were stated to guide this 
    researcher in the study.
i) There is no significant difference between the English 
    language performance of students who received instructions with 
    reinforcement and those received without the reinforcement.
ii) There is no significant difference between the English 
    language performance of students who received instructions with 
    rehabilitation counselling and those who had no such 
    counselling.
iii) There is no significant difference in the performance of 
    SS2 students in English language when treated with material reward 
    and without.
iv) There is no significant difference in the performance of SS2 
    students in English language when treated with non-material rewards 
    and without.
v) There is no significant difference between male and female 
    students performance in English language when reinforcement is 
    used.

NigerianEnglish,may,Geological Survey had also said that Nigeria’s discovered and undiscovered gas reserves may be 600 trillion standard cubic feet (tscf),epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,PNsc_09,"‘Arctic region holds third of world’s undiscovered gas 
    reserves’
The Arctic region may be storing 30 percent of the world’s 
    undiscovered natural gas reserves and most of them are in Russian 
    territory, an international team lead by the U.S. 
    Geological Survey (USGS) said last week.
This is the first-ever comprehensive assessment of undiscovered 
    oil and gas reserves within the Arctic Circle. Report about the 
    findings will appear in Friday’s edition of the journal Science.
According to the report, two-thirds of the undiscovered gas is 
    in just four areas - South Kara Sea, North Barents Basin, South 
    Barents Basin and the Alaska Platform. In fact, the South Kara Sea 
    off Siberia contains 39 per cent of the Arctic’s undiscovered 
    gas.
The report also estimated that the Arctic also contains three 
    percent to four per cent of the 
    world’s oil resources remaining to be discovered.
""It would not mean that there would be any kind of a 
    significant shift in global oil balance,"" said Donald 
    L. Gautier, lead author of the report. ""But this is 
    especially significant for the Arctic nations.""
Nations whose borders lie within the Arctic Circle are Canada, 
    Greenland/Denmark, Norway, Russia and the United States. Although 
    it’s closer to North America, Greenland is considered part of the 
    Kingdom of Denmark.
Using geological analysis and probability modeling, researchers 
    mapped out sedimentary rock deposits to estimate the amount of 
    undiscovered oil and gas beneath undersea continental shelves.
Researchers say that deep ocean basins have relatively low 
    petroleum potential, but the Arctic is one of the world’s largest 
    remaining areas where oil and gas are accessible. Most of the 
    reserves are projected to be in less than 500 metres of water - 
    roughly a third of a mile deep.
""Based on our study, there are 40 billion to 160 
    billion barrels of oil north of the Arctic Circle,"" 
    said Gautier, of the Geological Survey’s office in Menlo Park, 
    California. The USGS had previously estimated the Arctic is home to 
    90 billion barrels of oil.
The Energy Information Administration, a division of the 
    Department of Energy, estimates that the world currently uses 30 
    billion barrels of oil a year.
U.S. Geological Survey had also said that 
    Nigeria’s discovered and undiscovered gas reserves may be 600 
    trillion standard cubic feet (tscf). Currently, Nigeria’s gas 
    reserves is estimated at 187 tscf.

As you can see, it's good to

    as i yab you small now , you don begin 
    talk. Well, I have really been bothered about your 
    job matter and longed to hear from you. It was only when I got no 
    response that I decided to pull your legs. Keep your trust in His 
    power to give us ALL things that pertain to life and to godliness. 
    Encourage  for He lives, and if that 
    power that brought Christ from the dead touches her mortal body, it 
    will be made completely whole. This is the line in which the prayer 
    of faith will save the sick.

Thank you very much for all the mails, the concern, the efforts 
    to see me out of the woods. I am pursuing to escape the woods, that 
    prayers should turn to praise. I am working on the contacts for 
    opportunities. If the Lord helps me out then it is done. Quite a 
    good number are around Norway and the Netherlands. Those of Finland 
    require economics and business. i hope 
    to throw in as much as I can.
Meanwhile, we are still in the struggle for a residence permit; 
    it has cost me all kinds of money, energy and time. At a point I 
    began wondering whether it was worth it. I am not just happy. 
    Well... but I know God is in charge and would act in my favour but 
    I want it now or understanding of His position and feeling that may 
    calm my acheing nerves. Still 
    pray.

I arrived Poland on the 17th and have since been moving from one

    my papers for the study regularised. All appear friendly and the 
    environment promises so much. I however have a battle finding a 
    bible believing church. It's not common. what they have are 
    the marian churchians of the 
    order of Rome. Meanwhile, i understand 
    a few Baptists are here. I'm looking for them. Some 
    Nigerian's are around who are about to start one apparently of 
    the penterascal order, which my soul does abhor. I want real gospel 
    work here. Pray on for me.
Your wife should be through by now; so there should be something 
    to wash. I wait for my invitation and ticket to come over for a 
    good dance. You know I need enough time to learn a good dance, 
    since I have not been dancing for so many decades now. Tell 
    bro  that 
    we shall meet on that day. Please invite him also.

Ndeewo!
The visa is now ready. Their pranks could not be sustained 
    because God would want me in Poland. However, it is 5 months that 
    they gave. My plan is to get there first. I believe the required 
    adjustments will follow.  seems to 
    have bothered them before they released it. All the same, we give 
    God thanks for everything. I will let you know the departure 
    schedule in my next mail.
Remaining ever grateful for your efforts, care and concern.
Greet your house.

Oh yes, dear Madam, as I was saying before I was rudely 
    interrupted by Night and her brother, Sleep, the other issues may 
    now follow.
Concerning the guide provided, I only need to add that you also 
    get prof 
    's phone 
    no, from her website ( just google her name,);' 
    Tram' may be unfamiliar to people 
    like us: it is a mini train, running on rails but working like 
    buses with designated'stops' and picking 
    and dropping passengers within cities. Numbers are also indicated 
    on their bodies and/or names. In this the case of 
    uni , 
    for instance, the tram that goes there is 
    Tram 3 ( from 
    ). if i 
    know when you might be arriving, I'll look out for you ( only 
    pray I won't be a blind guide).
With respect to data, anything goes: secondary school/ 
    university scripts written in English, term papers, lectures 
    recorded in audio or video materials, public speech, discussions, 
    special occasions, family and bedroom gist, meetings, etc 
    
My ticket and others have also reached me 
    to day. I plan to arrive on the 
    17th and depart on 23rd; so by evening of 17th I would have been 
    there already, God willing.
We keep praying. We'll still talk.
Kindest regards,

Thank you dear, for all my sins graciously forgiven. I have been 
    pressed for some time; so only manage to respond to things that may 
    not wait. The other is that because I love God I fear to sin, and 
    fear most to sin against you. This time, I had to find the time 
    because there was a threat to withdraw the promise of giving me a 
    phd, even though it is about 2am now.
I see your situation regarding the workshop. I guess the actions 
    with embassy did not commence on time. However, you are on track by 
    keeping the pressure on prof 
     and her team; I believe 
    they'll do everything possible within their law to see it gets 
    through. On our own part, let's keep praying; and you prepare 
    to travel at the slightest notice if running out of time. For this 
    kind of programme and opportunity, it's better late than 
    never.
I'll still write and discuss the other issues; but 
    it's too late now to continue.
May God give us this miracle!
 
    
Thank you very much Madam, especially for your willingness to 
    now award me this phd that has been outstanding. My worry though is 
    that it will now be in a field I'm not trained, and in 
    mischief - cracking peoples ribs. Moreover, I fear that might make 
    me a highly qualified quack. What if i 
    suggest it should be in the field of babysitting and home chores, 
    or on onomastics? areas where I'm already 
    distinquished. But if my 
    suggestion is not acceptable, then give me the one you proposed; 
    I'll manage it. After all 
    phd na 
    phd.
Concerning your preparations, press on the organisers to send a 
    copy of your invitation to the German embassy in Nigeria. This 
    might facilitate the approval. Also see how you can make them keep 
    in touch with their embassy, and only feed you back. In this way, 
    they may be the ones to inform you about developments, including 
    informing you when the approval is given; so that you merely go to 
    pick up the visa. I pray for you and believe you'll be 
    through.
How was 's headship? 
    I'm surprised that dr  was not 
    given time to settle down after his return. Well... who 
    knows....the considerations...
I should prepare to go to bed.
Take care,

Dear madam,
Thank you for your mail. I read it in a hurry, thinking I'd 
    get back to it and then reply, but pressures carried me away. 
    Please add also this my sin to the ones you have forgiven.
Concerning the query on the'English' 
    of my mail, I guess it is one of the edoid languages; so, I think 
    you're in a better position to tell. I was taught it on my 
    arrival and stay in Edo. It is completely unknown in the Igbo 
    nation, the best I know, but for Port Harcourt.
Concerning your work, now that your supervisor has traveled out, 
    you'll also travel out; so that it'll be one - one, no 
    victor no vanquish, period! When we meet, remind me to congratulate 
    you for being gracefully patient and resilient; but if the work is 
    through before we meet, then the 
    congrats could be part of my dance, celebrating an all round 
    excellent you.
Well, how far is your preparation? Have you got the visa yet, 
    and the flight ticket and others? How is your family getting set to 
    miss you a little? I would have come to take care of your children 
    in your absence, except that I'll also be in 
    . You know, that also is my 
    profession. But if you can get some 
    one like me, that'll be ok. Incidentally, most of my 
    colleagues in that profession who I may recommend are found around 
    the  environs, far from where you 
    are.
I guess we'd have a new H.O.D now, or is 
     continuing? Tell more...when you 
    reply.
God bless your soul and keep you prospering!

Madam, you do well. 
    God go bless you too much!
How you de prepare 
    for Germany? You don wash your clothes finish, iron them, buy box, 
    make hair, etc? School fees no dey sha, but you fit collect pocket 
    money, wee you go take buy sweet, chingum, chin chin, and snap 
    foto.
Any new show 
    for  
    side? I expect say de 
    thing go thro before August, so that we go wash am for Augsburg. 
    That mean say you go fine better he-goat wee you go bring come. 
    Then, you go quick come, so that you go teach me better Esan song 
    wee I go dance for you, as I go de chop the he-goat. No think say 
    better thing no good for my body-o: make de he-goat strong well 
    well, make him bear-bear de reach ground, make people know say na 
    better thing we de wash.
Madam, I salute you,

NigerianEnglish,may,A simple and well structured problem (task) may hinder designer’s full understanding of the problem and hence lead to inappropriate and incomplete solution,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,ATec_09,"THEORETICAL APPROACHES IN SOFTWARE COMPLEXITY 
    METRICS
INTRODUCTION
In software engineering, attempt is usually made to design and 
    develop workable computer-based solutions for problem solving 
    tasks. The workability and reliability of the emerging computer 
    based systems (or solutions) depend on the associated software. The 
    understanding of the original problems (or tasks) by software 
    engineer will influence the workability and reliability of the 
    software design for the problems. The software engineer’s 
    understanding of the original problems depend on how the problems 
    are structured. A simple and well structured problem (task) may 
    hinder designer’s full understanding of the problem and hence lead 
    to inappropriate and incomplete solution. Faults in software do 
    arise from design phase (i.e. design errors), 
    improper modification or transient hardware errors which corrupt 
    the stored program. Errors in software design most often arise from 
    the complexity of problem. Thus, it has been asserted that 25% 
    increase in problem complexity would lead to 100% increase in 
    emerging program or software complexity (Woodfield, 1989).
Markusz and Kaposi (1985) noted the growing awareness of the 
    high risk and excessive cost associated with poor-quality complex 
    software design. Maintenance of large scale complex software 
    systems is a very expensive, time consuming and error prone 
    activity. Hence, research into software complexity measurement, as 
    a means of understanding how to control the degree of complexity of 
    software design and development, has emerged.
In this paper, attempt is made to examine the theoretical issues 
    involved in software complexity metrics. To this end, we shall be 
    examining the following in the subsequent sections:
i. Meaning of and need for software complexity metrics.
ii. Forms of software complexity
iii. Methods of dealing with problems of software complexity
iv. Review of existing methods of measuring software 
    complexity
v. Summary and conclusion
1.2 MEANING OF AND NEED FOR SOFTWARE
COMPLEXITY METRICS
By software complexity metrics we refer to measures of the 
    error-prone of the software development process, the ease of 
    debugging and modification (Potier et al. 
    (1982); Rault (1979); Schneidewind and Hoffmann (1979) 
    ). The need for the fact that in 
    seeking solution to a problem, there are many factors that designer 
    needs to consider, namely; performance, reliability, availability, 
    adaptability, maintainability and complexity. Of all these factors, 
    complexity impinges on many of these other factors especially 
    maintainability and dependability. The aim of software complexity 
    metrics therefore is to seek for ways of reducing faults in 
    software design and development and promotes the efficiency, 
    reliability and maintainability of software. To this end it has 
    been observed that there is much more to good software design than 
    knowledge of programming language. Structured programming and the 
    various software design methodologies therefore seek to control 
    software quality by imposing a discipline on the designer which 
    controls the complexity of design tasks and supplements the rules 
    of the programming language. (Markusz et al, 
    Op.cit.).
1.3 FORMS OF SOFTWARE COMPLEXITY
Curtis et al (1979) proposed two types of 
    software complexity: computational and psychological.
By computational complexity we refer to the quantitative aspects 
    of the algorithm which solves a given problem, estimating the speed 
    of the execution of a program. Psychological complexity on the 
    other hand measures the difficulty of the processes of design, 
    comprehensive maintenance and modification of the program 
    itself.
Furthermore two levels of software complexity have also been 
    identified, viz; internal and external 
    complexity. Internal complexity of software looks at the kind of 
    interaction within each module of the software while the external 
    complexity of a software is the amount of interaction a module has 
    with its environment which is defined by other modules. Thus the 
    overall complexity of a system is made up of both the internal 
    complexity of each module and the external complexity due to module 
    interrelationships (See Lew, et al, 988).
Ramamoorthy et al, (1985) also identified two 
    levels of complexity of software, namely; the sequential complexity 
    and complexity due to concurrency. The authors went further to say 
    that for distributed program, which realises concurrency by 
    parallel execution of separate task communication, the program 
    complexity consists of two components, namely 
    ; local complexity and communication complexity. By local 
    complexity we refer to the complexity of the individual tasks, 
    disregarding their interactions with other tasks. The communication 
    complexity on the other hand reflects the complexity of the 
    interaction among the tasks. The two levels of complexity 
    identified by Ramamoorthy et al (1985) are akin 
    to the two forms of complexity identified by (Lew, et 
    al., 1988).
1.4 METHODS OF DEALING WITH PROBLEMS OF SOFTWARE 
    COMPLEXITY
There are problems associated with developing reliable software 
    for large systems. In dealing with problems of complexity of 
    software design, two methods are usually considered, namely 
    ;
a) the divide and conquer technique (DCT), and
b) software fault tolerant technique (SFTT).
In divide and conquer technique, attempt is made to decompose 
    the original problem into sub-programs with well defined 
    interactions, leading to a structured design. The aim is to control 
    the degree of complexity the designer has to deal with. The use of 
    software fault tolerant techniques requires addition of software 
    redundancy such as n-version programme and recovery blocks. 
    However, it has been observed that the use of any software fault 
    tolerant technique (SFTT) could cause a conflict between software 
    reliability and complexity, and possibly reduces software 
    reliability.
1.5 REVIEW OF EXISTING SOFTWARE COMPLEXITY 
    METRICS
The earliest attempts at measuring software complexity date back 
    to the work of Dijkstra (1968). Dijkstra (op.cit) observed 
    that the quality of program is a decreasing function of the density 
    of go to statements found in it. Hence, a very 
    simple measure of software complexity is the number of go 
    tos in a program. This was observed as an inappropriate 
    measure of unstructuredness for some languages like FORTRAN, but 
    can be used for ALGOL type of language. However, it has been noted 
    that go tos are essential ingredient for 
    writing structured FORTRAN (Neely, 1976).
Gilb (1977) observed that logical complexity is a measure of the 
    degree of decision making within a system and that the number of 
    If statements is a rough measure of this 
    complexity. Farr and Zagorski (1965) found this metric to be a 
    significant factor in predicting software cost. It were opined that 
    it is reasonable generally to count not only the ifs but all the 
    branch creating statements (decision points) in a program.
McCabe (1976) adopted a different approach to software 
    complexity measure. He developed a theory based on the modelling of 
    programs as directed graphs. The complexity of the program was then 
    said to be measurable by the cyclomatic complexity of the digraph. 
    The original formulation of McCabe’s theories was said to lack 
    rigour.
In 1979, Woodward et al, examined two 
    measures of complexity, namely; the Knot count and McCabe’s 
    cyclomatic number. A knot is defined by drawing an arrowed line on 
    one side of the program text, indicating where a jump occurs from 
    one line of text, to another line of the program text. This was 
    demonstrated using a FORTRAN program. A knot is stated 
    mathematically as follows: If a jump from line a to line b is 
    represented by the ordered pair of integers (a,b), then jump (p,q) 
    gives rise to “knot” or crossing point with respect to jump (a,b) 
    if ;

By counting the number of “knots” in a program a measure of 
    complexity can be obtained. It has been observed that the use of 
    knot count as a measure of complexity is simpler in FORTRAN 
    programs because FORTRAN language is a language with one statement 
    per line. For the programming languages which permit many 
    statements per line, the number of knots becomes ill-defined, 
    except the programs are reformatted.
An incidence matrix corresponding to the directed graph was also 
    proposed as a measure of knots in a program from the lower and 
    upper bounds. Thus for a directed graph with (i,j) edge, where 
    i>j or i<j and p= min (i,j) and q = max (i,j), the lower 
    bound can be obtained by counting the number of entries to nodes 
    strictly between p and q to nodes strictly outside the range p to 
    q, and also the number of exits from nodes strictly between p and q 
    to nodes strictly outside the range p to q. The upper bound can be 
    obtained by adding into the count number of nonzero elements if 
    i<j and if i>j. The number of knots in a program is dependent 
    on the ordering of the statements in a program. The authors came up 
    with knot count of

to simulate an n-way case using the computed GO TO.
The authors also found an interesting link between knot count 
    and cyclomatic complexity measure V(G) of McCabe (1976). Using a 
    directed graph concept, a program is first represented in directed 
    graph and then the McCabe’s cyclomatic complexity is estimated as 
    follows:
.
This was shown to be equal to the number of predicates (i.e. decision points) in the program plus one. Using a 
    sample of 26 FORTRAN subroutines from a numerical algorithms 
    library, the author concluded that the knot count provides a much 
    clearer indication of program readability while the cyclomatic 
    complexity V(G) is usually greater then the number of knots.
Kaposi et al, (1979) measured the complexity 
    of PROLOG programs. PROLOG is a language based on first order 
    predicate logic, in which the specification of the problem and the 
    means of realising the solution can be expressed. The rules of the 
    PROLOG language demand the explicit statement of the problem on 
    hand, and the composition of the solution as a strict hierarchical 
    structure of related and explicitly specified parts called 
    partition. Each partition could be considered as an autonomous 
    entity, hence the complexity of the designer’s task could be 
    related to the local complexity of partitions rather than to the 
    global complexity of the PROLOG programs as whole.
The complexity of a partition appears to depend on the data 
    relating it to its environment, the number of subtasks within it, 
    the relationships among subtasks, and the data flow through the 
    structure. Local complexity was then expressed as a function of 
    these four arguments as parameters. The complexity function was 
    considered as the unweighed sum of the complexity parameters as 
    follows
.
The partitions were sorted into four complexity bands according 
    to the value of their complexity function as follows:

Later development showed a deficiency of the complexity function 
    of the equation formulated by Kaposi et al 
    (op. cit) in capturing all of the aspects of task 
    complexity. Thus, Markusz and Kaposi (1985) proposed the 
    introduction of new parameters into the complexity function of the 
    earlier equation. The proposed complexity function then became 
    .

From their experiment they found out the new measure represent a 
    considerable improvement in quantifying the difficulty of design 
    tasks. They concluded by saying that the complexity measures 
    proposed could be applied in two ways;
i) to prevent errors, controlling the quality of newly designed 
    software as a means of quality assurance, to detect the areas of 
    potential design weakness in existing software; and
ii) to guide the process of reconstruction into functionally 
    equivalent but complexity controlled firm.
Shatz (1988) proposed complexity measure for distributed 
    software using Ada as a programming language for implementation. 
    Reviewing the previous work of complexity metric on Ada (see Gannon 
    et al, 1986, Bombach and Basili, 1987); the 
    author observed that none of the existing research then has 
    explicitly considered the concurrency features of Ada languages. 
    Shatz (op.cit) opined that for distributed program, which 
    realises concurrency by parallel execution of separate tasks and 
    which constrain the concurrency by introducing task communication, 
    the program complexity consists of two components, local complexity 
    (LC) which reflects the complexity of the individual tasks, 
    disregarding their interactions with other tasks; and communication 
    complexity (CC) which reflects the complexity of the interactions 
    among the tasks. Hence, a distributed program’s complexity (TC) was 
    then formulated as:
.
The communication complexity metric was based on counting the 
    number of communication statements in the program. For Ada program, 
    this implies counting the number of Entry call statements and 
    Accept statements. Hence, this metric was found to correspond to 
    McCabe’s cyclomatic metric which counts decision points. For local 
    complexity the knot, count metric, which examines the relations 
    between the decision points, was introduced. Lew et 
    al, (1988) realised the existence of many internal 
    complexity measures which have proved useful in software design. 
    The author then aim at developing an external complexity measure. 
    An external complexity metric of a program measures the amount of 
    interaction between a module and its environment. This is expressed 
    as

which is the sum of interaction between module i and the other 
    modules j, i + j;
where; Ci = external complexity of a 
    module i
TICij = total information content of the 
    message from i to j, and
TICji = total information content of the 
    message from j to i.
However, the overall complexity of a system is made up of both 
    the internal complexity of each module, and the external complexity 
    due to module interrelationship. Thus, the complexity of a module 
    (Mi) in a system is the weighted sum of the 
    internal and external complexities, Ki and 
    Ci
respectively, i.e.
.
In attempt to evaluate software complexity measures, Weyuker 
    (1988) outlined a set of nine desirable syntax properties. Four of 
    the complexity measures were subject to evaluation based on the 
    properties. The tested complexity measures include the number of 
    program statements, McCabe’s cyclomatic number, Halstead’s 
    programming effort and knot measure. The last metric was ignored on 
    the ground that the knot measure of any structured program is zero, 
    as use was made of structured programming language for 
    implementation. The statement count as a measure of program 
    complexity is the number of program statements. This was considered 
    very simple way of computing program complexity. The McCabe’s 
    cyclomatic number defines the complexity of a program as
.
Halstead’s programming effort in defining the program complexity 
    first of all defined the following terms:

NigerianEnglish,may,They may be but not necessarily professionals or graduates but they surround themselves with competent people,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,SkHo_25,"Your path to success and wealth
By now, I am sure that we are all conscious of our financial 
    health and no longer wrongfully assume that the future will take 
    care of itself (faith without works???)
In the last edition, we focused on two major points:
(a) The need to identify your heart‘s desire, that is knowing 
    exactly what you really want, and;
(b) The need to personalize that desire to suit your 
    circumstance.
Having settled that, the next step will be to determine exactly 
    where you are-Your true financial 
    situation, not what you think you have or what you hope to have. 
    So, I suggest you start by asking yourself the following 
    questions:
-What are your income, lifestyle and equity goals?
-Is there any way you can streamline your spending to fit into 
    your budget?
-Where did your money go, and how can you increase your 
    wealth?
-Are there strategies for generating new sources of wealth?
-How do you quit your unnecessary spending habits that 
    inevitably run you into debts?
-How do you develop the habit of saving in order to achieve 
    financial freedom?
TIME TO TAKE STOCK
Now, write down the following: your present earning, how much 
    money you have in the bank (if any), your debt profile, your net 
    worth and more particularly, your expenses on daily, weekly or 
    monthly basis. If you are not happy with the result of this 
    stock-taking, then, it is time to seriously consider how best to 
    move from your financial struggle to financial freedom.
SO, WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM?
I told you in the previous edition that there are a lot of ways 
    to get rich, which include: chance, speculation, inheritance, 
    theft, extortion, contract scams, counterfeiting, 419, kidnapping, 
    etc.But I also said that 
    MoneySense is only 
    interested in ONE WAY:
The Legitimate Way
Now that you know where you are (your financial situation) and 
    are ready to move forward, it is important that you also understand 
    who you are. By this, I mean your inner self. What is your passion? 
    Follow your passion and start to determine in which direction your 
    energies can be better utilized for effective results.There are 
    generally four categories of people. The category you fall into is 
    usually determined by who you are inside you, your strengths, your 
    fears, your likes and dislikes. This explains why one man‘s meat is 
    another man‘s poison.
For example, are you an employee? This category of people prefer 
    a good steady job where the salaries are guaranteed every month 
    with good benefits to back it up. They are mainly individuals who 
    are security-oriented, and they are happy in employments once there 
    exists binding agreements on their employers. They could be CEOs, 
    Secretaries, or even Security men in any organization, but 
    insecurity and uncertainty are their worst enemies. So, if you are 
    one of those who hate the feeling of fear that comes with economic 
    uncertainty and you are unwilling to take the risk of 
    self-employment, then employment with a secure organization with 
    good benefits will be the best for you.
Others prefer to be Self-employed. These are usually 
    professionals who desire nothing other than to be their own boss. 
    They hate having their income being dictated by others. If they 
    work hard, they expect to be paid well for it and they are not in 
    any way disturbed if they receive nothing for work left undone. The 
    Self-Employed type expects his pay to be commensurate with the 
    quality of his work. They are true artists with their own style of 
    doing things, and usually believe that no one can do a better 
    job.
For this group of people, their independence, freedom and the 
    desire to gain respect as experts in their field is much more 
    important to them. They find it difficult to employ people like 
    themselves because they have the notion that no one can be as good 
    as them. And this means that they have to work much harder because 
    most things are done by them. This group responds to their fears, 
    not by seeking security, but by taking control of their destiny.
Or are you a Business Owner? These are risk bearers, individuals 
    with good leadership qualities and great drive with the ability to 
    set up a good system that works. They may be but not necessarily 
    professionals or graduates but they surround themselves with 
    competent people. The business owner‘s skills are not usually 
    taught in schools and that is why some of the wealthiest people on 
    earth have quit school to become very successful businessmen. They 
    love to delegate duties and are willing to pay for services 
    rendered. The personnel they hire could come from any or all the 
    categories. They are not afraid to bear the risk of investing in 
    their own business.
Then there are The Investors: This is the rich man‘s playground 
    where money works to make money. They are not the typical 9-5 men 
    or the very ‘hard working’ type. They 
    are already done with that. What distinguishes them from the others 
    is their readiness to take investment risks that some others would 
    never contemplate. If you hope to be rich one day, no matter which 
    of the above categories you make your money from, you will 
    ultimately need to get here. This is the place of extreme financial 
    freedom. The place I would love to be!

We Nigerians are a different set of people. We just love 
    flamboyance. It is amazing. Every one wants to look good. We all 
    know it is alright to look good. Everyone wants to live and look 
    like a Hollywood star.
There is no problem with that. But the question is, does 
    everyone earn what a Hollywood star earns? Really when a person has 
    to borrow money to look good, it becomes a problem. For us, looking 
    good starts with the house we live in, the car we drive, the clubs 
    we go to, the people we hang out with, the shoes we wear and the 
    whole works. Think about it.
If a person has to borrow to fulfill those obligations as the 
    case may be, then there is a problem. We are not talking about food 
    or clothing to cover ones body here. We are talking of extreme 
    vanity. Too many people are in debt and problems unnecessarily. We 
    really all have to sit back. Reflect and change our mind set.
Listen to me!!! You are here to fulfill your destiny. It is not 
    tied to any other persons destiny. You are not in competition with 
    any one. Your focus must be on living well. Believe me, living well 
    is possible. Living well is not supposed to be stressful if we all 
    learn to “cut our coat according to the cloth we have"" 
     What I am saying essentially is that you 
    live within your means.
We are all agreed that everyone can make a living. Come on now, 
    even an artisan in Nigeria earns at east two thousand naira 
    everyday , and labor is at least one thousand naira everyday. We 
    have already established the fact that every one can work. There is 
    something everyone can do to make money if you are not 
    condescending. The problem we have is that everyone wants to start 
    of big.
Your neighbor or friend is a ‘big boy’ or ‘big girl’ as the case may be, 
    and you want to kill yourself. You do not even know the price 
    he/she had to pay to get to where they are.
Many people really have enough to do what they need to do, but 
    they think they must do it bigger so they can show off for all to 
    see. Really!!! Who cares !
We all need to change our mindset. We all must realize that in 
    this world, you are not in competition with anyone. It is so sad. 
    Many people want to wear Ferragamo shoes, Rolex or Cartier watches, 
    drive the latest BMW, live in Park view estate and Ikoyi. There is 
    nothing wrong with all these things if you can really afford 
    them.
You must use what you have to get what you really need. You need 
    shoes, buy shoes. You need a wrist watch, there are so many 
    functional wristwatches. If you can afford to pay your rent 
    anywhere every month for the rest of your life without having to 
    borrow any money from anyone, you are living good. You are on 
    top.
Too many people need to buy a car. They know they have enough 
    for a Pinto, but they must buy a Passat. What is wrong with us. 
    That you can buy a Pinto and maintain it, is a lot of Grace. There

    the wife was telling her friend. “Finally, we found a place. But 
    it’s just a one bedroom apartment” Who 
    cares!!! The stress is all yours.
Everyone has their life to live. Live yours. With what you have, 
    you can live well. It is a mindset. It is all about contentment.
What I am saying is not that you should be complacent. There is 
    always a place for growth. You can only be where you are at any 
    point in time. If point A is where you are now, be realistic. Yes, 
    you are aspiring to get to point B, but what point A has to offer, 
    receive it and enjoy it with thanksgiving. When you do get to point 
    B, you can step up into what point B has it offer.
That point A that you are at now, and you do not appreciate is 
    someone else’s aspiration. Be happy. Be content.
I visited this African country last weekend, and I think they

    better turn for their country, they went back and they are enjoying 
    it.
Now you see most of them with small functional cars that can 
    take them from point A to B. Many live in small houses. I am not 
    saying that they don’t have their own minuses, but they are happy 
    people. I see them as people making the best of what they have.
They have discovered oil now, I know when oil money comes, they

NigerianEnglish,may,"One of those things that cause early brushing is when most individuals wake up in the morning, the mouth will not be fresh, and the individual may not feel so good",epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,PNsc_17,"Gum disease may increase cancer risk
Gum disease may increase the risk of developing cancer, 
    researchers have said. Male health professionals with a history of 
    gum disease in a long-running study, have a 14 per cent higher 
    overall risk of developing cancer, they said.
""After controlling smoking and other risk factors, 
    periodontal disease was significantly associated with an increased 
    risk of lung, kidney, pancreatic and hematological (blood) 
    cancers,"" Dr. Dominique Michaud of Imperial 
    College, London and colleagues wrote in the journal, 
    Lancet Oncology.
This higher overall risk persisted even in people who had never 
    smoked.
Gum or periodontal disease is an infection of the tissues 
    surrounding and supporting the teeth. Prior studies have suggested 
    people with periodontal disease are more likely to develop heart 
    disease and diabetes.
Dr. Kabir Muhammad, a dental surgeon at Dans Medical 
    Centre and Dental Clinic, Ikorodu Road, Ketu, Lagos, said that gum 
    diseases could be prevented through regular tooth brushing and 
    flossing.
He said people have gum diseases because they do not apply good 
    brushing technique and they hardly floss their teeth.
His words: ""Regular tooth brushing and flossing are the 
    preventive measures of oral diseases. A regular brushing and 
    flossing of teeth, will make the individual have very low oral 
    diseases.
""Regular tooth brushing means, brush your teeth twice 
    daily; preferably morning and night. It is more beneficial to brush 
    the teeth after food in the morning and make it the last thing at 
    night. We are not brushing to increase our appetite; rather 
    brushing is done to eliminate the food debris left in the mouth 
    after eating.
""So, when brushing is done after eating, it is more 
    beneficial to the mouth than before eating. Food debris hangs in 
    the mouth if brushing is done before eating. But if the brushing is 
    done after eating, all the food debris will be brushed off. This 
    will make the individual start the day without any food debris in 
    the mouth (clean and fresh).""
The surgeon continued: ""Accordingly, if the individual 
    wants to sleep at night, it is preferable to brush the mouth. This 
    will make all the food debris (or particles) that have been hanging 
    between the teeth during the day, brushed off, without following 
    the person to bed. So, the person is going to sleep feeling fresh. 
    The good news about this is, there will be no food debris for 
    bacteria to work on, overnights.
""There is nothing wrong in brushing before eating in the 
    morning, like its cultural in our environment. One of those things 
    that cause early brushing is when most individuals wake up in the 
    morning, the mouth will not be fresh, and the individual may not 
    feel so good. This is as a result of the fact that the mouth has 
    not been producing saliva all night.
""Though, it is very important to brush before or after food 
    in the morning, it is more important to brush at night.
""Dental floss is like a tiny little rope that is used to 
    clean in-between the teeth. It cleans where brushes cannot easily 
    get to.
""Instead of using tooth pick, it is advisable to use dental 
    floss. Dental floss is what is professionally recognised and 
    recommended. Tooth pick affects both the gum and teeth. It causes 
    damage to the gum and holes in the teeth, giving room for more 
    particles to stick in, thereby leading to a periodontal 
    disease.""
The implication of this is that, the more you use toothpick, the 
    more there are holes in your teeth, and this gives room for food 
    debris to comfortably reside in your teeth. With time, you will 
    start having problems with your teeth, gum, or even breadth.
""Regular tooth flossing will help a lot. To floss, the 
    edges of the tiny rope will be with both hands, and used between 
    each tooth. There are different sizes and shapes. Flossing is more 
    effective than toothpick. It’s friendlier to the gum, and more 
    effective for the teeth. All the places that the brush can not get 
    to, flossing can take care of it.
""Dental floss cannot be easily gotten because Nigerians do 
    not really buy it. So, it is only sold in the major supermarkets 
    and hospital pharmacies. The fact that tooth pick is cheap, makes 
    people buy and use it more than the floss, unknown to them, they 
    are destroying their teeth.
""It is important for individuals to know the technique of 
    brushing. The type of brush you use matters a lot. Some people use 
    very hard toothbrush, thinking that the harder the toothbrush the 
    cleaner the teeth will be. Not knowing that the hard tooth brush 
    causes problem for their teeth, because it will wear away the 
    surface of their teeth, the hard surface, and the enamel. The teeth 
    under the enamel will be exposed, so when anything touches the 
    teeth, it will shock them. Hard tooth brush also destroys the gum, 
    causing gingival recession.
""While brushing, you are not supposed to use force; rather, 
    you are supposed to use technique. You are supposed to brush from 
    your gum, down, if you are brushing the upper teeth, and from your 
    gum up, if you are brushing the lower teeth. That way, you will not 
    destroy your gum,"" Muhammad said.
The medical expert’s advice for Nigerians: ""Go for dental 
    check-up every six months, whether you have pain or not. If that is 
    done on a regular basis, you would not have a gum disease and your 
    mouth will be free from a lot of problems.""
But a lot of Nigerians don’t have that attitude. ""A typical 
    Nigerian doesn’t like to visit a dentist, even when he or she has 
    pain, he or she will still be managing the pain, until he or she 
    can’t sleep, that is when he or she will go to a dental clinic with 
    series of complaints.
""Ninety-five per cent of the cases we see are people coming 
    late. They wouldn’t come when the problem is mild. On enquiry about 
    when it started, they will say, ‘it’s been long o!. It’s been up to 
    two or three years’. They’ve been managing it by going to chemist 
    shops using different kinds of drugs, visiting herbal shops to get 
    all sorts of drug in order to treat the problem which could have 
    been avoided.""
""They would have tried all possible methods at home, 
    petrol, battery water, touch-and-go, grounded ‘Alabukun’, chewing 
    stick (pako ayan), it is when everything has 
    failed, that they will now show up at the clinic. By this time, 
    they would have inflicted all sorts of chemical burns,"" he 
    further said.
Really, to prevent gum diseases, ensure your mouth is brushed in 
    the right way, twice daily, using toothpaste with fluoride.
How the study was done
People with gum diseases have inflammation in their blood and 
    inflammation also has been linked with cancer. But this could 
    simply mean that whatever causes the inflammation may also cause 
    gum disease and cancer. Michaud and colleagues wanted to see if gum 
    disease increases the risk of cancer.
They used data from a large study of male doctors and other 
    health professionals aged 40 to 75. The study was started in 1986 
    at Havard University, U.S.
Nearly 50,000 men filled out health surveys and were followed 
    for more than 17 years. The survey included information on gum 
    disease and bone loss, as well as number of teeth and tooth 
    loss.
More than 5,700 of the men developed cancer, excluding cases of 
    non-melanoma skin cancers and non-aggressive prostate cancer. The 
    researchers found that men who had gum disease had 14 percent 
    higher cancer risk compared to those who did not.
The risks were higher depending on the type of cancer.
Periodontal diseases must be treated
Those with history of gum disease had a 36 per cent higher risk 
    of lung cancer, 49 per cent higher risk of kidney cancer, 54 per 
    cent highr risk of pancreatic 
    cancer and 30 per cent higher risk of having a blood cancer (such 
    as non-hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia or multiple myeloma) compared to 
    men who did not have a history of gum disease.
In those who never smoked, gum disease was linked with a 21 per 
    cent increase in overall cancer risk and a 35 per cent higher risk 
    of blood cancers. They found no association for lung cancer in this 
    group.
Men who had fewer teeth (0 to 16) at the start of the study had 
    a 70 per cent higher risk of lung cancer compared with individuals 
    with more teeth (25 to 32) at the start of the study but this may 
    be linked with smoking.
""The increased risks noted for haematological, 
    kidney, and pancreatic cancers need confirmation but suggest that 
    gum disease might be a marker of a susceptible immune system or 
    might directly affect cancer risk,"" Michaud said in a 
    statement.
It is worth noting that, it is not only the men that are prone 
    to the condition, women too are.
The researchers say it is premature to suggest that good oral 
    hygiene can prevent cancer but said periodontal disease should 
    nevertheless be treated.

Tomorrow’s by-election into the House of 
    Representatives in Ibeju-Lekki Constituency, Lagos State, has 
    provided a turf for fresh battle between progressive politicians 
    and their conservative rivals, reports Deputy Political Editor 
    EMMANUEL OLADESU
Inside the ring are Prince Jamiu Eletu, a businessman from 
    Awoyaya and Okanlawon Soniyi, a retired civil servant.
While Eletu is contesting on the platform of the oldest 
    progressive party in this dispensation, the Alliance for Democracy 
    (AD), Soniyi is challenging him as the flag bearer of the Peoples 
    Democratic Party (PDP).
Tomorrow, Ibeju-Lekki will be an interesting battle field. The 
    historical antecedent of the constituency and character of its 
    political leaders make it tick. It has been difficult to pin them 
    down to one party.
In 1998, during the local government election, the All Nigeria 
    Peoples Party (ANPP) installed the local government chairman, 
    Dr. Tola Kasali. The following year, another ANPP stalwart, 
    Tona Yusuf won the House of Representatives election.
In 2003, AD displaced ANPP. In fact, many members of ANPP 
    defected to AD. In 2007, AC Action Congress (AC) won the seat.
Also in 1999, ANPP produced the two members of House of 
    Assembly. In 2003, AD candidates displaced them.
In 2007, Musiliu Alogba and Taofeek Adedoyin, both PDP 
    candidates won the two legislative seats.
In 2007, AC candidate, Isiaq Olawale was elected into the House 
    of Representatives. But, he was judicially deposed following the 
    discovery of some irregularities in his Senior Secondary School 
    Examination (SSCE) certificate.
As the parties put finishing touches to their plans to clinch 
    victory, observers have predicted a titanic battle tomorrow in the 
    fishing community. While PDP is laying claim to overwhelming 
    popularity, AD is disputing it.
AC has no candidate for the poll. But, the party, led by Chief 
    Dele Ajomale, has directed its members to support the AD 
    candidate.
While the PDP onslaught is being co-ordinated by a former 
    Special Assistant to President, Chief Bode Oyedele, the AD 
    resistance force is being motivated by the AC chieftains.
There is also a solid alliance among AD, AC and other 26 
    political parties under the aegis of the Lagos State chapter of the 
    Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP).
Many of the PDP leaders rely on the voting pattern of the 
    constituency in their calculations. For example, while AC won the 
    House of Representatives seat in 2007, PDP won the two Assembly 
    slots.
On the other hand, the AD/AC alliance is banking on the power 
    incumbency and the performance of the AC-led government in the 
    state.
Besides, the AC family is not complacent. Chieftains from the 55 
    local councils may be lending moral and financial support to their 
    counterparts in the two Ibeju-Lekki councils, sources said.
Two weeks ago, the South-West PDP campaign 
    trail rolled into Akodo, a Lagos 
    suburb, to drum up support for Soniyi. Three governors; Olagunsoye 
    Oyinlola (Osun State), Gbenga Daniel (Ogun) and Adebayo Alao-Akala 
    (Oyo) took time off state duty to attend the rally. The Lagos PDP 
    train was led by former National Deputy Chairman of the party Chief 
    Bode George.
The PDP governors turned the campaign into an ego war. Lamenting 
    the failure of their'capture' theory in 
    2003 and 2007, they impressed it on their members to re-launch the 
    bid tomorrow by wining the 
    Ibeju-Lekki seat.
Oyinlola, Daniel and Akala campaigned in apparent trepidation at 
    the move by progressives to half their dominance in 2011. They 
    tried to re-invent the mainstream option. They failed to hinge 
    their arguments on the performances of the PDP-led Federal 
    Government since it assumed power in the last 10 years of unbroken 
    democracy. Perhaps, there was nothing to celebrate, or they were to 
    far in-between, or both.
A lot of salvos were fired at former Lagos State Governor Bola 
    Tinubu who frustrated the PDP moves to hijack power in the 
    much-coveted Centre of Excellence since 1999. They were unanimous 
    in their belief that what they could not achieve at the state level 
    could begin with tomorrow’s by-election in Ibeju-Lekki.
After the PDP campaign, AD went back to the drawing board. The 
    chairman, Alhaji Lateef Raji, wrote a letter to the progressive 
    leaders in the South-West, urging them to support the party’s 
    candidate.
Raji later told reporters in Bogije, Ibeju-Lekki, that he 
    proposed an alliance with other like-minded parties to save the 
    constituency from peril.
""Should PDP win Ibeju-Lekki, they will draw the local 
    government and constituency backward and Ibeju-Lekki would be left 
    behind in the march of progress,"" he said.
Perhaps that was the elixir the CNPP needed. It swung into 
    action. Their leaders traversed the nooks and cranny of the 
    constituency, explaining to voters the import of the by-election 
    and implications for the future.
""It is a door-to-door campaign and we see the eagerness of 
    the prospective voters in the towns and villages to endorse AD on 
    Saturday,"" said Remi Adeyemo, AD Publicity Secretary.
At an AD rally in Ibere Kudi Primary School, on Wednesday, were 
    Tinubu; AD national chairman, Chief Michael Koleoso; Speaker of the 
    House of Assembly, Adeyemi Ikuforiji, and his deputy, Mrs Funmi 
    Tejuoso.
Others included Senator Adeleke Mamora; a member of the House of 
    Representatives, Mrs. Abike Dabiri and Lagos AC 
    Vice-Chairman Cardinal James Odunmbaku.
Tinubu, who said he was at the rally on the invitation of like 
    minds, noted that the poll is another struggle between the 
    progressives and the conservatives.
""The vote on Saturday is a vote for independence. It is not 
    about Ibeju-Lekki alone. It is about Lagos State"", he said, 
    adding that PDP governors held a panic rally because they feared a 
    looming defeat.
Echoing him, Ikuforiji said the PDP’s rigging plan has been 
    uncovered. He urged the people to vote and defend their votes.
""They are threatening that they want to hijack Ibeju-Lekki. 
    They are lying,"" he added.
Lagos State CNPP leader Akinola Obajuwa also warned against 
    malpractices.
""We, the leaders and members of CNPP have assured the AD 
    chairman (Raji) that we will vote for Jamiu Eletu. He is the choice 
    of the people. We ask you, people, defend your votes. We ask you to 
    also reject the money PDP will offer,"" Obajuwa said.
Raji educated the voters on the voting behaviour. He urged them 
    to come to the polling centres early for accreditation and shun 
    unruly behaviour..
Lagos State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Mr. 
    Moses Ogbeh has promised to conduct a free and fair election.
""We are making a solid arrangement. Security would be 
    available too. This is a by-election, but we are preparing as if it 
    as a general election. We shall conduct a free and fair election 
    ,"" he said.

NigerianEnglish,may,"It’s all part of being a teenager, it only shows we hadn’t yet matured enough to know that feelings can be put into perspectives and someone who desires you, may not necessarily be in love with you",epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,SkHo_10,"Define your relationship to avoid putting blames on 
    others
Before I settled down to write this piece, it seemed to me as if 
    every subject affecting sistas had been 
    exhausted. Can you imagine that?
So, it was almost becoming impossible for sisters to hear from 
    me this week until I listened to Esther’s story and suddenly, it 
    dawned on me that any piece to save a single soul from taking her 
    own life is worth writing about.
I really do empathise with Esther but for heaven’s sake, how can 
    someone ever think of taking her own life? I’m trying as much as 
    possible not to sound disparaging, but not without saying that I 
    find the idea repulsive.
At one point or the other as teenagers, most of us had assumed 
    that some guys somewhere cared about us even when they hadn’t 
    actually asked. Fine! It’s all part of being a teenager, it only 
    shows we hadn’t yet matured enough to know that feelings can be put 
    into perspectives and someone who desires you, may not necessarily 
    be in love with you.
Perhaps you have heard this saying, but if you haven’t, let me 
    give you the opportunity to know that, ""Assumption is 
    the mother of ignorance."" About five years ago, a lady 
    I knew met this guy on her way to work. Somehow, they became 
    friends and got closer by each day.
Ope would always meet Shola at the same spot she had met him for 
    the first time and would offer to drop her at work. Soon, he 
    started showering her with gifts. I was working at that time in the 
    same complex as Shola. So, somehow, we became inseparable friends. 
    Our friendship went beyond our work place and soon we started 
    visiting each other at home. She was a nice person, very 
    hardworking and my parents liked her so much. She was living with 
    her guardians. They were very good to her but of course, she would 
    have wished she were in my shoes. She would have wished she was 
    living with her parents too. Like they say, the grass is always 
    greener on the other side.
Shola was lucky to have had Mr. and Mrs. Olajide 
    as her guardians but all that didn’t mean anything to her because 
    as far as she was concerned, she did most of the house chores while 
    their children would busy themselves with their personal things.
I remember she told me once that she couldn’t wait to get 
    married and move in with her husband. I advised her against rushing 
    into anything and that there was nothing wrong in doing most of the 
    house chores as she would do them all by herself when she is 
    married and have her children. I lived with my parents and I did 
    all the house chores too in my house and she knew it.
I wish people will learn not to see marriage as an escape valve 
    from any situation because I bet you, the person you’re running to, 
    may turn out to be your worst nightmare.
Shola paid regular visits to Ope’s house and she talked about 
    marriage more regularly. It started to bother me because she was 
    rushing things from what I perceived. I often threw questions at 
    her concerning Ope’s past relationships and I realised that she 
    already assumed the coast was clear for her since she never came 
    across another lady whenever she visited Ope.
One day, Ope visited her and she was busy. So, she asked me to 
    keep him company. In a few while we got talking. We talked about 
    things generally and we also talked about marriage plans. He said 
    he wasn’t ready to rush things because he had done so in the past. 
    I was surprised at his disclosure. Don’t ask me why?
I try to tell my friend to really dig into his last relationship 
    but she was too afraid to bring it up maybe for the fear that she 
    might rock the boat. It was a lot more convenient for her not to 
    mention it since every moment with him was pleasing. How long can 
    one live in a fool’s paradise simply because it is pleasing to do 
    so?
Shola eventually got pregnant for Ope. This time, it was not her 
    choice to hear the truth but she heard it. Ope did not take her in 
    just like she thought. I ask her what his reaction was when she 
    told him about her pregnancy. She said he asked her to keep it.
Her guardians were very disappointed in her when they found out 
    that she was pregnant. I met Ope after her guardians demanded to 
    see him and asked him what his plans were for Shola. Right in front 
    of Shola, he said he was married and his wife was in school in Ondo 
    State, that they had a quarrel and that was why she had stayed away 
    for long but that they were not divorced. He said when she told him 
    she was pregnant; he had asked her to do whatever she deemed 
    fit.
Shola was surprised to hear his man talk the way he did. Well, 
    she was yet to see the worst side of him until it was time for her 
    to be delivered of the baby.
Shola’s guardians had tried all they could to reach Ope on phone 
    after she had been taken to the hospital on that fateful day but to 
    no avail. He absconded and till date, Shola had been responsible 
    for her child alone.
Back to Esther’s case who resides in the Eastern part of the 
    country. She had lived with her guardians too and they were so nice 
    to her.
Esther is a very beautiful girl. She has the right curves in the 
    right places. Even before she finished secondary school, men 
    wouldn’t let her be. She had this neighbour, Abu, with whom she got 
    along well. They became very close friends and she usually confided 
    in him.
Just about the same time when she got admission into the 
    university, Abu also relocated to Lagos to look for job. Three 
    months after, he got a very good job, got a car and an apartment 
    for himself.
Abu and Esther kept in touch all the while. He was like a big 
    brother to her and a relationship was the last thing on her mind. 
    In her second year in school, Abu invited her to Lagos to come and 
    spend part of her semester holiday with him. She obliged him and 
    came from school to his house during their break.
When she arrived on that fateful Saturday morning, Abu was just 
    getting out of bed. They spent all day gisting. After dinner that 
    evening, Abu retired into the living-room. Esther finished her 
    dinner, hoping to come and join him in the living-room to watch the 
    evening News. But to her amazement, he was watching an ex-rated 
    movie (blue film). She was speechless. He asked her to join him if 
    she didn’t mind. She had barely sat for three minutes when she 
    realised that she was horny. She quickly got up and went into the 
    toilet to clean up and to compose herself before Abu noticed her. 
    As she opened the door, she saw Abu standing stark naked in front 
    of the door, his manhood stretching out hard before him. Before she 
    could protest, she found herself in his arm. ""I enjoyed every 
    bit of it and it didn’t stop after that first time,"" she 
    confided in me.
He didn’t make any commitment that first day and he still didn’t 
    for the whole week I spent in his house but I just assumed he 
    wanted a relationship and that was it. I didn’t ask any questions 
    because I wasn’t even prepared to hear otherwise.
Esther came visiting the second time but this time the story was 
    different. As she got to the door to Abu’s apartment, she heard 
    voices and pulse to figure out what it was. He was in a hot 
    argument with a lady. She was pregnant and he was denying the 
    pregnancy. She summoned courage and entered as the door wasn’t 
    locked. She met him beating the young girl mercilessly. She tried 
    to stop him but she couldn’t. After he was satisfied, he left 
    her.
The girl refused to leave. She went into his bedroom and slept 
    off. Esther slept in another room but Abu came and dragged her into 
    his room where the other girl was sleeping and made love to her 
    right beside the girl.
The following day, Esther left for school. While in school, 
    Esther discovered she was pregnant for Abu and had to come back to 
    Lagos to tell him about it. When she finished, he didn’t say 
    anything to her. She stayed a few days more but for every slightest 
    provocation Abu would beat her. She couldn’t take it again and 
    decided she was going back to school.
Abu took ill the morning she was supposed to leave. It was 
    really bad; she had to help him to the hospital. The doctor called 
    both of them into his office and began to counsel them before 
    eventually telling Abu that he was infected with HIV. Esther almost 
    collapsed right there on the spot. After the doctor had revived 
    her, he counseled her and they left.
Now, Esther’s world has changed. She has not been able to 
    forgive herself. ""I am going to commit suicide but before I 
    do, I will teach men a lesson. I will spread the virus for little 
    or no cost and when I’m satisfied, I will end this miserable life 
    of mine,"" she said.
Let’s even assume that Abu catch the deadly disease, she would 
    still have been hurt. He is already known with a woman, who claimed 
    to be pregnant for him and he is also a wife beater.
You need to clearly define your relationship. If you’re friendly 
    with someone and you start to notice a change in his attitude, 
    don’t just assume he wants a relationship. Desire is different from 
    love.
Back to Esther, please do write in and encourage this young 
    girl. She needs all the support she can get.

NigerianEnglish,may,(d) The intervention may focus on remedial or compensatory education,epistemic,concessive,epistemic,Adm_03,"Special Education Policies in Nigeria
The genesis of special education 
    -the modification of regular education to enable the 
    handicapped to derive benefit from it - could be traced to the 
    establishment of the first school for the blind in Kano by the 
    Sudan Interior Mission (SIM) in the early forties. Between 1953 and 
    the outbreak of the Nigeria Civil War, more schools for the 
    handicapped, particularly those for the visually handicapped, the 
    hearing impaired and the mentally retarded, were established in 
    different parts of the country. This first generations of 
    institutions for the handicapped, according to Obani (1989), were 
    largely the result of efforts of dedicated Christians propelled by 
    missionary zeal. They charted the course of special education and 
    recorded modest successes with the 
    meagerresources and the small subventions from the federal 
    and regional governments. Their devotion, indefatigable spirit and 
    tenacity of purpose, largely compensated for the poor funding and 
    inadequacy of equipment. The role of the government was minimal 
    during this phase of development. There was no clear-cut policy of 
    government except, a few terse provision of dormant legislations in 
    some parts of the country (Obani, 1989). The education of the 
    handicapped according to Obani was treated as a welfare service 
    rather than a national investment and as a 
    priviledge rather than a duty 
    for government.
With the end of the civil war in 1970 came the oil boom and the 
    second phase of development of education for the handicapped. The 
    government started to play an increasing role in the special 
    education sector. This resulted in the establishment of many 
    schools for the handicapped in all the states of the federation, 
    but many without proper planning and adequate staffing. Moreover, 
    departments for the training of special educators were established 
    in both Ibadan and Jos universities. The Federal College for 
    special education was also established.
Another important phenomenon of this phase is the enunciation of 
    a definite policy on special education contained in Section 8 of 
    the National Policy on Education (1977), revised in (1981).
In this section, the purpose of special education is clearly 
    stated and this includes the provision of adequate education for 
    all handicapped children and adults so that they can contribute to 
    national development (para. 55 b), the policy also 
    identifies integration as the most realistic form of special 
    education since handicapped children are eventually expected to 
    live in the society (para. 56(5).
The Philosophy of Special Education
The National Policy on Education has these as the purpose and 
    objectives of special education:
(a) To give concrete meaning to the ideas of equalising 
    educational opportunities for all children, their physical, mental, 
    emotional disabilities not-withstanding.
(b) To provide adequate education for all handicapped children 
    and adults in order that they may fully play their roles in the 
    development of the nation.
(c) To provide opportunities for exceptionally gifted children 
    to develop at their own pace in the interest of the nation's 
    economic and technological development.
Section 8 of the policy highlighted governments intention in 
    this form:
(1) Sub section 56 (1) the Federal Government will set up a 
    committee to co-ordinate Special Education activities in 
    collaboration with the Ministries of Health, Social Welfare and 
    Labour.
(2) A census will be taken of all handicapped children and 
    adults by age, sex, locality and type.
(3) The government accepts the responsibility for making 
    provision for training teachers in Special Education as well as the 
    supportive staff required by the school, colleges, clinics and 
    centres in this area.
(4) The government has decided that integration is the most 
    realistic form of Special Education, since handicapped children are 
    eventually expected to live in the society.
(5) The education of the handicapped will be free at all levels, 
    up to the University level where possible.
(6) Vocational schools will be made to reserve places for 
    further education of handicapped children and adults - government 
    will provide suitable employment opportunities for the handicapped 
    workers.
(7) Children clinic will be attached to most hospitals for early 
    identification of the handicapped children, and for curative 
    measures and medical care before and after the age of primary 
    schooling.
(8) Ministries of Health, Education, Social Welfare, Social 
    Development and Labour will work jointly on most programmes for 
    handicapped children, and the National Council on Special Education 
    will be composed to reflect this collective responsibility.
Strengths of the Policy
There is no doubt that this policy which has identified central 
    issues in special education has some strengths.
1. The National Policy on Education (NPE) represents the most 
    comprehensive and most far-reaching education policy ever devised 
    in Nigeria. This view finds support from Thakur (1983), Nwaogu 
    (1988), Osokoya (1989) and Nkangwung (1994). Thakur (1983), for 
    instance, described it as the first comprehensive document produced 
    since the beginning of the Western type of schooling in Nigeria. 
    Education policies before now, as Nkangwung (1994) puts it, had 
    limited concern geographically and in the programmes. Unlike the 
    previous policies, this new policy was developed in Nigeria by 
    Nigerians to cater for the needs of Nigerians.
2. It also represents an articulation between education and 
    national objectives. The policy sees education as a means for 
    achieving national objectives which are identified as the building 
    of:
• a free and democratic society
• a just and egalitarian society
• a united, strong and self-reliant nation
• a great and dynamic economy
• a land of bright and full opportunities
for all citizens (NPE, 1981). Both in concept and design, this 
    new system can be seen as a radical departure from the former 
    British implemented education system in Nigeria which was guided by 
    the imperial utilitarian considerations (Osokoya, 1989).
3. Education is seen as a right of the citizen not a 
    priviledge of the few.
4. Also noteworthy about the policy is the fact that we have for 
    the first time in Nigeria an education policy and practice that are 
    based on a definite social philosophy. This is important because 
    the planning for an appropriate education of any society should be 
    done in relation to the social ideals - philosophy of the society 
    in question (Nkangwung, 1994).
5. Another strength of the policy and perhaps the most relevant 
    for the purpose of this paper, is its provision for the education 
    of exceptional children. The purpose and objectives of special 
    education are clearly stated in Section 8 (55) while Section 8 (56) 
    specifies the ways and means by which the government intends to 
    achieve the stated objectives. Nwaogu (1988) also reported that the 
    National Policy on Education envisages that:
(a) Special Education will lead to early detection of students 
    with learning problems.
(b) Identification will lead to early intervention.
(c) It will help to provide adequate knowledge of a child's 
    characteristics, aptitudes, interests, strength and weaknesses and 
    ensure adaptation of materials and programme to the benefit of the 
    student.
(d) The intervention may focus on remedial or compensatory 
    education.
(e) Knowledge about the causes of handicapped conditions and 
    their attendant learning problems will help bring about changes in 
    people's attitudes that are rooted in ignorance and 
    superstition.
(f) The use of individualized instruction methods will ensure 
    proper selection of materials, assessment criteria evaluation and 
    grading.
(g) Teachers to be produced for Special Education are those who 
    have vision, who are responsive, perceptive, alert and thorough in 
    their duties towards children.
Weaknesses of the Policy
1. The aims of education are not consistent at all levels of 
    education, for example, national integration is an aim of education 
    only at the secondary level.
2. There is too much presence of government in the policy with 
    the result that private initiative is stifled.
3. Another inconsistency in the policy is the area of support or 
    control of education. At the pre-primary level, the policy allows 
    for private participation while the primary level largely enjoys 
    public control. The control at the secondary level is both private 
    and public but at the tertiary level only public participation is 
    allowed. If there is value in private participation in education, 
    it should run through all levels of education (Adedoja and 
    Ajobiewe, 1996).
4. The policy has taken more than the Nigerian government can 
    achieve. It has gone beyond the enunciation of policy statements to 
    embrace the details that only practitioners could work out 
    (Nkangwung, 1994).
Implementation - Main Issues
It is apparent that Section 8 provides the directional policies 
    of special education in Nigeria. It is a well-intended policy which 
    has not been pragmatically pursued (Obiakor, Maltby and Ihunnah, 
    1990). Recent studies by Ihunnah (1984) and Oluigbo (1985) have 
    made salient revelations. Ihunnah (1984) for instance, used a 
    survey research design methodology to study improvements in special 
    education facilities, enrolment, and manpower in Nigeria. His 
    discoveries included the following:
• There has been an increase in the number of qualified teaching 
    personnel in special education. Student's enrolment is not 
    commensurate with teacher preparation.
• Established mechanisms for policy implementation are not 
    consistently enforced.
• There is a lack of specialised consultants and qualified 
    educational planners in strategic areas etc.
Co-ordination
In 1976, the Federal Ministry of Education gave the following 
    provisional guidelines to states: State Ministries of Education 
    should be responsible for Special Education programmes in their 
    states, this is to include planning, supervision, and finance (FME 
    circular, 1976). However, there is no record to show that the 
    committee has been formed. The implication is that programmes for 
    the disabled in Nigeria remain uncoordinated. (Adedoja & 
    Ajobiewe, 1996).
Census
Another important clause in the National Policy concerns the 
    need for a census of all handicapped children and adults and the 
    attaching of children's clinics to most hospitals for early 
    identification of handicapped children, and the provision of 
    curative measures and medical care. The 1991 census figure revealed 
    that Nigeria has a population of 88.5 million. Using the 
    United Nations projection of one in every ten persons in a 
    population to be disabled, it is estimated that there are 8.8 million disabled Nigerians. However, there is no breaking of 
    this figure to each category of the handicapped. A critical 
    examination of the policy revealed that there was no structured 
    programmes or provision for the early detention of handicaps in 
    Nigerian children, and although some routine health programmes do 
    identify and refer a few cases, there was a general lack of special 
    facilities and personnel for early detection and treatment of 
    individuals with handicap. As regards the children's clinics, 
    only very few isolated cases were recorded. Some supportive 
    services to the handicapped and their families are available 
    through child guidance clinics in few states, e.g. 
    Lagos State. These are obviously inadequate.
Integration issue
Despite the laudable intentions expressed nearly two decades 
    ago, integration of exceptional children cannot be said to have 
    achieved any considerable success in Nigeria. The apparent failure 
    of integration, as Nkangwung (1994) puts it, has affected special 
    education adversely. According to the author, not only has it 
    deprived our special children, especially in the rural areas who 
    have no access to the few special school located mainly in the 
    cities, the opportunity and the advantages derivable from 
    integration. It is better that the handicapped children are not 
    uprooted from their homes, families and communities. The government 
    should do much more to encourage integration schemes; it is 
    essential that they take root and flourish if the vast majority of 
    Nigeria's handicapped children are to receive any 
    education.

NigerianEnglish,may,A little bleeding may continue for several days and is usually not serious,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,PNsc_07,"Post-Partum Hemorrhage (PPH)
A joke Bello, 32, gave birth to the first set of sextuplets in 
    Nigeria in February this year. The woman was delivered of the 
    babies by Caesarean Section (C.S). But she developed 
    complications from excessive bleeding at the Olabisi Onabanjo 
    University Teaching Hospital in Sagamu, Ogun State where she gave 
    birth to the babies. She gave birth on Thursday and died on 
    Sunday.
According to figures from the World Health Organization (WHO), 
    published in 2007, Nigeria’s maternal mortality rate is the second 
    highest in the world, after India.
Over half a million women die during childbirth annually around 
    the world, according to the WHO, and Nigeria alone accounts for 10 
    per cent of these deaths.
The rate at which Nigerian women die after giving birth is 
    alarmingly on the increase. The most common cause of maternal 
    mortality in Nigeria today is excessive bleeding after birth which 
    is also known as Post Partum Hemorrhage (PPH).
Dr Abdul Lateef A. Imran of Beachland Specialist 
    Hospital, Arepo, Ibafo, Ogun State, speaking to The 
    Nation, said: ""On a yearly basis, there is more than 
    half a million women who die of PPH. About 80 per cent of the 
    deaths happen in the developing countries, one of which is 
    Nigeria.""
He described PPH as bleeding that is 500mls or more after a 
    woman has been delivered of a baby.
In an extract from Derek LLeweyn Jones’ 
    Everywoman, it is stated that, ""Most 
    women lose between 300 and 800ml of blood after their baby is born. 
    This is of little consequence, as during pregnancy, the woman’s 
    blood volume increases by at least one liter.
""However, if the woman is anaemic, has a forceps 
    delivery, or a caesarian section or has a multiple pregnancy, the 
    blood loss may be serious.""
David Werner, author of Where There is No 
    Doctor, stated that, ""When the placenta comes 
    out, there is always a brief flow of blood. It normally lasts only 
    a few minutes and not more than a quarter of a liter (one cup) of 
    blood is lost. A little bleeding may continue for several days and 
    is usually not serious. Bleeding can often be slowed down by 
    putting the baby to the breast.
""Sometimes, a woman may be bleeding severely inside 
    without much blood coming out. If it seems her stomach is getting 
    bigger, it may be filling with blood.""
Dr Imran identified what usually lead to PPH in the tropics as 
    anaemia. ""Women in the tropics are prone to PPH because most 
    of them are anaemic, even before pregnancy. Most of them have been 
    having below PCV of 30 per cent because of poor nutrition, frequent 
    pregnancy and delivery. Most of them do not wait to recover from 
    previous birth before conceiving again. They do not give adequate 
    spacing. Within a year, they have taken in again, the iron 
    deficiency they suffer from in the last pregnancy, they have not 
    even recovered before going into another pregnancy.""
He further said that, ""In Nigeria, most of the citizens 
    live in the rural areas where they do not have access to 
    qualitative healthcare and skilled personnel. Most of the women 
    would have lost a lot of blood before getting to the right place 
    where they can be attended to. While getting to that place, the 
    frustration of the health system itself and the bureaucracy of the 
    hospital (register, pay, wait for doctor etc.) can frustrate 
    the patient. This is coupled with the fact that the financial power 
    of women is so low. Most women have to wait for their husbands to 
    come before taking a financial decision or get support, even to be 
    able to get a good hospital.""
The Ibafo-based gynecologist said that there are many things 
    that can cause PPH, but atony is the commonest. Atony is a 
    situation where the uterus fails to contract after birth. He said, 
    ""The mechanism that makes bleeding stops is contraction of the 
    uterus, which narrows the vessel at the placenta where the bleeding 
    is coming from and form a clot, Once 
    that is in place, there would not be abnormal bleeding.""
He said further, ""The women who are at a risk of atony are 
    women who have fibroid. It dispenses the uterus and make it 
    difficult for it to contract very well. Also, any condition that 
    leads to enlargement of the womb in the uterus, beyond necessary, 
    like when you have multiple gestation, (twins, triplet, sextuplet, 
    octuplet) the uterus over extended and this does not make the 
    uterus to contract very well, thereby causing bleeding.""
Imran continued by saying that Infection can also cause PPH. 
    Infection occurs when there is product of conception left in the 
    womb, no matter how little. According to him, 
    It will not allow the uterus to contract very well, at the 
    same time, causing a lot of bleeding.
He also said, women who have had multiple scars; either from 
    previous termination of pregnancy or other surgical procedure such 
    as fibroid or caesarian. All 
    these leave scars in the womb. When a placenta is near the scar, it 
    does not shed out easily.
He related the death of women who die from childbirth bleeding 
    with the incompetent hands they often go to for delivery. ""For 
    medical personnel who do not know how to manage this, they will 
    just pull out the placenta and the thing will come out in pieces. 
    All those ones that are left behind will continue to bleed"", 
    he said.
Most of the time, he said further, it happens in the maternity 
    home, traditional birth attendance (TBA) home and they would not 
    know what to do. To make matters worse, the patient would not be 
    referred on time, until it is too late, and the patient will just 
    die like that.""
In continuation, he said that, for a woman to survive it, she 
    has to get to the right place at the right time. If the doctor and 
    midwives can not detect it on time, he said, they will not know 
    what to do. He observed that, those who die as a result of PPH do 
    so because they die in an unskilled hand, either in a church, 
    clinics, herbal home or even with midwives and nurses who have 
    centers all over the place. That is why it is a problem in the 
    developing nation.
In continuation of what cause PPH, Imran said, ""Ruptured 
    uterus, this occurs in women who have 
    ceasarian Section before, but who want to deliver normally 
    at the next opportunity. At times, the uterus can rupture, and if 
    it is not noticed, the woman will just be bleeding continuously. 
    For instance, women who have had two or three deliveries, go to TBA 
    home, and the midwives there apply pressure by climbing on the 
    woman and pressing her stomach from above, so that the baby can 
    come out. In the process, they sometimes rupture the uterus. After 
    the baby is out, the woman will just continue to bleed. If the 
    woman is not taken to the right place, at the right time, she could 
    bleed to death.""
He said that, there is primary and secondary PPH. It happens 
    within 24 hours of delivery, especially from infection. The person 
    does not start bleeding immediately. Secondary PPH is an infection 
    from the retained products. It is not immediate. In this case, the 
    woman would have delivered, she might have even gotten home, and on 
    the third day, she will just discover that she has started bleeding 
    seriously. If there is any product left, bacteria will act on it, 
    then she will start bleeding.
To combat PPH, Jones, the author of 
    Everywoman said, ""In most hospitals, 
    an injection of a drug which makes the uterus contract is given as 
    the baby is born. This method has reduced the risk of PPH 
    considerably. If bleeding continues, there are now new drugs to 
    combat it, and the doctor may put a hand inside the uterus to make 
    sure that no pieces of placenta remain, as these could be causing 
    the bleeding.""
Werner of Where there is no doctor also added 
    that, ""To help prevent or control heavy bleeding, let 
    the baby suck the mother’s breast. This will cause her to produce a 
    hormone (pituitrin) that helps control bleeding.""
Imran contributed by saying, ""The doctor has to be ready 
    for that by doing all sorts of things to ensure the contraction of 
    the uterus, otherwise, the woman will continue to bleed.""
Imran said that PPH can be managed if the person in charge is 
    able to recognise the situation at hand. ""Management starts 
    from anticipation. So, when you see somebody, who is probably in 
    her 40s with five or seven deliveries, the physician would have 
    anticipated that, when she delivers, there might be bleeding, so 
    plans must be ready to tackle it if it occurs,"" he said.
He explained, ""If you do not anticipate a problem, you will 
    not quickly find a solution during emergency. It will happen before 
    you know it. But, when you anticipate problems, by knowing the 
    women at risk; fibroid, multiple pregnancy, multiparity, 
    over-enlarged uterus, then, the health expert will watch out for 
    it.""
In order to decrease the number of women affected by PPH, Imran 
    mentioned some signs that will be noticed so that the woman can get 
    help and survive, if possible. ""When you lose blood, the body 
    wants to compensate for it, and one of the compensation mechanisms 
    is that, the pulse rate will increase, and that means, the heart 
    rate will increase too, and with time, the woman starts flaring the 
    womb, becomes weak (no stamina to do anything), develops features 
    of heart failure, legs will be swollen, congesting accumulation of 
    veins in the lungs, person would not be able to lie down flat, and 
    so on.""
Imran noted that ""PPH is preventable if the woman register 
    in a good health service place and deliver in a skilled hand.
""One of the problems doctors face with pregnancy is that a 
    woman might be registered in a place, but due to labour pains and 
    unavailability of a transportation at the oddest hour, she will be 
    taken to the next available hospital/clinic around. Even in some 
    situations, she delivers at home or inside the vehicle taking her 
    to the hospital.
""Doctors do not like to operate on a woman, and she starts 
    bleeding, he will be faced with the dilemma of either to remove the 
    uterus to save her life (knowing fully well that she will not 
    conceive again). If there is delay, she will continue to be weak 
    and by the time the doctor finalises the decision on removing the 
    uterus, it is already late. So, these are the dilemmas we face as 
    surgeons. For instance, somebody who is just delivering for the 
    first time, and you are removing the uterus, or worse still, the 
    baby is not alive, the doctor will definitely be reluctant to 
    remove the uterus to stop the 
    bleeding.
PPH will lead to death if it is poorly managed.
Dr Imran concluded by saying, ""We need blood to survive or 
    live if a woman is bleeding continuously, the total blood volume in 
    the body is 3.5 litres. So if a woman releases 500ml per 
    minute then, there will be need for an urgent attention.""

NigerianEnglish,may,Bacteria hide well in between the molar teeth which may receive less attention than the front teeth during brushing,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,SkHo_07,"Controlling body odour
You step out of your place in the queue at your bank. You had 
    thought you would put up with it but your resistance breaks down. 
    The woman in front of you and the man behind you have something in 
    common. They have not been kind to their own arm pits.
You had planned for a two-hour stretch in the library and you 
    were tucked into your books. Suddenly, there is bad odour. You look 
    under the table and the handsome guy across from you had slipped 
    off his shoes. Bye to library. Your colleague is enthusiastically 
    explaining the circulated memo to you at close range and you shut 
    her up – quickly! You are nagging your driver in spite of his 
    petting you with ""Mummy"", ""Madam"" and a 
    thousand ""Ma"". The truth is you hate being sealed up in 
    your car air conditioning with his body odour. In the quiet of your 
    sitting room, you initiated an impromptu dance with your 
    girlfriend. You cut it off sooner than expected because her hair 
    was not fresh.
Body odour (B.O.) is unpleasant smell from the 
    body. It is irritating and repulsive and it can make people 
    spiteful towards the bearer. It is caused by excretions and 
    bacterial action on secreted body fluids and it is especially a 
    problem in tropical areas where bacterial action can be rapid. 
    Refinement is not a privilege of rich and educated people. It does 
    require some effort but it is not necessarily expensive. Everybody 
    – from cleaner and market woman to university professor and 
    business magnate, young and old, illiterate and educated, rich and 
    poor – can enjoy personal refinement without much cost.
Refinement helps us to have good relationships with others. When 
    we lack refinement, it can bring out the worst in people (though a 
    virtuous person would show tolerance and kindness towards everyone 
    in spite of people’s lack of refinement).
Within the family, starting from husband and wife, romance 
    disappears, fun diminishes and tempers set in when partners cannot 
    enjoy each other’s company and closeness. The family’s physical and 
    mental health can be affected by lack of care in controlling 
    odours. We need to take care of our bodies as well as our 
    environments. In Nigeria, lack of water and lack of electricity can 
    compound our efforts.
The body areas of concern are the scalp (for black women), the 
    mouth, the arm pits, the genital areas, and the feet. These areas 
    typically harbour moisture from sweat and small but mighty microbes 
    that thrive in such moisture. The microbes include bacteria and 
    fungi and we need to learn how to not give them a chance. Personal 
    habits, cleanliness of our environment including the air, and using 
    medical remedies are all important for controlling body odour.
Habits include regular ""cures"" such as manicure and 
    pedicure, teeth flossing, hair dressing and daily grooming. 
    Generally, prevention is better than cure. Dirt should be removed 
    not covered up. Spraying perfume to cover smell is not hygienic. 
    The effort should be to keep bacterial and fungal action under 
    control. Washing oneself well and then enhancing freshness with 
    perfume makes us pleasant. Too much perfume can distract or disturb 
    others. In the tropics, bathing twice daily is common habit. 
    Changing clothes, especially undergarments after each use instead 
    of repeating them before washing is important.
Black women with permed hair sometimes insist of keeping a style 
    till it wears out. This may be too many days during which sweat and 
    bacterial and fungal action can accumulate odour. Women therefore 
    need to have alternative ways of presenting their hair: styling, 
    washing and packing, as well as effectively using head-ties, 
    attachments, and wigs alternatively with hair styling. Thus they 
    can maintain beauty without compromising hygiene.
Teeth may be brushed several times a day with freshening paste: 
    early in the morning to regain freshness, after major meals to 
    limit plaque build-up, and before going to bed to minimize 
    bacterial action during sleep. The tongue accumulates layers of 
    food debris and should be brushed also. The back of the tongue is a 
    hideout for microbes and should be reached by the brush. Occasional 
    gargling with 1:.10 dilution of 3 per cent hydrogen peroxide 
    (sold in pharmacies) also keeps the stubborn bacterial flora of 
    this region low. Hydrogen peroxide is for external use and should 
    not be swallowed. If accidentally swallowed drink excess water and 
    see your doctor. The between-teeth areas are also bacterial havens 
    and can be reached with tooth picks and dental floss regularly. 
    Bacteria hide well in between the molar teeth which may receive 
    less attention than the front teeth during brushing. Care should be 
    taken to brush the molar teeth well. During the day, drinking small 
    amounts of water every couple of hours helps to flow off bacteria 
    which will pass into the stomach and be destroyed by stomach acid. 
    Mouth odor that accumulates during silent work may thus be reduced. 
    Talking every now and then rather than keeping the mouth shut for 
    hours and singing occasionally helps to vent the lungs, throat, and 
    mouth, clearing odour.
Bacteria love the warm and moist areas of the arm pits. Keeping 
    the hair cleared or low is helpful. Washing with soap may not be 
    adequate. These areas may need regular gentle scrubbing with raffia 
    or other type of sponge to remove dead skin and bacteria around the 
    hair follicles. After bathing, if the armpits are rubbed with a few 
    drops of 50-70 per cent alcohol (sold in pharmacies) or 
    ""spirit"" they can remain fresh for most of the day, even 
    with heavy sweating. Sweat alone is usually odorless. It is 
    bacterial action that fouls it. Alcohol kills the bacteria and 
    therefore your sweat stays odorless without enough bacteria to foul 
    it.
Bacteria also love the warm and moist genital areas. These areas 
    are too sensitive to alcohol. The feminine clefts should be 
    accessed during bathing and washed with soap. Scrubbing of the 
    female delicate skin can lead to damage. Scrubbing is helpful in 
    removing dead skin and cleaving bacteria from the anal and scrotal 
    regions. A little disinfectant in bathing water is helpful for 
    antibacterial protection of the genital areas. For most parts of 
    the body keeping bacteria low also keeps fungi off as fungi are 
    often opportunists, capitalizing on areas where bacteria have 
    invaded and lowered the body’s barriers.
Underwear should be changed as needed and in the tropics, cotton 
    material (rather than synthetics) is useful good body ventilation 
    and for easily soaking up sweat and allowing it to be 
    
    evaporated.Underwear should not be repeated before washing. 
    These habits limit our vulnerability to genital disease-causing 
    organisms that can be picked up in public facilities. Even the air 
    in these areas can be loaded with microbial pores. There is no real 
    danger if we have hygienic habits because these microbes won’t have 
    a chance to thrive on our bodies
The feet need daily scrubbing. The nails need occasional 
    pedicure to remove dirt, bacteria, and fungus under the nails and 
    around the nails. Occasionally (once a month) the feet should be 
    soaked in water with added disinfectant for 10-30 minutes. This 
    soaking kills bacteria hiding in areas not reached by daily 
    scrubbing. It also softens callous skin and this can be removed by 
    gentle scraping. If this is not done, the microbes react with sweat 
    and dead skin and create a pungent odour. Shoes should be aired 
    when taken off. The inside of shoes should be cleaned regularly 
    with a damp soapy cloth and followed by disinfectant. Avoid 
    transferring dirt and bacteria from the exterior to the interior of 
    shoes when the shoes are cleaned. Different cleaning cloths should 
    be used for the outside and the inside. Shoes can also be 
    conditioned by placing them under the hot sun after cleaning. Avoid 
    wearing closed shoes all the time in the tropics. Alternate covered 
    shoes with ventilated footwear.
Finally, the home environment if not well cleaned and 
    disinfected, can harbour bacteria, fungi, and other micro-beings 
    which cover the surfaces we touch, and their spores which fill the 
    air that we breathe.
These means for good health are accessible to all because they 
    are easy and inexpensive. They are helpful for people with mild 
    B.O. as well as those with strong B.O. 
    cased by genetic or medical 
    problems. Within the family, members can help each other out, doing 
    each other’s manicure and pedicure, shaving, hair styling, washing, 
    etc. These health habits unite spouses and siblings and enhance 
    affections and produce improved relationships. The result is better 
    physical and mental well being for all members of the family.

    Onitsha, Nigeria
INTRODUCTION
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening is carried out in 
    different contests and for very 
    different reasons. Different categories of HIV testing have varying 
    requirements concerning counseling and consent. The different 
    categories if HIV testing include:-
- Voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT)
- Routine HIV testing
- Diagnostic HIV testing
- HIV testing for blood, semen and organ donation
- HIV testing for research and surveillance
- Required (mandatory) testing1
The classic approach to HIV testing is the ""voluntary 
    counseling and testing (VCT)"". This emphasizes extensive 
    pretest counseling and focuses on social and preventive implication 
    of being HIV infected or knowing one's serostatus. In VCT the 
    decision whether to accept or reject the test rests entirely with 
    the client. VCT remains an important preservation service but there 
    was belated recognition that this model was not well adapted to the 
    needs of healthcare programmes for prevention of transmission of 
    HIV in treatment of HIV/AIDS2-3.
Routine HIV testing aims at universal diagnosis and delivery of 
    specific prevention interventions while diagnostic testing is aimed 
    at diagnosing individual patients with HIV disease. These 
    approaches have potential overlap. Since not all patients with 
    advanced HIV diseases have specific symptoms or signs, diagnostic 
    testing should be a routine activity for patients in high 
    prevalence settings.
HIV can be transmitted by contact with infected body fluids like 
    blood, tear drops and aqueous humour4. 
    In ophthalmic surgery contact with these body fluids is inevitable. 
    Amongst health workers, the commonest risk factor is needle prick 
    injury, and 1 out of every 300 needle pricks will finally lead to 
    AIDS in the absence of anti-retroviral 
    treatment5.
In this hospital some sharp instruments are unavoidably recycled 
    during surgeries. The rate of transmission of HIV has been shown to 
    be generally reduced among healthcare workers when they take 
    precautions by avoiding contact with potentially infected body 
    fluids, wearing gloves, goggles and masks when carrying out 
    clinical procedures6. Knowledge of the 
    HIV status of patients prior to surgery will reinforce appropriate 
    precautionary measures to reduce transmission.
In a hospital-based study in Ilorin7, 
    Nigeria 62% of respondents considered themselves not adequately 
    protected against HIV infection and 66.7% would not like to 
    be involved in taking care of AIDS patients. The study emphasized 
    the need for improvement of peer education/counseling and changes 
    of government policy on screening for HIV especially for high risk 
    group. The increase in the number of infected people is not 
    inevitable. Early detection and sustained prevention efforts have 
    been credited with lower rates in some countries like 
    Uganda8.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
This study aims at reviewing all surgical cases to determine the 
    importance of HIV screening association with different eye 
    diseases, age and gender of the patients and to make necessary 
    recommendations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The case files of all the patients that had surgery and HIV 
    screening or test prior to surgery from 
    1st September 2005 to 
    31st August 2006 were reviewed. Routine 
    HIV testing method was used in the patients that had surgery and 
    preoperative HIV test during the stipulated period were obtained 
    and analyzed using S.P.S.S. 
    (Statistical Package for social Scientists) computer programmed. 
    The variables considered in the analysis include age, sex, 
    diagnoses types of surgery and result of the HIV screening.
RESULTS
Ophthalmic surgery was performed on 389 patients within the 
    period of study. HIV screening was carried out on 32 
    7(84.1 %) of the operated 
    patients. Eighteen (5.5%) patients, 
    7(2.1%) males and 1 
    1(3.4%) females tested positive for HIV. Only the 
    screened patients were included in the study. Table 1 shows Age and 
    Sex distribution of the patients screened for HIV. The highest 
    number of patients screened was 6 
    0(15.4%) in the 51 - 
    60age group. The oldest patient was 89 years while the 
    youngest was a 6 months old baby. Thirty Seven (11.3%) 
    patients were above 70 years of age. The male : female ratio was 
    1.2:1. The highest number of men and women was in the 51-60

    positive.

DISCUSSION
HIV/AIDS has constituted one of the most difficult challenges 
    for the health care professions8. There 
    is high awareness of risk among health workers in Nigeria yet it 
    does not receive an appropriate 
    attention9. This inadequate attention is 
    manifest in the poor hospital control preventive procedures against 
    the infection such as use of gloves, auto destruction of used 
    syringes and sharp objects. The classic approach of HIV testing is 
    the voluntary counseling and test (VCT) which is generally patient 
    or client initiated focusing on social and preventive implications 
    of being HIV-infected1.
In this study the routine and diagnostic HIV testing was adopted 
    for all preoperative cases reducing pretest information and 
    prioritizing post-test counseling especially for the patients found 
    to be HIV seropositive. The clinical consequences of high HIV sero 
    prevalence in such Saharan Africa 
    are by now becoming apparent to health workers but the issue of 
    voluntary and involuntary HIV screening among health care personnel 
    and patients has generated controversies as ethical and moral 
    issues10. Similar reactions followed 
    Lesotho Government's offer of or HIV test and counseling to 
    every person in the country over 12 years of age by the end of 
    200711. Some saw this as an attempt to 
    shift attitudes and normalize knowledge of HIV status, resulting in 
    earlier HIV diagnosis and tangible prevention outcomes. Others 
    raised concerns over potential human rights violations, including 
    lack of confidentiality. Despite the controversy the universal HIV 
    screening offer is still in progress.
The number of screened patients peaked at 51 - 60 years age 
    group with male preponderance, as shown in table 1. In the 51-60 
    years age group cataract constitute the major cause of blindness in 
    both Nigeria and the world and the mode of treatment is 
    surgery12,14. Cataract was found to be 
    the commonest surgical eye disease in this study as shown in table 
    2. Cataract extraction is a major ophthalmic surgery with marked 
    contact with body fluids such as blood, tears and aqueous humor. 
    These body fluids including tears and aqueous have been found to 
    contain HIV organisms4. Contact with 
    these fluids, if contaminated, can results in HIV infections 
    especially when there is an open wound. This mode of infection is 
    possible in cataract extraction where the cataract time is 
    prolonged and sharp instruments used. Eye injuries are the second 
    commonest surgical eye disease in this study as shown in table 3. 
    Most eye injuries are ophthalmic emergencies and require urgent 
    treatment. In this environment, in some cases, appropriate aseptic 
    theatre environment may not be ensured prior to surgery. Also in 
    the treatment of eye injuries contact with body fluids like blood, 
    tears and aqueous is prolonged. There situations increase the 
    chances of HIV infection incase 
    of infected patients.
It is worthy of note that nobody below age of 20 years, as shown 
    in table 2 tested positive of HIV. Sixty four (19.6%) of the 
    screened patients were below 20 years of age. This was found to be 
    statistically significant using chi-square test, P < 0.05. It is remarkable that no males 40 years and below tested 
    positive in this study as against females in whom positive result 
    was obtained from 21 years as shown in table 2. This may be 
    attributed to the fact that females become sexually mature and 
    active earlier than males in life15.
HIV positivity is more amongst females than males in this study 
    with a male:female of 1:1:6. This is at variance with the 
    male:female ratio of screened patients which is 1.2:1. This 
    therefore suggests that females are more susceptible to 
    IV infection than males. 
    Preoperative HIV screening should be ensured particularly amongst 
    females patients above 20 years of age. The presence of HIV in 
    patients above 70 years supports screening for HIV in all patients 
    no matter how old.
No child was found to have HIV in this study despite the fact 
    that Sixty four (19.8 %) of the screened patients were below 
    20 years of age. The advantage of early detection or knowing 
    one's HIV status is remarkable. In some countries like Lesotho 
    HIV screening for everybody 12 years and above have been found 
    acceptable to the populace despite the initial 
    controversy11. It is therefore 
    recommended that children should not be excluded in the routine HIV 
    laboratory screening prior to ophthalmic surgery.

NigerianEnglish,may,The higher mean Pb and Cd contents of these Chinese dry cells compared to cells from other countries ( Tables 4) may be explained by the observation that more than 90% of these cells have non-metal outer cover,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,ANsc_08,"Determination of Lead and Cadmium Contents of Dry Cell 
    Batteries Available in Nigeria
ABSTRACT: Lead and cadmium content of 
    different brands and sizes (N=38) of dry cell batteries 
    (zinc-carbon Leclanche systems) available in Nigeria were 
    determined by atomic absorption spectrometry after acid digestion. 
    The average Pb and Cd content of the dry cells are 1077.9±751.7mg/kg (Range 42-3170mg/kg) and 108.3±81.4mg/kg (Range 4.6-410mg/kg) respectively. The mean Pb and 
    Cd contents of dry cells with metal outer cover were significantly 
    lower (p < 0.005) than the corresponding values for dry 
    cells with non-metallic cover. The highest Pb and Cd values were 
    observed in dry cell batteries imported from China. Higher mean Pb 
    and Cd value were observed in dry cells from China (1368.36 
    vs. 151.47mg/kg), compared to values for dry cells 
    from Indonesia (1032 vs. 84.4mg/kg),Japan (715.2 
    vs. 131.48mg/kg) and Korea (1137.5 vs. 
    81.45). Lower Pb and Cd values were obtained in dry cells 
    from Malaysia (709 vs. 12.5mg/kg), Spain (702 vs. 65.8mg/kg), United States (303 vs. 11.1mg/kg) and in the only surviving local brand (408 vs. 
    34.5mg/kg).Our study revealed that there is an urgent need 
    to introduce an adequate well-established system for collection, 
    separation, storage and management of municipal and industrial 
    wastes containing primary and secondary battery wastes and similar 
    toxic materials to halt the open burning of such wastes within 
    inhabited areas. There is an urgent need to develop in Nigeria an 
    appropriate technology following the principles of waste 
    minimization and sustainable development.
The management of primary and secondary battery wastes is 
    essential in order to avoid or minimize inappropriate disposal 
    which may result in harm to the environment and the human health. 
    Household batteries contribute 52% of Cd and 88% of Hg found in the 
    municipal solid waste, yet they comprise less than 1% by weight of 
    municipal solid waste (Shapek, 1996) 
    .The toxicity and widespread pollution by lead is well 
    known. In fact, lead has been described as the most severe 
    environmental contaminant to arise in human civilization (Smith and 
    Flegal, 1995). Although Pb is ubiquitous in the environment Pb as a 
    pollutant is essentially of anthropogenic origin. The polluting 
    nature of the manufacturing processes of both primary and secondary 
    batteries to the environment (Ward et al., 1977; Semu et 
    al., 1986; Onianwa and Fakayode, 2000) and the adverse 
    health effect on battery industry employees and their families have 
    been established (Bader et al, 1999; Ritcher et al, 1979; Fergusson 
    et al, 1981; Oleru et al, 1983). The absence of environmental 
    protection equipment near battery and waste battery recycling 
    facilities has been associated with increase of Pb in human tissue 
    samples (Wohl et al, 1996; Bader et al, 1999). The manufacture of 
    dry cell batteries expose employees to Pb, Mn, Zn, Cd and suspended 
    carbon black dusts which usually contains polyaromatic hydrocarbons 
    (PAHs). Exposure to carbon black dust in dry cell battery 
    facilities results in significant loss in pulmonary function (Oleru 
    et al, 1983). Higher levels of Pb and Mn have been observed in the 
    body tissues of primary and secondary battery employees and their 
    family members (Bader et al, 1999; Wohl et al, 1996; Lai et al, 
    1997). The high levels of especially Pb observed in the tissue 
    samples of the employees family members reveals a problem arising 
    from employees' transferring lead dust home, probably in their 
    working cloths (Fergusson et al, 1981).
Dry cells are non-rechargeable and of single use. They 
    constitute household hazardous waste when'dead', that is when the components have reached 
    their equilibrium concentrations. The open burning of wastes 
    containing municipal and industrial wastes results in the emission 
    of heavy metals into the atmosphere with fly ash and after fallout, 
    metals in dusts and soils. This form of metal pollution have been 
    classified as an environmental transfer of metal and not a true 
    source of metallic pollutant (Ayres and Ayres, 1994).This is 
    because the metals emitted must have been originally embodied in 
    items of consumption discharged as waste. These toxic metals can be 
    leached from ash and cinder into domestic surface waters by acidic 
    wet precipitation which may result from the large-scale gas flaring 
    by the Nigerian petroleum and natural gas sector. This leaching 
    process can be enhanced by charges in pH, redox potential and the 
    presence of organic chelators. Highly acidic pH of 3.4 has 
    been observed in some natural surface waters in industrial areas of 
    Nigeria (Sridhar and Bammeke, 1986). Such acidic pH can enhance the 
    mobility of metals. The major streams in the industrial cities of 
    Nigeria are already seriously polluted by industrial waste (Ajayi 
    and Osibanjo, 1981) and pesticide residues (Nwankwoala and 
    Osibanjo, 1992). The aim of the present study was to determine the 
    Pb and Cd contents of dry cell batteries available in Nigeria in 
    order to assess the contribution of such consumptions to 
    environmental heavy metals pollution in Nigeria.
MATERIALS AND METHOD
Dry cells of different brands and sizes were purchased from 
    retail outlets in Okigwe, and Umuahia in Southeastern Nigeria. The 
    dry cells were mainly of the Zn/MnO2 system. 
    The brands of dry cells used in this study is shown in Table 1.The 
    dry cells were carefully opened and dried to constant weight for 12 
    hours at 1100C in an oven. The carbon 
    rod and cathode mix (MnO2 + carbon + 
    electrolyte) were ground in a porcelain mortar into a fine particle'black mix'. To obtain a representative 
    sample of the dry cell as is discarded, a weight ratio of 2:3 was 
    used for the metal cover and the black mix respectively. 0.5g of the sample was digested with 2:1 mixture of 
    HNO3/HCIO4. After the 
    initial violent reaction with evolution of brown fumes had subsided 
    (ca. 10min), the digestion flask was covered with a watchglass and 
    digested up to 150°C in a regulated programmable aluminum digestion 
    block. This was then treated with two portions of the 
    HNO3/HCIO4 and 
    evaporated to near dryness. More acid mixture was added and the 
    digestion continued until dense white fumes was evolved, marking 
    the completion of the digestion process. This was then evaporated 
    to near dryness and taken up in 1M HNO3 
    filtered through pre-acid washed Whatman No. 4 filter paper 
    into a 10ml volumetric flask and made up to mark with the 1M 
    HNO3. This was subsequently analyzed for Pb 
    and Cd using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Buck 
    Scientific, Model 210). Internal quality control procedure with 
    re-tests of standards was undertaken. A recovery study of the total 
    analytical procedure was carried out by spiking portions of two 
    previously analyzed brands with varying concentrations of Pb and 
    Cd. These were homogenized, redried and passed through the 
    digestion and analytical steps. Results reported are averages to of 
    duplicates.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Average recoveries of 81 and 91% were obtained for Pb and Cd 
    respectively. These low recoveries may be attributed to the high 
    carbon content of the samples and its high adsorption power. 
    Retention losses are also possible as silica crucibles have been 
    shown to retain an average of 16% Pb (Ajayi et al 2001; Gorsuch, 
    1959). The mean (± SD) Pb and Cd content of the dry cells studied 
    is 1077.9±751.7mg/kg (Range 42 - 3170mg/kg) and 
    108.29±81.41mg/kg (Range 4.6 - 410mg/kg) 
    respectively. Because of the skewed nature of the results obtained, 
    the data was normalized by logarithmic transformation by 
    calculating the geometric mean. A summary of the result obtained 
    according to the sizes of the dry cells is shown in Table 2. The 
    dry cells are grouped according to the type of the outer cover and 
    into'Cd-free cells' and'normal cells' following indications on their labels 
    (Table 3) The mean Pb content of dry 
    cells with non-metal cover (1325.0±857.3mg/kg) is 
    significantly higher (p<0.005 
    )than the corresponding value for the dry cells with metal 
    cover (682.5±307.2mg/kg).Similarly, the mean Cd 
    content of the dry cells with non-metal cover (141.9± 
    82.3mg/kg) is significantly higher (p<0.005) than 
    those of the dry cells with metal cover (54.5±47.9mg/kg),Table 3. This may indicate that dry cells with improved 
    packaging are more environment friendly. In Nigeria dry cells with 
    metal cover are on the average 25% costlier. This improved metal 
    outer packaging reduces leakages even on abusive use of the dry 
    cells.
About a third of the dry cells studied (36%) were imported from 
    China Mainland. The higher mean Pb and Cd contents of these Chinese 
    dry cells compared to cells from other countries ( 
    Tables 4) may be explained by the 
    observation that more than 90% of these cells have non-metal outer 
    cover. The mean Pb and Cd content of the dry cells labeled'Cd-Free' (919.4±660.7mg/kg 
    and 89.6±60.5mg/kg respectively) are lower than the 
    corresponding values for the'normal cells'. This is however not statistically significant. The mean Pb and 
    Cd values of the'Cd-Free' cells with 
    metal cover (724.0±389.9mg/kg and 52.4±63.2mg/kg
respectively) are also lower than the values for the'Cd -free' cells without metal cover (980.7±813.8mg/kg and 133.0±20.0mg/kg respectively). It was 
    observed that three (3)'Cd-free' cells 
    of the same brand (different sizes) have mean Pb and Cd values of 
    743.7mg/kg and 33.7mg/kg respectively. This low mean 
    Cd value appears to indicate a true reduction in the Cd content of 
    this brand. This may indicate the industrial application of the 
    extensive research at reducing/eliminating and finding alternatives 
    to the use of Hg and Cd in dry cells manufacture. The country of 
    origin of this brand of dry cells in however not indicated on the 
    label. A weak, albeit significant, positive correlation was found 
    between the Pb and Cd contents of the dry cells (r = 0.398, 
    p<0.02). This corroborates the result of a study in the 
    vicinity of an automotive battery manufacturing company in Nigeria 
    (Onianwa & Fakayode, 2000). This positive correlation indicates 
    that the estimated regression model of the data obtained, Cd = 
    61.67 + 0.043 (Pb) can explain only about 16% of the 
    variation in the data obtained (R2 = 0.16). This model 
    therefore is insufficient to give accurate predictions. The highest 
    Pb and Cd values (3170mg/kg and 410mg/kg respectively) were 
    obtained in dry cells imported from China (Table 4) The Pb and Cd 
    contents of the only surviving local Nigerian brand are 408mg/kg 
    and 34.5mg/kg. The dry cell from the United States contains 
    303mgPb/kg and 11.1mgCd/kg which are lower than the corresponding 
    values for dry cells from Nigeria, and elsewhere. The Pb and Cd 
    content of the Nigerian brand are also lower than the mean Pb and 
    Cd values for dry cells from China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and 
    Spain (Table 4). About 15 billion batteries are produced in China 
    yearly with about 10 batteries per person per year in China. At 
    present more than 60% of the Nigerian primary battery trade is 
    controlled by China.
In the US, about 2.5 billion household batteries are 
    purchased each year. More than 90% of this is single use batteries 
    that find their way into landfills and incinerators. The US-EPA 
    estimated that in 1989, 88% of the 1.4 million pounds (635 
    metric tonnes) of Hg in urban trash in the US came from single-use 
    batteries (Schwartz et al., 1994).One major concern is that the heavy metals contained by 
    dry cells could leach from landfills into ground water, or shift to 
    fly ash at open waste minimization/burning sites or at 
    waste-to-energy plants (Nakamura, 1996; Malloy, 1994). The 
    management of Ni-Cd rechargeable batteries is a problem that has 
    assumed a global dimension (Rydh and Karlstrom, 2002). In Nigeria, 
    Ni-Cd batteries, auto-rechargeable batteries and primary battery 
    wastes are disposed with municipal waste. Nigeria does not have any 
    integrated framework regarding the monitoring and management of 
    toxic and hazardous materials and wastes. Limited funding has also 
    caused significant impediments to the effective management of toxic 
    and hazardous wastes. Apart from scarcity of financial resources, 
    there has not been any development of appropriate technology 
    following the principles of waste minimization and sustainable 
    development. Any interim effort to halt this form of metal 
    pollution in Nigeria must include the proper financing and 
    management of waste, and the provision of basic infrastructure to 
    halt the open burning of waste in inhabited area. Long term control 
    measures will include legislating and enforcing the removal of dry 
    cells and similar toxic products from wastes to be incinerated and 
    the setting-up of national standards for the levels of heavy metals 
    in dry cells.

NigerianEnglish,may,"Management Choices - Courses to Offer Since it may not be feasible or practicable to start off by offering all academic programmes and courses, there is need to carefully make a choice of those to start with",epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,AHum_04,"Need to Consider a New Approach
In view of the problems being encountered in funding the 
    existing tertiary institutions using the traditional residential 
    campus model, there is need to consider an alternative that is more 
    cost-effective. Based on our study of similar developments in many 
    other countries, a viable option, which can adequately address the 
    problem in a more cost-effective manner, is that of employing the 
    Open and Distance Learning techniques, augmented by a judicious use 
    of new information and communications technologies.
The need for lifelong learning to enable workers to upgrade 
    their skills and maintain competitiveness within rapidly evolving 
    economies is generating a worldwide demand for part-time tertiary 
    education by adults.
In view of the serious constraints and problems being 
    encountered in the operation of conventional tertiary institutions 
    in Nigeria as well as many other countries, it now appears highly 
    unlikely that Nigeria (and many other countries) will be able to 
    expand tertiary enrolments, using conventional face-to-face 
    teaching methods and the current residential campus model that 
    often breeds disturbances in the institutions.
If adequately managed, distance education could facilitate an 
    expansion of tertiary enrolments at less cost per student under the 
    traditional residential campus system. Greater flexibility in the 
    design and delivery of curriculum content than is normally 
    associated with classroom teaching enables distance education 
    courses to adapt to specific students' needs or work 
    requirements, thereby enabling greater relevance.
It can effectively reach those learners who, for various 
    reasons, have been denied access to tertiary education. Being the 
    most modern form of educational delivery, distance education is 
    innovating rapidly and expanding globally as well as employing 
    worldwide-accumulated experience that has been contributing to more 
    effective programme design.
These benefits have made tertiary distance education the 
    world's fastest growing educational sector in most countries. 
    Here in Nigeria and sub-Saharan African countries, we are yet to 
    catch up in the development and effective use of this versatile 
    education mode, mainly because of the poor state of infrastructural 
    and technological development in these countries as well as 
    inadequate government support, particularly in Nigeria.
Efforts being made to Solve Problems via Distance 
    Education
There have been some encouraging efforts made by the Government 
    to develop Open and Distance Education in Nigeria since the 
    National Workshop on this in September 2000 that articulated a 
    pragmatic vision of distance education and its potential 
    contributions and role in tackling the country's educational 
    problems. Another Workshop on Developing Materials for Open 
    Distance Education later followed in 2001 at Abuja from 4 to 8 
    June, aimed at training people to develop the skills of producing 
    good quality-text-based-audio, video and CD-ROM-based distance 
    learning materials. Other Workshops and Meetings have been held on 
    the Virtual Library Project and preparation of necessary drafts of 
    legal instrument and blueprints on various aspects needed for the 
    effective take-off of the National Open and Distance Learning 
    Project in a no distant date.
Having made significant efforts to put in place required 
    machinery and resources to implement the various recommendations 
    and proposals to institutionalise virile National Open and Distance 
    Learning Programmes in the Country, this submission being made is 
    essentially in form of offering suggestions to assist the effective 
    take-off of the Programmes.
The suggestions being made are based mainly on some lessons from 
    our past experience with operation of distance learning in Nigeria 
    and some useful aspects of its operation in some other 
    countries.
Suggestions for Effective implementation of the National 
    Open and Distance Learning Project
Structural Framework for Implementing the National Open 
    and Distance Learning Programme
For effective implementation of the National Open and Distance 
    Learning programme all over the country, there should be a 
    well-coordinated decentralised structural framework composed of 
    about three main Regional Zones - Northern, South-Western and 
    South-Eastern zones with Regional Headquarters at Kaduna, Ibadan 
    and Enugu respectively. Instead of three Regional Zones, the six 
    Geographical Zones may be considered.
The National Headquarters at Abuja, headed by a National 
    Coordinator will coordinate all the activities, formulate policies 
    and put them into effective operation through the Regional Zones 
    and States, recruit and train needed personnel, produce course 
    texts and other learning materials and facilities for use in 
    running the programmes.
The Regional Zones, headed by Zonal Programme Coordinators and 
    the States headed by State Programme Coordinator will implement the 
    programmes being put in place at the National Headquarters, first 
    through the Zonal Coordinator and then the State Coordinator.
Technology
The choice of appropriate technology to be used must be able to 
    accommodate such limitations as lack of access to telephones, 
    electricity, etc., by most of the target population. Also, 
    technological resources should be affordable and cost effective for 
    students.
The technology to employ for the delivery of the distance 
    education programmes has to be of hybrid or multiple media type. 
    This will combine the use of print media, audio-visual learning 
    aids, employing recorded radio cassettes and T.V. 
    video plus broadcasting of lectures through the existing Radio and 
    T. V. media as well as through the beaming of 
    lectures by satellite, and to be finally supplemented with 
    electronically applied learning devices, E-mail, Internet and other 
    computer applications now being designed for use in running the 
    programme.
Progress in the use of any of the multiple media delivery modes 
    will be dictated to a large extent by the provision of electricity 
    and other infrastructural facilities to make them possible for 
    application to reach the target students all over the country. 
    Experience has shown that how the media are used has proven to be 
    more important than which medium is selected.
Also, our local experience here has shown that whatever 
    technology is employed should consider the usefulness of 
    interactivity between students and tutors which contributes a major 
    boost to learning.
The Role of Tutorial Support
Judging form our local situation and the fact that one of the 
    chief disadvantages often cited by companies was the lack of human 
    interaction inherent in a typical distance education system, the 
    employment of some form of tutorial support is worth 
    considering.
This can now employ the use of satellite technology with VSAT 
    for the delivery of instructional materials to students at their 
    respective Study Resource Centres. At our Distance Learning 
    institute (DLI) at Unilag, we in fact, employ this by face-to-face 
    tutorial and teaching periodically and during the residential 
    period of about four weeks per session when the students interact 
    with tutors and take their examinations.
While assessing current good practice from other countries, it 
    is desirable to develop explicit national strategies for tertiary 
    distance education and associated technology development that are 
    solidly based upon local capacities, which in some cases are 
    significant.
Management Choices - Courses to Offer
Since it may not be feasible or practicable to start off by 
    offering all academic programmes and courses, there is need to 
    carefully make a choice of those to start with. Judging from our 
    own experience, it is usually best to start with a smaller number 
    and high quality distance education courses that respond to 
    significant areas of public demand which may be identified by a 
    market survey. Also, careful consideration should be given in 
    choosing courses to the country's employment needs and related 
    job skills.
Administrative Flexibility
There is need for greater administrative flexibility than the 
    usual rigid system in the traditional face-to-face education 
    system. Such greater flexibility is not only desirable but also 
    quite necessary in making tertiary institutions respond to the 
    changing demands of the educational system.
Policies for Capacity-Building
Staff training to make them acquire required skill to mount 
    effective distance education programmes should be given the desired 
    attention. This is in realisation of the importance of capacities 
    for planning and for management in distance learning than in the 
    conventional face-to-face education, mainly because communications 
    with distant learners could be more expensive and time-consuming 
    than those being addressed together in the classroom.
The employment of partnerships is considered useful for 
    capacity-building in distance education, most especially in the 
    areas of collaboration that include:
(a) The sharing of instructional materials;
(b) Development of new courses;
(c) Training of teachers and managers;
(d) Programme evaluation;
(e) Experimentation in the use of technology;
(f) Sharing of experience on common policy issues;
(g) Widening of access for individual learners through credit 
    interchange;
(h) Mutual recognition of credit.
By mutually agreeing to work together, institutions can pool 
    limited resources to provide facilities to be jointly utilised, 
    e.g. Satellite broadcasting services. This brings 
    about economies of scale that will enable activities like the 
    satellite technology with VSATto be undertaken collectively that 
    could not be done individually.
Team Approach to Development of Production of Courses for 
    Distance Education
Teams are useful in developing distance education courses 
    because of the various specialisations that are needed. The team is 
    usually composed of the following experts.
(a) Course Content Specialists: Prepare the 
    basis for the study guide and write the course text modules. A 
    course text, usually consisting of about fifteen modules may be 
    written by a specialist in that Course or preferably by two or more 
    specialists who would each write some of the modules, say five 
    modules each written by three specialists to make the total fifteen 
    modules.
(b) Review Editor and Communications 
    Specialist: They will review the written draft.
(c) Graphic Artist/Designer: To further 
    develop the revised text.
(d) Pedagogical Specialist, Librarian or Information 
    Specialist: To further develop or improve on the revised 
    text.
(e) Specialist in Desktop Publishing: To 
    produce the course text materials.
(f) Overall Course Text Team Leader: 
    Coordinates the course text preparation and manages the production 
    schedule.
Workshop for Course Text Team
Before starting the course text writing, it is useful to 
    organise a workshop, to bring together all the specialists for 
    necessary briefing on what to do and the format the course text 
    should take.
For such training workshop, a good training programme for 
    distance education instructors will include:
1. Practice in the design, production, and presentation of 
    learning materials;
2. Ample hands-on-practice with delivery technologies;
3. Practice with techniques in how to humanise a course; and
4. Practice with techniques for facilitating students' 
    participation.
Generally, the production of distance learning materials can be 
    a costly activity, and is therefore the area in which good 
    management can do the most to reduce programme costs. One useful 
    strategy to consider at the initial take-offstage is the purchase 
    of some existing course materials from any of the existing 
    reputable distance education institutions with learning materials 
    that are proven and readily available. Some of the recently 
    established distance education institutions in Nigeria as well as 
    the Open University of Tanzania obtained our written course texts 
    at DLI, Unilag for use when they started.

NigerianEnglish,may,These harmful cells may spread locally to adjacent tissues or to other locations in the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,PNsc_14,"Cervical Cancer, The Silent Killer
Cancer is an umbrella term for more than 100 life-threatening 
    diseases characterized by the uncontrolled, abnormal growth of 
    malignant cells. These harmful cells may spread locally to adjacent 
    tissues or to other locations in the body through the bloodstream 
    or lymphatic system. Cancer may affect people at all ages, but the 
    risk for most varieties increases with age. Cancer causes about 13% 
    of all deaths. According to the American Cancer Society, 7.6 
    million people died from cancer in the world during 2007.
Cervical cancer has been proven to be due to a virus called the 
    Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Global prevalence of HPV in cervical 
    carcinoma is 99.7%. Over 100 types of HPV have been 
    discovered with at least 13 genotypes associated with cancer. The 
    eight most common high-risk genotypes (HPV 16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52, 
    58 and 35) account for 90% of cases of cervical cancer. Apart from 
    HPV 16 and 18, each individual genotype causes a small (5%) 
    proportion of cases. HPV 16 and 18 account for more than 70% of all 
    cervical cancers in the world. HPV 31 and 45 are implicated in 
    about 4% of the cases. The low risk HPV genotypes can cause genital 
    warts or low-grade lesions on the cervical surface. Between 90% and 
    100% of genital warts are caused by HPV genotypes 6 and 11.
Worldwide, cervical cancer is a major cause of cancer related 
    morbidity and mortality in women. It continues to be the second 
    commonest female cancer worldwide after breast carcinoma. The 
    prevalence of genital HPV infection in the world is around 440 
    million. It is estimated that there were almost 260 000 deaths from 
    cervical cancer in 2005, and 2.7 million years of life lost. 
    About 500 000 cases of cervical cancer are estimated to occur each 
    year and over 80% of which occur in developing countries, where 
    neither population-based routine screening nor optimal treatment is 
    available. The highest estimated incidence rates of cervical cancer 
    occur in Africa, Central and South America and Asia. In Nigeria, 
    very few women are screened for cervical cancer, in fact, it is 
    estimated that only 10% of female physicians in Nigeria have ever 
    had a Pap smear themselves. In another study conducted in a 
    tertiary institution in Nigeria, seventy-one percent were aware of 
    cervical cancer, while only 33 percent were aware of 
    Papanicolaou's smear. It is estimated that without a 
    significant improvement in prevention, there will be a million new 
    cases of HPV by the year 2049.
Predisposing factors to HPV infection include sexual activity, 
    prior Sexually Transmitted Infections, early sexual debut, 
    prolonged use of birth control pills, women who smoke, and having 
    same sex or multiple sexual partners. Genital HPV infection is 
    extremely common and most often causes no symptoms. HPV is 
    transmitted through sexual intercourse, however transmission can 
    occur without penetrative sex, as HPV is transmitted through 
    skin-to-skin contact in the genital area. Therefore, every sexually 
    active woman is at risk. 50-80% of women will acquire an HPV 
    infection in their lifetime and up to 50% of those infections will 
    be oncogenic HPV type. Progressions from HPV infection to Cervical 
    Cancer is slow and usually take years. Hence, the infection is 
    usually more prevalent among women from ages 35-50.
Cervical cancer is preventable, and treatable if detected early. 
    Vaccination with HPV vaccine is credited with reducing both the 
    incidence and death rate from cervical cancer. Gardasil, a 
    prophylactic quadrivalent vaccine manufactured by Merck& 
    Co. and licensed in many countries is designed to protect 
    against HPV 16 and 18 and also protects against low-risk genotypes 
    6 and 11. Administration of three (3) doses at intervals of 2 
    months between doses 1 and 2; 6 months between doses 1 and 3 in 
    females and males between ages 9–15 years with Merck’s HPV vaccine 
    will reduce the incidence of low-grade and high-grade lesions, 
    infection with vaccine HPV types, long-term duration of protection 
    and robust anti-HPV responses when administered with other common 
    vaccines. Thereby, reducing the physical, emotional, and financial 
    burden of management of HPV disease. GSK’s Cervarix is a bivalent 
    vaccine with only HPV 16 and 18.
Secondary prevention is done through screening and treatment of 
    identified pre-cancerous lesions. Screening methods includes Pap 
    Smear, Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid, Visual Inspection with 
    Lugol’s Iodine, HPV DNA Testing, Hybrid Capture® 2 Test (HC-2) and 
    The Fast HPV test. Pap smear screening in developed countries have 
    contributed to an 80% reduction of the incidence of cervical 
    cancer. Hysterectomy, Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy are mostly used 
    as tertiary intervention.
According to World Health Organization, preliminary data show 
    that HPV vaccination may be cost-effective in developing countries. 
    Currently, in Uganda, Programme for Appropriate Technology in 
    Health (PATH) in close collaboration with the local Ministry of 
    Health and other partners are piloting HPV vaccine introduction. 
    The piloting has also been carried out in India, Vietnam and Peru. 
    The governments of developing countries including Nigeria need 
    cancer policies and step up media enlightenment in the fight 
    against cervical cancer which is not only health concerns but 
    social, economic, and psychological burdens. Operation Stop 
    Cervical Cancer Nigeria (SCCAN) and other relevant organizations 
    should join hands in preventing cervical cancer in Nigerian 
    women.

NigerianEnglish,may,"So, if we fathers learn to work on ourselves, we can effectively reach our children even though at present, they may not like some of the instructions and reprimands we give them (just as in the days of our parents when we felt that they were too harsh on us)",epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,SkHo_16,"How to be a good dad to your children
COMMENTS by some children about their father are disheartening. 
    You will hear them talk about the head of the home as someone who 
    hasn’t been there for them. A father who is never around; a good 
    man to everyone but his own. To some children, daddy is the 
    greatest. He buys whatever they ask for, and pampers them with 
    gifts. He saves them from mummy’s spanking. That daddy will always 
    be on my side is the confidence some children have.
I counseled a lady recently who was concerned about her 
    children’s behaviour. They seem to be going wild by the day, and 
    she’s loosing control over them; thanks to their dad. She said he 
    would not allow her discipline them. If she did that when he was 
    not at home, the children would report her to him when she came 
    back home and all hell would be let loose. She had tried to talk 
    him into seeing the negative effect of his actions to no avail. So, 
    to the children, dad is the greatest while mummy is a bully.
There is a need to redefine the word ‘good’ if we will be effective 
    fathers. The word ‘good’ isn’t synonymous to 
    letting your children have their way. It’s not when your children 
    call you good that you are one, but when deep in your heart, you 
    know that you have trained them to be better people for their own 
    sake and to live a purposeful life. Being a good dad is not about 
    what you do but who you are. So, if we fathers learn to work on 
    ourselves, we can effectively reach our children even though at 
    present, they may not like some of the instructions and reprimands 
    we give them (just as in the days of our parents when we felt that 
    they were too harsh on us).
To be a good dad, we must learn to control our emotions, one of 
    which is anger. Our children will sometimes provoke us, but 
    throwing a feat or a punch at our children won’t help them grow up 
    as emotionally stable individuals. Screaming at them isn’t an 
    effective medium of communication either. Have you observed that 
    when you tell your children to do things out of anger, they often 
    turn up not doing it well. Their minds seem to shut down when they 
    are screamed at. The old time religion of being smacked for every 
    wrong done is also not too effective when it’s done out of anger 
    instead of love. One other emotion that must be put in check is 
    love that doesn’t give room for correction. You should never love 
    your children to the point they would become no good; you should 
    give room for them to be corrected.
To be a good dad, we must let their mum have her way. In the 
    days of our fathers, it was common to find daddies reprimanding 
    mummies in the presence of the children. Sometimes, it’s because 
    mummy ‘over-reacted’ in the way she 
    acted to them when they did wrong. In such a family where this is 
    common, you will always find the pampered children eventually 
    becoming a nuisance to the parents (both daddy and mummy).
I am of the opinion that when it comes to raising our children, 
    we must learn to respect their mothers’ opinions. I heard my wife 
    say to my son once, ‘don’t touch that juice yet, it’s too early to 
    put it in your belly’. A few minutes later, he walked to the bed 
    with his lovely eyes begging for daddy to over turn mummy’s word. I 
    was tempted, but I said NO. If you feel that their mum is too hard 
    on them, then call her later when the children are not there to 
    express your feeling.
If we will be good fathers, we must learn to express ourselves 
    to our children not just by actions but by affirmative words. Many 
    of our fathers are old skool. 
    Many daddies would never say to their children I am proud of you or 
    I love you or sorry, etc. I appreciate what Gerald Anthony wrote on 
    the topic, ‘How to be a good father’, 
    when he said: ""It’s a sort of a cliché that fathers are 
    proud of their children... but a lot of fathers don’t realize how 
    important it is to actually tell their kids, not just their friends 
    and co-workers! Your kids need to know that you’re proud of them 
    for ... and the things that they do that you show them you’re proud 
    of are the things they will try to do again. If you show them that 
    you are proud of their good grades, they will try to get good 
    grades ... if you show them that you are proud of them being a good 
    person, or good with their siblings, or something else, they will 
    do whatever it is that made you proud again (or at least 
    try).""
To be a good dad, we must value self-improvement. When I speak 
    in relationship meetings, I categorically say that mega few men 
    read books on relationship. When you see men with books, over 80 
    per cent of the time, it’s a book on finance - how to make more 
    money. I believe that the worst way to learn a thing is through 
    experience. Truly, we don’t know things by default, we are created 
    to learn to know. There is a need for every dad to pick a book on 
    how to properly raise their children, read it and act on the 
    instructions given.

Nwa-Nna,
Was a warm chat with exciting recalls and 
    memiors of the fellowship we 
    shared. God bless you and we keep on our kneels for your 
    wife's health and the success of the '
     touch-down'. 
    We'll give Him no rest until our winning goal hits the 
    net.Ndewoo! same old 
    .

You sound pious and at the same time I read bitter 
    vernoms. You wish me well and at 
    the same time I see concluding phrases to years of relationship. It 
    should not be so. When and how did all these start? I am not a 
    saint neither are you. But we must make certain that the devil is 
    armbushed to devour, to put a 
    knife on the string that holds brethren together. You should be 
    able to tell who  is by now. 
    Wealth, material things are but 
    ephumeral and fleeting. Riches have wimgs. And they can fly. As I said earlier, I trusted you 
    and committed a few things under your care. I 
    dont regret it. I will not. 
    It is not common with me to undo my conviction about someone I am 
    committed to. Yes committed to. When this bond turns to gratifying 
    a selfish interest, there trouble looms. 
    , I was pissed off when you could 
    not consider my dad's plight, when 'it was 
    not convinient for 
    you' to the dismay of my dad. (I have returned 
    that cheque given for the hire of the van because the van was not 
    delivered before the young man travelled East-ward). That should 
    tell you how hard it has been to cope financially with my school, 
    my family, my dad's upkeep, and my 
    sibblings. Second, without recourse to our 
    aggreement to put the van into 
    transport business, the use was diverted without a clear consent. I 
    sent it in your name but it still belonged to me. Assuming my dad 
    was not involved, maybe nobody would have heard us. That old man is 
    my pride, he deserves all the support I can provide. Thirdly, I 
    think you needed to be more open and expressive in your spending. 
    No updates, to mention of or detailing of the list of expenses. I 
    was not told, so I continued to plan on the initial bulk sale price 
    of the land (such plans as 'open account with 
    it', 'give your wife 50,000 
    naira for your car fix', 'pay 
    the clearing agent whatever you have' etc). 
    These are but the cracks. I still believe in times of pressure we 
    should observe to carefully yield to the inner voice of conscience 
    and obey the spirit of grace. I know you have much to chew with 
    putting things together for the family. Even at crossroads, 
    blisters and bitterness should not pervade the path of godliness. I 
    feel the pain as much as you do. But it is not yet over. You 
    dont have to say all the good 
    you have done for me, it is also unwholesome for me to give a 
    laundary list of mine. If we did 
    business together, I did not know the details. All I know is that 
    we traded TRUST, of which my financial stream powered the process. 
    I am willing to give you ALL the profit, if any, from all the 
    deliveries you undertook on my behalf. (I mean what I say without 
    any bitterness). I dare say, hold unto the 250,000 naira you said 
    is left of the 850,000 from the land sale. Charge whatever is 
    outstanding to my account, by the grace of God, I will pay when I 
    visit again. Again, I am not bitter; NO, not me. The 6 months you 
    used the Dodge should be charged to my account, its a goodwill to 
    you. And whatever we did agree that you use from the house you 
    should stay as we discussed.  it is 
    'an off tangent' to let the 
    devil smile at us after more than 30 years. Keep and own the 
    company-  papers. It is yours from 
    henceforth. I sent some books through 
     for your kids as we discussed. 
    Please accept them from him. I apologize for telling brethren the 
    issue that started all these. Again I did that knowing that we are 
    of same household, the inner caucus; Never intended it to be a tale 
    told by certain 'strangers'.
I will wait for the storm to settle, for I intend to find His 
    path and instruction and leadership therein. Do your best not to 
    end it like this. You were hurt, I was hurt; but we can only lead 
    the sheep by showing maturing and 
    examplifying with our lessons and take-homes from this 
    rancour.
God bless you and please kiss your wife for me.
 
    
Bro ,
As per this matter. it remains a 
    cord and a deadly blow to me. I 
    dont know what to say. Presently, I owe the clearing agent 
    500,000 naira for the 2nd container; I owe more than $20,000 on 
    credit due to the shipments; I owe total commitment to the course 
    of the Lord in the church and elsewhere; I owe my family 
    sustainance courtesy of the 
    expected job being applied for. I dont think these calculations 
    will help me. If my brother feels anything with respect to money 
    committed to his care, it is worthwhile to go pay the clearing 
    agent who has my wares under seizure. If he feels bitter for ALL HE 
    HAS DONE FOR ME FOR WHICH I HAVE NOT PAID, let it be and by the 
    grace of God, I will pay for those (if only I can be made to 
    understand what I am owing). I want to thank you for the great 
    concern and prayers. I write in pains; trusting God to help me. 
    Tell  that I 
    dont regret our relationship; 
    that I love him as ever and I appreciate our friendship even in 
    these confusion and dissections. God bless you, brother.
as always,
 
    
Beloved,
Kaanu!
For the meantime, please see the attached for your necessary 
    comments.
We will win the crown, no matter how the enemy schemes.
Udo diri unu,

,
I owe you appologies for 
    this mess. I believe the faith we share is worth more than gold. My 
    heart bleeds with these woes. I never intended it to be so. But I 
    could not but call  
    , 
    and 
    Sis.  
     to let out my burden. I did not 
    call you because it is never to be heard; a detestable development. 
    Trust me, I tried my best to get  to 
    open up and do the right thing. I have been hurt thrice by my 
    beloved  in business circles. This 
    time, my father is involved, credit card money is involved and the 
    issue of accountability and trust is fast eroded. The devil struck 
    a cord the past 6 or 7 months with a worldly possession. What a 
    shame! But it is now a known fact that 
     thinks I owe him a fortune. I 
    dont think so. Or he may be 
    right as my brother in Christ. Whatever it is, I 
    dont have that money I used 
    to have before; so the expectation is misplaced. I just want people 
    to wait until the harvest. I trusted 
     . That is why I gave him my money to hold, gave him the 2 vans I 
    sent (Sienna and Dodge) to sell and maybe I do not have any other 
    fellow to entrust my stuff with. I sold land (with him) and never 
    asked him to show me the physical cash; trusted him to use it to 
    open an account with it.(This he 
    alledges I was unstable in the 
    use) Along the line, money was needed to 
    clear the second container. And he came up with expenses that he 
    had done before. He cant 
    account for 850,000 correctly. Maybe he did not misuse the money. 
    But I have the right to know and ask for what belongs to me. 
    Assuming a certain need took part of that, he could have explained 
    upfront. (Afterall I forgave 
    more than 100,000 naira worth of goods from Cotonou in 1999). The 
    Dodge was for sale. He said it 
    couldnt sell. Upted for transport and I asked if he could 
    manage it. He said yes. I left Nigeria, and he diverted it to his 
    Daycare use without any recourse to our plans. I never knew about 
    this. All these while, my dad had been waiting. Nothing. I called 
    and asked him to please release the van; he wanted to buy it. 
    Offered 500,000 naira. The cost is $4,800 plus 250,000 naira 
    clearing. I refused to sell for his bid. Asked if he can pay the 
    cost instalmentally.  said no. About 
    2 weeks ago,  
     's brother wanted to hire 
    tha van for a week. 
     already paid for this. I asked 
     to release the van. He argues that 
    it is not at his 
    convinience.  judge 
    ' 's 
    convinience and my 
    father's loss.
Now here is the account:
Toyota Sienna sold for (according to 
    ) 1,150,000 naira. Plus 
     land land sold for 850,000 = 
    2,000,000 naira
Clearing cost for Dodge and Sienna= 500,000 naira
Changed to $2,500 = 420,000 naira
's expense in Nigeria = 
    350,000
Disbursed to my Dad = 170,000
 
    purchaesd row seats for Dodge= 35,000
Hotel Accomodation in 
    Lagos =30,000
Total 1,505,000 Bal. 495,000 naira (
     I asked him to give the clearing 
    agent this money)
, this is my very first attempt 
    to calculate this money. I trusted , 
    I gave him a free hand. I never doubted his fidelity. But the 
    problem is that he would not open up to let me know what he wants 
    out of our relationship. I borrowed to buy and send the van, to buy 
    the computers, I have been in school for these 2 and half years. 
    Never earned an income. My wife works to sustain the home. And 
     prizes his business more than my 
    father's daily feeding. Rebuke me where I err. Is it a bad 
    thing to put the van into something that will yield some cash for 
    my dad?
Let me hear from you my brother.
Thanks for your concern.
 
    
, release my Dodge van to Mr.   
    today 5/20/09. You should also provide the 850,00 naira from the 
    sale of my  land. Give it to 
      my 
    causine. Kindly send the 
    computers to my causine as well. 
    My properties in your flat should also be sent there, I will be 
    willing to provide labour and transport for conveyance, please. 
    Just to let you know that I have nothing against you if you can do 
    these. Remember the scriptures: What shall it profit a man, 
    if he gains the whole world and suffers the loss of his soul, or 
    what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Your 
    account is cooked up, we never agreed to use the van 
    van for your private use (you call 
    it 'efficient use') to the 
    detriment of my father in whose name the van was sent. Very 
    unfortunate! Release my van today, turn in the other stuff and the 
    money and we'll be fine. Remember we are all brethren
    ,( I suppose we are).
God bless you.

Two dubious public expenditure items from Bayelsa and Enugu 
    States were buried inside a few newspapers last week, causing 
    hardly a whimper among scandal-fatigued Nigerians, but reinforcing 
    the general perception that venality in public office has worsened 
    in recent years.
The first was the revelation that the 16 standing committees set 
    up by the Bayelsa State Government to organize a reception for 
    Umaru Musa Yar’Adua had submitted a bill of N1.2 billion out 
    of which N456 million had been shared out before Abuja abruptly 
    announced the postponement of the two-day presidential visit for 
    reasons still unclear.
The other curious bill was the N600 million burial expenses 
    submitted to the Enugu State Government by the committee planning a 
    state burial for Chief Christian Chukwuma Onoh, Governor (for three 
    months only) of old Anambra State.
Media reports last week quoted officials of the Bayelsa State 
    Government appealing to the committee members not to divert the 
    N456 million elsewhere since there was still hope that the visit 
    could be rescheduled soon. The governor’s security adviser, Chief 
    Pereneme Kpodoh, even wrote a rambling, sycophantic open letter to 
    Yar’Adua pleading for a rescheduling of the visit and blaming 
    Governor Timipre Sylva’s political opponents for aborting a visit 
    which he said would have brought ""positive changes"" to 
    the ""developmental landscape"" of the state. The 
    advertorial which ran in most national newspapers last week did not 
    say what positive changes a two-day presidential visit would have 
    wrought on Bayelsa’s developmental landscape that could warrant or 
    justify spending N1.2 billion on Yar’Adua’s reception.
Enugu and the other states that constituted the old Anambra are 
    yet to make public how much of the N600-million pricy burial 
    expenses they made available to the planning committee. But judging 
    from the vituperations and angry denunciations of the Enugu State 
    government last week by Onoh’s son, Joseph, it was clear that the 
    ever reticent and focused Governor Sullivan Chime did not play 
    ball. He must have been highly scandalized by the huge funeral 
    budget submitted by the planning committee and might have resolved 
    to throw it back at the committee, perhaps with an advice that they 
    could very well auction a part of Onoh’s vast estate to raise the 
    ridiculous funeral fee.
""Despite all the disappointment by the Enugu 
    government"", Joseph Onoh told newsmen last week on the eve of 
    the burial of his father, a wealthy lawyer and politician who was 
    said to have owned over 100 houses in Enugu alone during his 
    lifetime. ""We are ready to bury our father"". He accused 
    Enugu State government of frustrating ""our burial plans"" 
    and commended the ""high level of commitment shown by other 
    governors of the South-East"" – a hint that those other 
    governors must have been blackmailed to contributed a chunk of the 
    hefty burial sum.
The irony was lost on Joseph and members of the burial committee 
    that Onoh, a self-made man who was well known for his disciplined 
    and frugal lifestyle, would have fought against the very idea of 
    wasting N600 million scarce public funds on his burial. Had such a 
    budget been drawn up before his death, those who knew him swore 
    that he would have gone to court to stop the state government from 
    indulging in such a monumental waste. He would have seen through 
    the gluttonous proclivity of the committee members to pad up the 
    burial budget as part of the usual mercantile schemes to make some 
    quick money from every government-sponsored public event. Onoh 
    would have argued that the money be invested in building more 
    classrooms or in buying books for schools or in stocking hospitals 
    with drugs or in constructing a few rural roads or in drilling over 
    600 boreholes. As a shrewd businessman, he knew that these 
    investments would bring more tangible benefits to the people of the 
    South-East than a N600 million funeral revelry.
Cleverly, both the burial and presidential visit planning 
    committees did not provide a breakdown of how they arrived at these 
    bizarre figures. It is left to a bewildered populace to speculate 
    whether the committees had decided to put Onoh to sleep in an all 
    diamond coffin and make Yar’Adua pass the night in a diamond 
    bedecked bed in Yenagoa village and treat him to a feast of oysters 
    and lobsters. How did it all add up?
These two highly inflated budgets have once again shown our 
    absolute lack of regard for public money. We tend to see public 
    money as belonging to no one in particular and, therefore, have no 
    qualms squandering it on worthless causes. At every available 
    opportunity, we are often too eager to 
    device all sort of schemes to line up our pockets. It is 
    done with impunity. There is no sense of guilt or shame or 
    moderation. And it is getting worse by the day. It used to be in 
    hundreds and thousands of Naira. Today, it is in millions and 
    billions. Kleptomaniacs are getting more audacious. Because they 
    know that there are often no questions asked, let alone sanctions 
    imposed. Life has become one mad rush for material wealth, a 
    primitive acquisition of money, houses, cars, and wives and 
    mistresses.
It is in this context that we must situate the decision of the 
    Bayelsa committees to vote N1.2 billion for the hosting of 
    Yar’Adua and for the burial committee in Enugu to demand N600 
    million for the burial of Onoh. People generally see these two 
    events as a chance to partake in the sharing of the commonwealth 
    since public office holders and their cronies are also believed to 
    be helping themselves to such common resources.
One of the lessons we must draw from these scandals is the 
    abysmal failure of governance or the embarrassing poor quality of 
    leadership in the country. Why would any serious government allow 
    N1.2 billion (about N2.5 million per hour for the two 
    days Yar’Adua would have spent in the state) to be wasted in 
    hosting a leader who has not done anything in the last two years to 
    improve the lives of the people of the Niger Delta? What then is 
    the basis for all the hoopla and excitement about the visit? Would 
    these people spend their personal money with such recklessness? 
    Besides creating the Niger Delta Ministry, what has Yar’Adua to 
    show the people of the region as his achievements in the past two 
    years? Rather than make them richer with his presence, Yar’Adua has 
    made them poorer even by his absence (N456 million has gone with 
    the wind of Yenagoa).
The people of the Niger Delta must learn to hold their leaders 
    accountable for the use of their money. They must have the courage 
    to ask why hosting Yar’Adua for two days should cost them N1.2 billion. In the same vein, the people of the South-East must 
    ask their governors how much they actually coughed out for the 
    burial of Chief C. C. Onoh. They should demand to 
    know whether these governors allowed their states to be robbed in 
    broad daylight in the name of a needless state burial.

NigerianEnglish,must,""" To be a good dad, we must value self-improvement",deontic,deontic,deontic,SkHo_16,"How to be a good dad to your children
COMMENTS by some children about their father are disheartening. 
    You will hear them talk about the head of the home as someone who 
    hasn’t been there for them. A father who is never around; a good 
    man to everyone but his own. To some children, daddy is the 
    greatest. He buys whatever they ask for, and pampers them with 
    gifts. He saves them from mummy’s spanking. That daddy will always 
    be on my side is the confidence some children have.
I counseled a lady recently who was concerned about her 
    children’s behaviour. They seem to be going wild by the day, and 
    she’s loosing control over them; thanks to their dad. She said he 
    would not allow her discipline them. If she did that when he was 
    not at home, the children would report her to him when she came 
    back home and all hell would be let loose. She had tried to talk 
    him into seeing the negative effect of his actions to no avail. So, 
    to the children, dad is the greatest while mummy is a bully.
There is a need to redefine the word ‘good’ if we will be effective 
    fathers. The word ‘good’ isn’t synonymous to 
    letting your children have their way. It’s not when your children 
    call you good that you are one, but when deep in your heart, you 
    know that you have trained them to be better people for their own 
    sake and to live a purposeful life. Being a good dad is not about 
    what you do but who you are. So, if we fathers learn to work on 
    ourselves, we can effectively reach our children even though at 
    present, they may not like some of the instructions and reprimands 
    we give them (just as in the days of our parents when we felt that 
    they were too harsh on us).
To be a good dad, we must learn to control our emotions, one of 
    which is anger. Our children will sometimes provoke us, but 
    throwing a feat or a punch at our children won’t help them grow up 
    as emotionally stable individuals. Screaming at them isn’t an 
    effective medium of communication either. Have you observed that 
    when you tell your children to do things out of anger, they often 
    turn up not doing it well. Their minds seem to shut down when they 
    are screamed at. The old time religion of being smacked for every 
    wrong done is also not too effective when it’s done out of anger 
    instead of love. One other emotion that must be put in check is 
    love that doesn’t give room for correction. You should never love 
    your children to the point they would become no good; you should 
    give room for them to be corrected.
To be a good dad, we must let their mum have her way. In the 
    days of our fathers, it was common to find daddies reprimanding 
    mummies in the presence of the children. Sometimes, it’s because 
    mummy ‘over-reacted’ in the way she 
    acted to them when they did wrong. In such a family where this is 
    common, you will always find the pampered children eventually 
    becoming a nuisance to the parents (both daddy and mummy).
I am of the opinion that when it comes to raising our children, 
    we must learn to respect their mothers’ opinions. I heard my wife 
    say to my son once, ‘don’t touch that juice yet, it’s too early to 
    put it in your belly’. A few minutes later, he walked to the bed 
    with his lovely eyes begging for daddy to over turn mummy’s word. I 
    was tempted, but I said NO. If you feel that their mum is too hard 
    on them, then call her later when the children are not there to 
    express your feeling.
If we will be good fathers, we must learn to express ourselves 
    to our children not just by actions but by affirmative words. Many 
    of our fathers are old skool. 
    Many daddies would never say to their children I am proud of you or 
    I love you or sorry, etc. I appreciate what Gerald Anthony wrote on 
    the topic, ‘How to be a good father’, 
    when he said: ""It’s a sort of a cliché that fathers are 
    proud of their children... but a lot of fathers don’t realize how 
    important it is to actually tell their kids, not just their friends 
    and co-workers! Your kids need to know that you’re proud of them 
    for ... and the things that they do that you show them you’re proud 
    of are the things they will try to do again. If you show them that 
    you are proud of their good grades, they will try to get good 
    grades ... if you show them that you are proud of them being a good 
    person, or good with their siblings, or something else, they will 
    do whatever it is that made you proud again (or at least 
    try).""
To be a good dad, we must value self-improvement. When I speak 
    in relationship meetings, I categorically say that mega few men 
    read books on relationship. When you see men with books, over 80 
    per cent of the time, it’s a book on finance - how to make more 
    money. I believe that the worst way to learn a thing is through 
    experience. Truly, we don’t know things by default, we are created 
    to learn to know. There is a need for every dad to pick a book on 
    how to properly raise their children, read it and act on the 
    instructions given.

NigerianEnglish,must,"She stressed that though a woman needs to work to support the income of the husband especially at this period, but in all of that, she must not lose focus of her primary assignment as a parent",deontic,deontic,deontic,PSsc_09,"Whatever Happened to Traditional Family 
    Structure!
The need to restore the African traditional family 
    structure to allow it regain its traditional status and power of 
    effecting positive change in the society was part of discussion at 
    a recent family congress held in Abuja, writes 
    Mary 
    Ekah
“The task of raising a child properly was a sacred one because 
    of its far reaching consequences for the security and survival of 
    the soul of the community. Fathers, mothers, grandparents, older 
    siblings, in-laws and relatives had a collective responsibility to 
    raise the young and each saw this as an obligation to the family 
    and the larger community. To fail to raise a morally responsible 
    person was to have failed the community and brought disgrace on 
    one’s family and kindred …”
This was the submission of the National Co-coordinator, Marriage 
    and Family Life Committee of the Catholic Bishops Conference and 
    Director of the Lagos Resource Centre, Mrs. Bridget Itsueli 
    at the World Congress Families held in Abuja recently. This was 
    said in recognition of the contribution of the African traditional 
    family to the development of good citizens and establishment of the 
    community’s identity, its outlook, values and goals.
The traditional societies, Itsueli said, recognises the 
    political and social significance of the family, noting however 
    that the modern Nigeria society seems quite ignorant of this truth. 
    “It is truth that the larger community is always a sum total and a 
    reflection of its individual families. We cannot continue to ignore 
    the current lack of the moral values which is glaringly evident in 
    our leadership at all levels of the Nigerian society,” she said.
She noted that this was a reflection of what is pervasive at the 
    family level were there is serious moral disintegration, which need 
    to be addressed on a national agenda. “In a nation where the 
    majority of its families live in abject poverty and deprivation of 
    all sorts, where basic amenities like education and health are 
    handled with non-chalance 
    and a gross lack of probity, parents and families in such a nation 
    cannot but be demoralised, incapacitated and weak,” Itsueli 
    said.
She stressed that any society whose families are so weak can 
    have no solid identity, no impressive institutions and no core 
    values. She therefore enjoined that it was time we recognised at 
    all levels the importance of revamping the family structure to 
    allow the family regain its traditional status and its power to 
    effect positive change in the society.
The congress in Abuja organised by a coalition of 
    non-governmental organisations, Foundation for African Cultural 
    Heritage (FACH), which interest is in the promotion of good family 
    values, had various speakers who spoke basically on the need to 
    promote good family values. The congress was a pre-congress for the 
    World Congress of Families billed for early August in 
    Netherlands.
It was to encourage all stakeholders to take interest in the 
    traditional family formation – being the man, the woman and the 
    children- and do all it 
    entails to ensure that the traditional family is structured to 
    bring up good children who would be stable and responsible citizens 
    that would turn out to be the leaders of tomorrow.
It was on this note that the Executive Secretary, Institute for 
    Work and Family Integration, Mrs. Regina Bazuaye said that 
    all the problems in the society today emanate from having people 
    who were not well formed as children and when they grew up to 
    become adults, they could not make good citizens. “If children were 
    well brought up, giving the proper foundation by the parents, they 
    would grow up to be responsible citizens, adults and parents who 
    would also want to bring up children who are equally well brought 
    up,” she added.
Bazuaye, who said FACH is trying to make every one awaken to the 
    responsibility of engendering good family values, noted that the 
    impressive turn out and interactive section at the Abuja congress 
    went a long way to show that people are really keen on promoting 
    good family values. “What we have decided to do, either through 
    individual NGO levels or under FACH, is to keep on carrying out 
    various activities that would help in promoting laws that would 
    also help to keep the family firmly rooted as it fights against 
    things that are anti-family,” she added.
FACH, Bazuaye said is also concerned about how the Nigerian came 
    about children that are drug addicts and streets kids. This, she 
    noted was because the parents have fallen short of their 
    responsibilities in the pursuit for wealth. “We want people to know 
    that you have to work to earn a living but you don’t have to spend 
    all your time working, you have to also have time for your family 
    and also be in a position to play your primary role because you 
    cannot assign your God-given task to someone who has no interest 
    whether your child turns out right or wrong.
For example, if you work 18 ours of the day, which means you 
    left home while your children were sleeping and then come back when 
    they are in bed, you would make all the money, fly them all over 
    the world and do whatever they desire, “but then you would not even 
    know your children because you do not have time to interact with 
    them, know them and form them. You only leave them at the mercies 
    of drivers, house helps and cooks. You have to be there for your 
    children right from day one and try to make friends with them”.
She said therefore that the coalition of NGOs was out to promote 
    work and family balance and family enrichment - what you need to 
    know and what you must do to bring proper upbringing to your 
    children so that they would come out right.
“If you do a check, most of the children who are drug addicts 
    come from wealthy and middle class family. They would not know 
    about drugs if they did not have the money to purchase it, but the 
    truth is that the parents have lost out on what it really means to 
    be a parent. They are not there to play the role which God has 
    given to them.
“So if you want to have your children turn out right, you have 
    to invest in it by creating the time for them and make your 
    children know what to do, when to do it and how to do it. You must 
    also teach your children how to go through life with the right 
    inculcation of the virtues, which is what would make them turn out 
    to be good children and good adults and in the long run, good 
    citizens”, has noted.
Every discussant at the Abuja pre-World Families Congress held 
    at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre with the theme, “Plan of Action 
    on the Family in Africa – Update,” centred on how to get families 
    right. It was obvious that everybody at the congress 
    recongnised the fact that the 
    problem in the world today is that parents have stopped 
    parenting.
Speaking further, Bazuaye said, “These days we are talking about 
    re-branding Nigeria, the focus should be on the children and 
    particularly the parents, getting them to know the importance of 
    their God-given role as parents. Being parents is not just bearing 
    a child; you have to give that child a good background so that the 
    child would turn out right and make you proud”.
She said FACH was also encouraging government to recognise this 
    fact that good parenting was a panacea to the development of the 
    society. The foundation, she said is also out to encourage 
    government to also introduce laws that cut across various sectors 
    to make it possible for people to know that whatever work they are 
    doing, they have to create time for their families, particularly 
    the upbringing of the children by spending quality time with the 
    children.
The negligence of the grooming children in right way, Bazuaye 
    stressed further, has so much negative effect on the national 
    economy. She was of the view that if the society has good citizens, 
    bribery and corruption would not be, noting, “If a child is brought 
    up to know what is right from what is wrong, he would not go wrong. 
    When you buy exams question for your children, you are more or less 
    encouraging corruption in the system. So everything stems from the 
    parents because if the parents show good examples to the children 
    by the way they conduct themselves, the children would turn out to 
    be like their parents whom they have seen living in particular 
    ways.”
Bazuaye, a social scientist by training, read industrial 
    administration at the University of Sawford, UK and also has post 
    graduate diploma in business administration from Sheffield 
    University, UK and has had various working experiences all around 
    Nigeria in the ministry, media and non-governmental organisation is 
    so particular about mothers playing their parental roles more than 
    any other person.
She stressed that though a woman needs to work to support the 
    income of the husband especially at this period, but in all of 
    that, she must not lose focus of her primary assignment as a 
    parent. “For me I believe that the upbringing of my children is my 
    sole responsibility and not somebody else’s. So no matter what I 
    do, I try to make sure that I do my bit and I think every mother 
    has to live up to that responsibility, no matter what work you are 
    doing.
“If you find yourself in a job that does not allow you time for 
    your family, I think you should re-examine yourself and know what 
    exactly you really want in life. Do you want the goodness of your 
    children, or is it your status or whatever you are seeking? 
    Sometimes you feel you are doing it for the children because you 
    want to give them the best, but if you truly examine yourself, 
    you’ll find out that you are doing certain things because you want 
    to belong to certain class.
“We have to have our focus right, we need to know what is really 
    best for our children at some point in time. So sometime you need 
    to re-address your career situation and see what you need to do to 
    adjust. It is important to have a career because it would empower 
    you economically and give you self-independence, but you also have 
    to have a balance. Employers also have to recognise that an 
    employee who is happy and has a happy home would give better 
    performance on the job,” she said.
Bazuaye therefore advised strongly that women must not lose 
    focus as regard their parental responsibilities. “Parenting is not 
    something you can outsource, it is something you have got to do 
    yourself and if you don’t do it right, you would end up with 
    children who would turn out to be 
    deliquence or bad adults. So you have to inculcate the 
    right virtues in them so they would grow up with these things being 
    part of them. And living the example of what you tell your children 
    to do is the best way to bring up your children because they would 
    live it better when they see the examples in you,” she 
    emphasised.

NigerianEnglish,must,"Now , every woman must learn to take care of her body first of all we all know that the body must be clean at all times, and that everyone must indulge in the use of a deodorant",deontic,deontic,deontic,SkHo_02,"Discover what works for you
I have told you before that no woman came out of her 
    mothers womb looking like 
    miss universe. Everyone does something. Well I must say there must 
    be a few naturals, but of a truth everyone enhances what they 
    have.
You must just try to discover what works for you. Our mothers, 
    grandmothers and great grandmothers all had their beauty secrets, 
    and you saw that they mostly had beautiful skin and lovely hair.
Today, I will be sharing a few beauty secrets with you and most 
    of them won’t cost you anything.
Before anything can work, you must as a woman learn always to be 
    well postured. \i mean you do not have 
    to slouch. You must always carry yourself well. 
    –whether you are walking or 
    sitting down, your back must be straight, shoulders straight and 
    stomach always tucked in. Every woman must always be posture 
    conscious.
So once that is in place, you must work on all you have. Your 
    hair must never be tacky or dirty. Make sure that your hair is 
    clean and you always have a style that suits your face.
Now , every woman must learn to 
    take care of her body first of all we all know that the body must 
    be clean at all times, and that everyone must indulge in the use of 
    a deodorant.
The real care your body needs is exercise. I do not think that 
    there is anyone who really genuinely loves to exercise but 
    everybody needs exercise to keep fit. Many women confuse work and 
    exercise.
Most of the time, work is stress, but exercise is consistent and 
    continuous activity or movement that increases the rates of ones 
    heart beat and the flow of blood to the heart. You can burn your 
    calories through exercise.
Now when it comes to the skin, I believe no woman should 
    compromise. You must know what works for the skin. I hear that 
    generally, and fruit that is good for eating is good for feeding 
    the skin.
So just like you feed the stomach, you must feed the skin. 
    Paw-paw, avocado pear, honey, oatmeal 
    , Milk, 
    Palmoil, Shea butter, 
    Pure Coconut oil, Aloe 
    Vera, etc are very good for the skin. You can just smooth over the 
    skin, and leave it for a while and wash off.
Every woman must know that steam is very good for the skin. It 
    moisturizes the skin, and opens up the skin pores so that the skin 
    can glow. A steam bath is a major part of the beauty therapy in 
    most spas, and beauty clinics. It soften the skin, so that whatever 
    you use on the skin after the steam therapy works well.
For those who do not go to the spa or a beauty clinic, you can 
    have the table top facial sauna at home, or you can boil water in a 
    bowl, and cover your head over it with a towel 
    ( you know the old fashioned remedy 
    our mothers has for a cold). No matter how you do it, getting the 
    steam on the skin is what matter. You should learn to steam, 
    exfoliate and massage your skin. The truth? You really do not need 
    me to be telling you this. All the information you need on how to 
    treat your skin is available on the internet.
Every woman must cultivate the habit of reading and browsing. We 
    are living at the greatest time in all history. A time where all 
    information is readily available. All you have to do is get on the 
    internet. So many experienced cosmetic surgeons and beauticians 
    volunteer all these information on the internet.
You must just search for the information and discover what works 
    for you. My advise though is that 
    natural nourishment is the best for the skin.
When you have taken care of your posture, your hair and your 
    skin, the next thing you must pay attention to is your dress sense. 
    Do you know that these days, dressing up beautifully does not have 
    to be expensive.
You must know how to shop right. If you are making your clothes, 
    with trial and error or through what others say, you will discover 
    a good tailor or dressmaker, and if you must buy ready made, if you 
    shop round, you can get good bargains.
The most important thing is that you understand you figure and 
    your complexion.
That way, you know what colours and what styles suit your 
    person. Anything you do or wear must enhance what you have, and it 
    must spell and smell class.
Finally, no matter what you do, drink plenty of water and eat 
    right. Water is very good for your system and for your skin. Make 
    sure that your food is giving you the nutrients that you need. If 
    you have access to goat milk and soya milk, I am told they are 
    better than cow milk . Best of luck.

Dear Sir,
DECENTRALISATION OF NDDC
It is pathetic to note that, since the inception of the Niger 
    Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which was 
    set-up to address the deprivation and 
    marginalization needs of the people, nothing tangible has been 
    achieved. Rather we find people in corridors of power at the NDDC, 
    speaking double tongues, deceiving their brothers, meting out great 
    inhuman treatment on their own lands. The NDDC is a study case of 
    deceit, a conception of flattery, using public funds meant for the 
    development of the deprived Niger Delta, for the pursuance of their 
    selfish political ambition which is not borne out of service, but 
    out of greed. The deplorable state of the Niger Delta region was 
    justified recently by Senators of the Federal Republic of 
    Nigeria.
With reference to the Vanguard newspaper of Friday, November 2, 
    2007, concerning the report titled, ""Senators want more 
    derivation revenue for Niger-Delta"", was the Senate delegation 
    that went on a tour of the creeks of Bayelsa, Delta and Akwa Ibom 
    states, for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with 
    the problems of the region. The Senators divided themselves into 
    three groups to cover the three states in question, and the Bayelsa 
    state group, led by Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike 
    Ikweremadu, was close to tears, when they came face-to-face with 
    the acute poverty and poor living conditions in the communities of 
    the states. On their return to Port-Harcourt, 
    they called for an increase in the derivation allocation to the 
    Niger Delta, to reverse the existing situation. The president of 
    the Senate, Senator David Mark, who led one of the teams to Delta, 
    on his return, also promised on his part, expedited action by the 
    Senate in reversing the decay in the region. His words: ""We 
    will legislate for peace in the Niger Delta, we shall provide for 
    the people through appropriation. We will not be frustrated or 
    deterred no matter the odds. We owe it to our conscience and the 
    nation. There is no going back"". But before we get carried 
    with such words, let us look critically on the body that will 
    invariably, be responsible to the implementation 
    of whatever policies or appropriation the Senate will come up with, 
    that is the NDDC.
The much talked about neglect of the Niger Delta region was 
    supposed to be handled by the NDDC, established by the immediate 
    former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, in 2000, with the statutory 
    responsibility of eliminating some of the ills chocking the life of 
    the people of the Niger Delta area. Let us note 
    that, huge amounts of money running into 
    billions have been pumped into the NDDC from the time of inception 
    till date, but yet the commission has nothing to show for it. The 
    Senate's visit to the region justifies this fact. So, it will 
    be a waste, if more money is channeled into NDDC 
    without properly sorting out the problems affecting the body. Just 
    like past governments have tried to address the neglect of the 
    Niger Delta region with the establishment of OMPADEC, DFRI, PTF 
    that could not achieve much, particularly OMPADEC that failed in 
    this regard due to many factors arising from the polity. The same 
    factors have found its way into the affairs of NDDC. The NDDC has 
    become highly politicized that it is regarded as a conduit pipe for 
    siphoning public funds.
It is on record that the top management staff of the NDDC 
     who incidentally are from the Niger Delta 
    region, had governorship ambition and thus rely on public funds to 
    achieve these goals, deceiving our ignorant brothers and sisters 
    that they have marching orders to address our developmental needs. 
    We pity them because they are more ignorant than the public they 
    strive to deceive. As far as we are concerned, they are a disgrace 
    to themselves and retinue of followers. From our own estimation, 
    NDDC is a failure not because the commission and its ideals are 
    strategised to fail, but because the managers of the 
    commission's funds are wicked, mischievous, bunch of thieves 
    with no conscience, whose stock in trade is to circumvent the 
    public goals for their own private aggrandizement. This attitude 
    has left the Niger Delta region to remain perpetually stricken with 
    abject poverty.
Similarly, at the tail of Obasanjo's reign, some oil 
    producing states like Delta, also established 
    their own Development commission known as Delta State Oil Producing 
    Area Development Commission (DESOPADEC), all for the same purpose 
    enumerated above, to satisfy praise-singers, loyalists and so on. 
    The total neglect of the Niger Delta region is the basis for the 
    persistent crises that has 
    enveloped the area, as a result of aggrieved youths who have taken 
    it upon themselves to pour the aggression on a misplaced priority. 
    The crises in the Niger Delta 
    region have developed gradually to 
    the peak of criminality, where it can be compared favourably with 
    the Middle East crises. It has 
    involved the killing of innocent people, hostage taking of women, 
    children, elderly people and expatriate staff of oil companies. 
    Life has no value here, just like  the 
    Middle East, the only difference is that, the 
    youths have not started suicide bombing in their operations; the 
    place has become highly militarized with clandestine activities all 
    around. People are still going hungry in the midst of plenty and 
    yet the NDDC has continued to exist. All we have around the Niger 
    Delta are abandoned projects, in the name of NDDC, yet a selected 
    few live in affluence, drive flashy cars, with well furnished 
    offices. This has made veteran leader E.K. Clark to condemn NDDC in 
    its entirety.
Other areas identified that should be held responsible for the 
    neglect and deplorable state of the Niger Delta 
    region, are the states and local government 
    leaders, who from 1999 till date, have received 
    enormous amounts of revenue and yet nothing to show for it in their 
    respective states. The Senators' visits along the creeks of 
    the Niger Delta states, mentioned 
    earlier, said their tour around these 
    states, was an ""eye opener"" to the 
    criminal neglect that has left the areas in a pathetic state. They 
    blamed all past and present governors and local government chairmen 
    for not judiciously using the capital coming into the states' 
    purse. This is very true, when one considers the various reports of 
    alleged misappropriation of public funds by the state governors 
    that has given the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission 
    (EFCC), enough assignments to battle with on 
    their tables. The issue of corrupt leaders is another huge topic of 
    its own , our concern here is, what 
    has NDDC done so far to alleviate the plight of the suffering Niger 
    Deltans? The obvious answer is, practically nothing!
We are yet to understand the master plan of the Niger Delta 
    , we have been waiting anxiously for 
    meaningful developmental projects that will impact on the lives of 
    the average Niger Deltans, we have 
    looked at the conscious attempts of these people at the NDDC to 
    loot public funds and only embark on projects, 
    when they are pressured by the presidency to commission some 
    projects. It appears the persons on the board are people without 
    the intent and interest of their own people. We pass a vote of no 
    confidence on the entire management team of the NDDC.
We strongly call for a change of the NDDC methods of 
    implementing developmental policies, and we 
    believe, this call is 
    eminent, in the face of the likely consequence 
    of the polity and the economy of the country. If this is not 
    checked now, it will likely increase  wave 
    of resentments, militancy, cry of marginalization and unwanted 
    destruction of lives, properties and oil installations. It is a cry 
    for transformation in the scheme of things, to provide for the 
    welfare of Niger Delta people, to stop the media hype over the 
    perceived success of the NDDC in the face of failure, and to 
    protect the continued interest of our dear country.
THE WAY FORWARD
Those at the helms of NDDC have not answered the real questions 
    of development in the Niger Delta region, or better still, have no 
    answers to it , hence, most of the 
    contracts they delve into are not peopleoriented. They neglect the real core issues that are supposed to 
    be taken care of, and go on with projects that are meant for the 
    local government councils . Projects 
    like painting of schools, erecting 
    schools fences, patching of 
    roads, boreholes, etc. We see this as a displacement of priorities, 
    therefore, we profer the following:
NDDC must be decentralized, to be established 
    in all oil and gas producing states, and the structure of the 
    board, would consist of a Chief Executive / 
    Managing Director, who will be reporting directly to the Presidency 
    on every activities concerning the 
    development of that state. The budget and allocations coming into 
    each state must be according to the oil and gas production revenue 
    accrued by such a state. Those that will make-up 
    the board in each state must be people that are honest with a 
    longstanding repertoire of proven integrity, with a 
    sincere passion to develop the Niger Delta area. Appointments 
    should not be based on sweet talking orators, 
    with exaggerated profiles.
.NDDC in each of the oil producing states 
    should have equal powers to dispense their duties. However, their 
    funding will be different, based on the quota each state can 
    generate. The projects and programmes embarked upon must be people 
    oriented projects that would be of immense benefits to the general 
    people  not a selected few. The projects so 
    far executed, have been concentrated in villages 
    of top men, Directors and politicians.
To checkmate this, the projects of these 
    states NDDC should be 
    monitored by credible third parties, individuals or organizations 
    that have no government or political affiliation, who are 
    independent and whose views can be relied on as unbiased. This will 
    ensure that projects are properly executed, and it will be what the 
    people actually need.
The Senators of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, having had for 
    themselves, an eye opening encounter with the 
    heart melting, nothing to write home about, deplorable state of the 
    Niger Delta region, should not encourage the continued existence of 
    NDDC (as the body with the sole responsibility of eliminating the 
    distress of the people). NDDC has not been able to justify the 
    billions of Naira that has been pumped into it for close to seven 
    (7) years now. Hence, we urge for the decentralization of the body 
    to allow a closer encounter from the state level with the 
    grassroots, where the problems are eminent.

NigerianEnglish,must,"The contextual theories restrict meaning to context, situation or use, words are not use in isolation but in context A word must be conceptualized before it contextualized etc",deontic,deontic,deontic,ess_04,"The quest for meaning dates back to the days of Plato, Aristotle 
    etc. Before now meaning was studied as a branch of philosophy. 
    Later in the 20th century, it was 
    situated in linguistics 
    Semantic is the technical name of the branch of linguistics which 
    deals with the study of meaning. Meaning was not referred to in 
    semantics but it was developed. Semantics tries to study meaning in 
    a scientific and objective way.
Meaning in natural language has no 
    straight forward jacked 
    definition because one word can stand for two or three things. 
    Thereby, making it ambiguous, classically unstable and illusive. 
    These factors have caused meaning to be the most elusive and very 
    controversial phenomenon.
So many people have tried to define meaning in different 
    derogatory statement. This knowledge is out to the ambiguity of 
    certain words or conditions. According to Palmer, the understanding 
    of meaning is the ability to understand and ascertain it in a given 
    context. Lyon also said that the meaning of a word is determined by 
    the use (context), i.e. the use can help you, the 
    context can help you but it cannot ascertain the exact meaning of 
    the word. J. R. Firth suggested that in order to 
    understand meaning. It must be split into some component defined by 
    Indication to some context.
These different approaches and controversies have given rise to 
    various theories of meaning
The first theory was the Nominal theories. These was the very 
    first attempt to solve the problem associated with the analysis of 
    meaning in natural languages. Nominal theory tries to find the 
    relationship between a name and the object, that what a particular 
    word means is the name given to the object. In other words, words 
    are names or labels for things or objects e.g. the 
    word cup that theory is a relationship between a 
    word cup, and the object 
    cup.
The nominal theories are useful to an extent in explaining 
    meaning but they are rather restricted. These restrictions are some 
    of the problems of meaning in natural languages. The nominal 
    theories could only explain proper nouns, onomatopoeic, some 
    adjectives but could not explain abstract nouns, verbs.
Another weakness of the nominal theories is the fact that it 
    cannot explain sentence meaning. For those reasons the nominal 
    theories are not regarded as an adequate and comprehensive method 
    of interpreting meaning in natural languages.
After the nominal theories came the conceptual theories. These 
    theories stated that, the form of 
    the word signified things by virtue of the concept associated with 
    the form of the word in the minds of the speakers of that language. 
    The meaning of a word or expression to be the concept associated 
    with it in the mind of the speaker or hearer. The theories are 
    subjective because it is subjective to individual interpretation. 
    In all the theories have it that meaning a mental picture, that is 
    called up in the mind, when a word is mentioned.
Just like the nominal theories, the conceptual theories has its 
    own weakness which makes it inadequate for the analyzing of meaning 
    in natural languages. Some which are, the fact that it does not 
    across culture and individual (no room for cultural differences). 
    It interpret meaning as concepts rather than name. It subject 
    meaning to subjectivism, thereby making meaning too 
    scientific
Contextual theories came after the conceptual theories was 
    dim inadequate to analyze meaning 
    in natural languages.
The contextual theories have it that meaning should be related 
    to context or use. That meaning should be studied in terms of 
    situation context, use, onward and observable correlates of 
    language behaviour.
The contextual theories defined meaning of a word to be its use 
    in the language thereby making meaning cultural bound i.e. meaning be tied to the use.
The contextual theories also has it own weakness, some of which 
    are: The contextual theories restrict meaning to context, situation 
    or use, words are not use in isolation but in 
    context A word must be 
    conceptualized before it contextualized etc.
I will recommend pragmatics as a current theory which can 
    address the problem of the previous theories like the contextual, 
    conceptual and nominal theories.
Pragmatic explain how a hearer can succeed in retrieving from an 
    uttered sequence of words the interpretation intended by the 
    speaker and also derive further information constituting the full 
    impact of the utterance. It also 
    analysis meaning taking into account not only the observable 
    aspects of a language event but also the unobservable. Pragmatic 
    covers the domain of concept, context, deixis, implicatures etc. It 
    also consider the meaning of a particular speech event uttered in a 
    particular situation.
In pragmatics the intentions of the speakers the effect of the 
    speaker's utterance on his listener, the implications of 
    saying something in a particular way, the knowledge and beliefs 
    about the world upon which both the speaker and the hearer rely 
    when they communicate are also taken into account in a pragmatic 
    interpretation of meaning with the result that the hearer 
    interprets what was intended and more.
Conclusion: It is for all these reasons that I consider 
    pragmatics as a current theory which can reasonably address this 
    problem associated with the analysis of meaning of natural 
    languages

Fingers of smoke infiltrated the room. The smoke entered through 
    the worm-eaten walls, creeping stealthily about like phantom spies, 
    hovering aimlessly in the air around the naked bulb, ghosts turned 
    back from wherever ghosts go. A rat scuttled on tiny legs across 
    the cracked floor to disappear into a dark corner the feeble light 
    could not penetrate.
The single bed on which Taju slept was dimly lit. It creaked 
    loudly with his every stir. The young man's face worked 
    restlessly. As usual, he muttered in his sleep. His close-cropped 
    hair crawled with sweat. The sweat paths crisscrossed and became 
    one with the images clashing in his disturbing dream. One was of 
    the X sign of imminent demolition scrawled on his workshop by the 
    Local Government officials, the scourge of illegal structures. The 
    other dream was of money. In his sleep, Taju could see only blazing 
    red Xs as he choked to a slow death in an ocean of rotten 
    currency.
He tossed. A frail ship rocked by stormy hostile waves. Taju 
    tossed, a sweat-stained pillow resting between his parted legs like 
    the bloated phallus of a giant. The mosquitoes and bugs that had 
    made the dirty mattress home feasted on him.
Taju slapped himself into abrupt wakefulness, hurling curses at 
    the grandfather of a mosquito that had eluded him. He sat up and 
    scratched the stub beard that his wife always complained about. 
    Three long raw-looking tribal marks glowered on each cheek. The 
    streaks looked like the memories of an unforgettable encounter with 
    a wildcat. Taju fished his chewing stick out of his pocket and 
    stuck it in his mouth, bleary eyes taking in the room. Mayowa was 
    already up and about. He could see the frayed folds of her mat in 
    the corner beside the small cupboard that held her few clothes.
Up in the rafters where the decrepit cobweb-coated skeleton of 
    the house was exposed, the clean sunlight outside sliced in through 
    the leaks in the roof like laser rays reaching to cleave a throat. 
    Taju coughed mildly. The smoke that curled lazily around the room 
    tickled his nostrils. He rose to rap irritably on the weak wall 
    through which the smoke sneaked in.
""You don start again o!"" he yelled.
There was no response.
Taju's strong teeth mashed the end of the chewing stick 
    bobbing in the corner of his mouth as he crossed to the window. The 
    glass had cracked in three places. He carefully pushed it open and 
    spat out the foam that had formed in his mouth. Soon, he would have 
    to head for his marked-for-demolition workshop to earn whatever 
    miserable money he could before the government's bulldozers 
    gobbled his livelihood. Right now, he was just content cleaning his 
    teeth with the bitter stick, spitting his guts onto the grassy 
    patch that was being slowly licked dry by the incoming harmattan, 
    listening to the neighbourhood reluctantly stir up to face another 
    of an endless calendar of hopeless days.
He heard Mayowa enter the room behind him, using her rapidly 
    dwindling buttocks to creak the door open. Her thin hands - rough 
    and hardened from ill-use - held a steaming plate of 
    eba. A tiny piece of meat cowed like a 
    shame-faced island in the sea of weak soup.
""Good morning,"" Mayowa said to her husband.
He grunted as usual in response.
She placed the food on the only chair in the room, a lopsided 
    wooden affair that had found its way into the room under obscure 
    circumstances. Mayowa pushed the chair closer to the bed.
""Your food is ready,"" she said, watching her husband 
    wash his brooding face with the water she had placed on the 
    cupboard while he slept. She was dark...black really, like the 
    fire-licked backside of her soup pot. The healthy glow her skin 
    once took pride in had faded. It had vanished with her past. 
    Disappeared with the nagging thoughts of defying her parents to run 
    away with her man, Taju. Mayowa loved this man who now sat before 
    her, pulling the food closer. She prayed regularly to God to make 
    the morrow better. At a score and four years, with her collarbones 
    now jutting out, making her look haggard and tired, Mayowa 
    didn't look four years younger than Taju. She seemed older, 
    liable to be broken and rudely flung asunder by unexpected wind.
However, one shy magic that lurked behind her reserved face 
    sneaked out occasionally to overshadow even the sun. Whenever it 
    did, it shrugged off the ill-fitting dust of age, the burdens of 
    the day, transforming her into a living radiance. That shy thing 
    was a smile. Just a little old smile.
""This is a different soup,"" Taju observed.
She said nothing. Next to being in his metalwork pumped arms, 
    this was the only other moment that meant so much to her. Watching 
    him eat. It always gave her a secret pleasure to see her labour 
    being appreciated in fistfuls.
""Where did you get money to make it?"" Taju prodded 
    again between mouthfuls.
Mayowa shrugged. He knew. She sold fruits according to the 
    seasons. Often, she took it upon herself to provide the meals. 
    Especially when he was flat and out...and touchy. Like now. These 
    gestures always hurt Taju's pride, making him hard on her. Of 
    what use was a breadwinner who couldn't win a soggy mouldy 
    loaf? She wasn't going to let him starve though. Mayowa 
    understood a lot. She had married a proud man now bereft of 
    everything but the tattered shreds of that pride. Stripped of that 
    too, he might as well crawl into a quiet hole and die.
He'd paused to stare at her, a ball of 
    eba precariously balanced on the toughened tips 
    of his fingers. Soup dribbled down his hairy arm. Mayowa looked 
    into his eyes and instinctively knew she had to answer before they 
    filled with another of those irrational rage only incapacitated men 
    seemed capable of summoning at will.
""Why do you ask these questions whenever I spend my money 
    to cook for you? Do you not trust me? Or you expect me to spend my 
    money on less important things when I know my husband is a little 
    down?"" She tried to stop there, but one thing more gnawed at 
    the back of her mind. ""You know where I get the money from, 
    Taju. Why do you still ask? Does it matter that much?""
Taju didn't respond. For a delicate moment, he 
    couldn't. He simply held his ball of eba 
    and stared quietly at her, shame stirring restlessly in his 
    guts.
""Eat up quickly, my husband. The food will get cold and the 
    day is wasting a...""
""Who told you I didn't know that?"" he snapped at 
    her, aware the cruel bark in his voice was uncalled for.
She sighed sadly and looked away, folding up in submission. That 
    one action shook up the little food in Taju's belly, urging it 
    to push its way out as it had pushed its way in. He felt disgusted 
    with himself. He'd done it again! The unsuccessful welder of 
    metal versus the orange seller! Applause please!
Taju washed his hand quickly and rose. He had to get out.
Mayowa stood up too, her eyes shooting up from the barely 
    touched breakfast.
""You didn't finish your food...""
""Eat it,"" he said gruffly. ""I don't feel 
    hungry.""
He knew it was a lie.
Tears seeped slowly into the corner of Mayowa's eyes.
""I didn't mean to offend you my husband. If you must 
    know, I sold a lot of oranges to one nursery school at Agege. 
    Isn't my money your money too?""
""Will you leave me alone!"" Taju yelled at her, 
    deriving a sadistic satisfaction from the way she flinched, a silky 
    curtain struck by a sudden draught. He grabbed his shirt, slipped 
    on his much sewn rubber sandals and hurried out of the room.
Outside, Taju quickly disappeared in the time-pressed mass of 
    work-bound people. He slid past beggars who were making themselves 
    comfortable for the long day ahead. At a bus stop, he noticed the 
    authorities were yet to remove the dead and stiff and 
    starting-to-stink corpse of a prophet who'd died of hunger, 
    having refused to eat because his ""god"", a rock he always 
    carried around, never ate. In the gutter, the wet cover of an old 
    issue of the Weekend Concord blazed the 
    headline: NIGERIANS SAY NO TO WORLD BANK LOAN!
His anger dissipated in the yet unpolluted morning breeze.
Taju had a good woman in Mayowa. He knew that. He had known it 
    while he courted her during his apprenticeship at Ibadan. And she 
    had matured into a good woman now, two years after their elopement 
    to marry and dwell in Lagos. She was a good woman. It was with 
    himself he felt at odds. What other way was there to express your 
    own inadequacy other than lashing out at the world? And if that 
    world moved so fast and stayed leeringly out of reach, 
    wouldn't the option be to lash out blindly at the nearest 
    person?
""Mayowa,"" he said dully.
A suited man glanced at his troubled face...and walked a little 
    faster, throwing uneasy looks behind him.
Taju mentally cautioned himself not to think out loud 
    anymore.
""Mayowa,"" he said almost immediately.
Her constant companionship worked at preventing his frustrations 
    from crowding in to consume him. All his efforts were never going 
    to be adequate to make him comfortable financially...He knew the 
    times did not permit that. Whole families hung out at roadsides 
    with begging bowls, wailing...His own condition hadn't 
    deteriorated to that point. Mayowa had been feeding him, he wished 
    there was something sane he could do about it...
Hassan was waiting for him at the workshop. He was perched on 
    the warm bonnet of his Mercedes Benz car, gazing contemptuously 
    around the sparse surrounding of Taju's workplace. Peeling 
    paint on a crumbling, tipsy plank read T JU WELD NG WORKS. Beneath 
    it, a sheet of metal being gradually devoured by rust rested in the 
    timid shadow of a small wooden shed with a padlocked door. The mud 
    forge lay dead, amidst chips and bits of iron, lonely echoes of the 
    occasional cheap job.
On sighting Hassan, Taju began the first motions of a hasty 
    retreat. But his heavily bearded friend's bruisingly 
    penetrating eyes settled on him, a heavy load. Taju froze. His taut 
    lips stretched into a forced smile and reluctant legs lugged him 
    forward.
""Ah, Hassan,"" he called with forced geniality, 
    ""it is you.""
The bearded man appraised him in silence, his eyes distinctly 
    narrowed in displeasure.
The eternity of a difficult second.
""Did I just see you trying to avoid me, Taju?"" he 
    asked.
A surprised look hurriedly manufactured.
""Aha!"" replied Taju, ""why now? Why would I want 
    to avoid my good friend?""
""Perhaps you imagine I have come to collect the ban I gave 
    you to start this miserable business.""
Both of them glanced at the shed. The bleeding X left on its 
    only window by the Local Government officials glared like a fresh 
    wound. It seemed to be accusing Taju. Failure, 
    it said. Taju quickly looked away.
""I could have paid you. Hassan. Business has been 
    bad...""
''Business was never good!"" Hassan barked.
His lips could not be seen. Half of his face was lost in a small 
    forest of hair. Only his tongue showed as he talked, flicking about 
    sloppily.
""Do you think people who go into business never make 
    initial connections before they set off? You expect jobs to just 
    walk off the streets into your lap? You make me laugh, Taju. Look, 
    you and I have known each other ever since our childhood days. I 
    know enough about you to be sure you don't have what it takes 
    to run a business. You'll be better working under 
    someone.""
They had gone through this before.
Taju stared at the ground with contrition, like a whipped 
    dog.
""Everything could change, Taju,"" Hassan pursued. 
    ""One little price and you will never have to work until your 
    dying day...""
""I can't do it!"" Taju yelled.
He had to fling the words out of his mouth, wrench them out of a 
    pained soul.
""No, I cannot,"" he repeated, shuffling uncomfortably 
    on the spot like a child who needed desperately to urinate. 
    ""How can I do such a thing?""
""I did!"" Hassan responded.
""Yes, you did! I 
    cannot! Will not!"" Taju was almost panting now.
Some passers-by looked their way. He ignored them.
""Everything.. .lost everything for me! Are you 
    inhuman?""
""Not inhuman, practical."" Hassan said, staring coolly 
    at him. ""You could say that's my second name now. You 
    think I am inhuman, and that is why you remain nowhere today, 
    sub-human so many months after we both left welding 
    apprenticeship.""
Hassan had a night black mole between his eyes, and as he 
    talked, the mole looked reproaching...like a worm-hole about to 
    suck the world into a void.
The mole reminded Taju of the biblical pass-over 
    mark, like in the Moses movie he had gone to see with 
    Mayowa in Ibadan when they had been younger and still innocent. But 
    this mark wasn't in blood and on a door. It was black and on 
    his friend's forehead.
A rueful smile touched the corners of Taju's mouth as 
    another thought occurred to him. He has red paint on his workshop. 
    Red paint could pass for blood. His was a 
    pass-through sign. The bulldozer would soon come 
    visiting...
Hassan's mole had to be a pass-over 
    sign. The mark hadn't been on his friend's face while 
    they grew up in Ibadan. It had come about the time they settled in 
    Lagos: him, Hassan and Fadeke, his wife, and Mayowa... There were 
    only three of them left now. Fadeke had mysteriously disappeared as 
    soon as they touched Lagos...and the mole had appeared just as 
    mysteriously... Hassan's life had changed thereafter because 
    poverty had passed him by...
"".. .Lagos, you thought I didn't have my reasons for 
    wanting us to come down?"" Hassan was still talking.
Taju had missed most of it.
""...Or you thought it was only because of stupid dreams 
    like yours that I came down here? I came with my mind made up on 
    what I was coming to do. I had to be away from people who knew me 
    to do it, but I also had to be close to an economically viable 
    place so I could at least justify it. My fleet of luxurious buses 
    now ply the interstate route, Taju, and my other investments yield 
    good money. Why don't you stop being sentimental? Let your 
    brain talk, not your heart. You can always explain a disappearance. 
    And if the worst happens, you can disappear with the kind of money 
    you would have. I can still take you down to the...""

Dear Sir,
DECENTRALISATION OF NDDC
It is pathetic to note that, since the inception of the Niger 
    Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which was 
    set-up to address the deprivation and 
    marginalization needs of the people, nothing tangible has been 
    achieved. Rather we find people in corridors of power at the NDDC, 
    speaking double tongues, deceiving their brothers, meting out great 
    inhuman treatment on their own lands. The NDDC is a study case of 
    deceit, a conception of flattery, using public funds meant for the 
    development of the deprived Niger Delta, for the pursuance of their 
    selfish political ambition which is not borne out of service, but 
    out of greed. The deplorable state of the Niger Delta region was 
    justified recently by Senators of the Federal Republic of 
    Nigeria.
With reference to the Vanguard newspaper of Friday, November 2, 
    2007, concerning the report titled, ""Senators want more 
    derivation revenue for Niger-Delta"", was the Senate delegation 
    that went on a tour of the creeks of Bayelsa, Delta and Akwa Ibom 
    states, for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with 
    the problems of the region. The Senators divided themselves into 
    three groups to cover the three states in question, and the Bayelsa 
    state group, led by Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike 
    Ikweremadu, was close to tears, when they came face-to-face with 
    the acute poverty and poor living conditions in the communities of 
    the states. On their return to Port-Harcourt, 
    they called for an increase in the derivation allocation to the 
    Niger Delta, to reverse the existing situation. The president of 
    the Senate, Senator David Mark, who led one of the teams to Delta, 
    on his return, also promised on his part, expedited action by the 
    Senate in reversing the decay in the region. His words: ""We 
    will legislate for peace in the Niger Delta, we shall provide for 
    the people through appropriation. We will not be frustrated or 
    deterred no matter the odds. We owe it to our conscience and the 
    nation. There is no going back"". But before we get carried 
    with such words, let us look critically on the body that will 
    invariably, be responsible to the implementation 
    of whatever policies or appropriation the Senate will come up with, 
    that is the NDDC.
The much talked about neglect of the Niger Delta region was 
    supposed to be handled by the NDDC, established by the immediate 
    former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, in 2000, with the statutory 
    responsibility of eliminating some of the ills chocking the life of 
    the people of the Niger Delta area. Let us note 
    that, huge amounts of money running into 
    billions have been pumped into the NDDC from the time of inception 
    till date, but yet the commission has nothing to show for it. The 
    Senate's visit to the region justifies this fact. So, it will 
    be a waste, if more money is channeled into NDDC 
    without properly sorting out the problems affecting the body. Just 
    like past governments have tried to address the neglect of the 
    Niger Delta region with the establishment of OMPADEC, DFRI, PTF 
    that could not achieve much, particularly OMPADEC that failed in 
    this regard due to many factors arising from the polity. The same 
    factors have found its way into the affairs of NDDC. The NDDC has 
    become highly politicized that it is regarded as a conduit pipe for 
    siphoning public funds.
It is on record that the top management staff of the NDDC 
     who incidentally are from the Niger Delta 
    region, had governorship ambition and thus rely on public funds to 
    achieve these goals, deceiving our ignorant brothers and sisters 
    that they have marching orders to address our developmental needs. 
    We pity them because they are more ignorant than the public they 
    strive to deceive. As far as we are concerned, they are a disgrace 
    to themselves and retinue of followers. From our own estimation, 
    NDDC is a failure not because the commission and its ideals are 
    strategised to fail, but because the managers of the 
    commission's funds are wicked, mischievous, bunch of thieves 
    with no conscience, whose stock in trade is to circumvent the 
    public goals for their own private aggrandizement. This attitude 
    has left the Niger Delta region to remain perpetually stricken with 
    abject poverty.
Similarly, at the tail of Obasanjo's reign, some oil 
    producing states like Delta, also established 
    their own Development commission known as Delta State Oil Producing 
    Area Development Commission (DESOPADEC), all for the same purpose 
    enumerated above, to satisfy praise-singers, loyalists and so on. 
    The total neglect of the Niger Delta region is the basis for the 
    persistent crises that has 
    enveloped the area, as a result of aggrieved youths who have taken 
    it upon themselves to pour the aggression on a misplaced priority. 
    The crises in the Niger Delta 
    region have developed gradually to 
    the peak of criminality, where it can be compared favourably with 
    the Middle East crises. It has 
    involved the killing of innocent people, hostage taking of women, 
    children, elderly people and expatriate staff of oil companies. 
    Life has no value here, just like  the 
    Middle East, the only difference is that, the 
    youths have not started suicide bombing in their operations; the 
    place has become highly militarized with clandestine activities all 
    around. People are still going hungry in the midst of plenty and 
    yet the NDDC has continued to exist. All we have around the Niger 
    Delta are abandoned projects, in the name of NDDC, yet a selected 
    few live in affluence, drive flashy cars, with well furnished 
    offices. This has made veteran leader E.K. Clark to condemn NDDC in 
    its entirety.
Other areas identified that should be held responsible for the 
    neglect and deplorable state of the Niger Delta 
    region, are the states and local government 
    leaders, who from 1999 till date, have received 
    enormous amounts of revenue and yet nothing to show for it in their 
    respective states. The Senators' visits along the creeks of 
    the Niger Delta states, mentioned 
    earlier, said their tour around these 
    states, was an ""eye opener"" to the 
    criminal neglect that has left the areas in a pathetic state. They 
    blamed all past and present governors and local government chairmen 
    for not judiciously using the capital coming into the states' 
    purse. This is very true, when one considers the various reports of 
    alleged misappropriation of public funds by the state governors 
    that has given the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission 
    (EFCC), enough assignments to battle with on 
    their tables. The issue of corrupt leaders is another huge topic of 
    its own , our concern here is, what 
    has NDDC done so far to alleviate the plight of the suffering Niger 
    Deltans? The obvious answer is, practically nothing!
We are yet to understand the master plan of the Niger Delta 
    , we have been waiting anxiously for 
    meaningful developmental projects that will impact on the lives of 
    the average Niger Deltans, we have 
    looked at the conscious attempts of these people at the NDDC to 
    loot public funds and only embark on projects, 
    when they are pressured by the presidency to commission some 
    projects. It appears the persons on the board are people without 
    the intent and interest of their own people. We pass a vote of no 
    confidence on the entire management team of the NDDC.
We strongly call for a change of the NDDC methods of 
    implementing developmental policies, and we 
    believe, this call is 
    eminent, in the face of the likely consequence 
    of the polity and the economy of the country. If this is not 
    checked now, it will likely increase  wave 
    of resentments, militancy, cry of marginalization and unwanted 
    destruction of lives, properties and oil installations. It is a cry 
    for transformation in the scheme of things, to provide for the 
    welfare of Niger Delta people, to stop the media hype over the 
    perceived success of the NDDC in the face of failure, and to 
    protect the continued interest of our dear country.
THE WAY FORWARD
Those at the helms of NDDC have not answered the real questions 
    of development in the Niger Delta region, or better still, have no 
    answers to it , hence, most of the 
    contracts they delve into are not peopleoriented. They neglect the real core issues that are supposed to 
    be taken care of, and go on with projects that are meant for the 
    local government councils . Projects 
    like painting of schools, erecting 
    schools fences, patching of 
    roads, boreholes, etc. We see this as a displacement of priorities, 
    therefore, we profer the following:
NDDC must be decentralized, to be established 
    in all oil and gas producing states, and the structure of the 
    board, would consist of a Chief Executive / 
    Managing Director, who will be reporting directly to the Presidency 
    on every activities concerning the 
    development of that state. The budget and allocations coming into 
    each state must be according to the oil and gas production revenue 
    accrued by such a state. Those that will make-up 
    the board in each state must be people that are honest with a 
    longstanding repertoire of proven integrity, with a 
    sincere passion to develop the Niger Delta area. Appointments 
    should not be based on sweet talking orators, 
    with exaggerated profiles.
.NDDC in each of the oil producing states 
    should have equal powers to dispense their duties. However, their 
    funding will be different, based on the quota each state can 
    generate. The projects and programmes embarked upon must be people 
    oriented projects that would be of immense benefits to the general 
    people  not a selected few. The projects so 
    far executed, have been concentrated in villages 
    of top men, Directors and politicians.
To checkmate this, the projects of these 
    states NDDC should be 
    monitored by credible third parties, individuals or organizations 
    that have no government or political affiliation, who are 
    independent and whose views can be relied on as unbiased. This will 
    ensure that projects are properly executed, and it will be what the 
    people actually need.
The Senators of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, having had for 
    themselves, an eye opening encounter with the 
    heart melting, nothing to write home about, deplorable state of the 
    Niger Delta region, should not encourage the continued existence of 
    NDDC (as the body with the sole responsibility of eliminating the 
    distress of the people). NDDC has not been able to justify the 
    billions of Naira that has been pumped into it for close to seven 
    (7) years now. Hence, we urge for the decentralization of the body 
    to allow a closer encounter from the state level with the 
    grassroots, where the problems are eminent.

    an avalanche of advertising usually follows and the catchiest 
    language is often displayed both on the print and electronic media 
    to demonstrate the benefits of deregulation of the down stream oil 
    sector. Social Services like health and education at all levels, 
    road construction and repairs, etc will improve considerably. When 
    claims of social amenities and the realities of the Nigerian social 
    conditions are almost polar as any disinterested observer would 
    report, there is need to ask what all the elaborate electronic and 
    print advertising has produced.
What seems to have happened, in the opinion of some social 
    scientists, is that there is some collusion between independent 
    marketers and the ruling class. Driven by sheer profit motives, 
    maximization of these profits become their psychological pleasure 
    or satisfaction. They operate their own ""collegiate system or 
    fellowship of profiteers"", according to Kenneth (ibid) and the 
    hapless consumer is simply helpless. This is hardly different from 
    how vehicle spare parts dealers operate in many parts of the 
    country. Through this kind of fellowship, they regulate the 
    activities of fellow dealers to ensure uniformly high prices of 
    their goods. This is clearly an unacceptable face of capitalism.
But what are the consequences of this ""collegiate 
    system"" of fuel pricing on the economy? Unfortunately the 
    reformists are either unaware of the negative side of deregulation 
    on which so much money is spent on so-called public enlightenment 
    or they simply gloss over it. Kenneth (2006:5) puts it 
    succinctly:
In a country where its economic life is tied firmly to 
    petroleum products, the effects of hikes in fuel prices are 
    rippling in every sphere of socioeconomic life. Prices of 
    transportation, goods and services, running of factories and 
    production have gone up astronomically.
Quite frankly this is the language government apologists would 
    prefer to be spared. But we cannot wish away harsh language because 
    it springs from harsh realities.
5.4 Reduction of Subsidies in Key Sectors like Education 
    and Health.
Now, let us look at the fourth reform. In our opinion this is a 
    contradiction of the panacea that removal of subsidies on petroleum 
    products would usher in, as claimed by the reformists. Let us look 
    at the situation more critically. First you remove fuel subsidy and 
    promise improvement in the education and health sectors. But the 
    immediate result is inflation. Then you remove subsidies on 
    education and health. Clearly you are contradicting yourself. Then 
    universities are going to be privatized and not allowed in the long 
    run to run alongside the private ones, as we find in the US. Along 
    with them hostels and lecturers' quarters are going to be 
    privatized. And so will teaching hospitals and general hospitals. 
    And what will be left-hapless Nigerians will presumably be put up 
    for privatization, won't they? When language is removed from 
    realities, the result is miscommunication and civil disobedience. 
    We must ensure that we do not go that far. That balance between 
    language and reality, language and truth must be maintained to 
    prevent a descent into Animal Farm.
What we have been trying to do so far is to sketch 
    -and we can only sketch in an 
    address of this nature-the 
    relationship between language and publicly announced government 
    economic reforms agenda. It is not trite to say that the agenda is 
    written in such a manipulated language that highlights only the 
    economic advantages while obscuring the ugly side of the situation. 
    Because the government is aware of this, it has to explain its case 
    in enlightenment campaigns in euphemistic and optimistic terms, 
    which other knowledgeable people outside the government may not 
    share.
6. Language and Development
Now that we have seen language in relation to the reforms 
    agenda, let us revisit an issue which we have ignored in this 
    country as long as we have been a nation, an issue as much related 
    to national development as the reforms agenda.
The reforms are basically economic and aimed at transforming 
    Nigeria into what we may call an 'African 
    Tiger' ultimately. In our opinion, however, they 
    are basically surface: they ignore the essential aspects of man as 
    flesh, blood, mind and language. Economic well-being is not the 
    only aspect of national development, defined by Essien (2003b) as 
    follows:
A process of cumulative change that results from 
    positive forces that raise productivity and real income per head, 
    create more employment opportunities and achieve a wider 
    distribution of gains from the change itself in a nation-state. 
    National development is multi-dimensional, encompassing political, 
    legal, socio-cultural, administrative and linguistic changes. In 
    all these dimensions of development, language is a common 
    denominator.
Before we discuss language in relation to development, can we 
    run through the other non-economic characteristics of developed 
    countries, in particular of the Western World? Politically, 
    developed countries usually have orderly and regulated patterns of 
    change (as recently demonstrated in the United States and the 
    United Kingdom) as well as democratic principles and institutions. 
    In addition they respect human freedom as guaranteed by the United 
    Nations Charter of Human Rights as well as the rule law.
Legally, developed countries have legal institutions, 
    structures, legal cultures that dispense justice without fear or 
    favour and that assume innocence until it is proved otherwise in a 
    court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore, the executive arm of 
    the government usually does not interfere in judicial matters.
Socio-culturally, socio-cultural institutions, practices and 
    awareness help to strengthen political stability, national ethos, 
    national identity and tolerance, among other things.
7. Language, an Unexplained Residual Factor of Growth and 
    Development?
In discussing factors that contribute to national development, 
    Meier (1976:2-5), a radical development economist, speculated that 
    there is an ""unexplained residual factor... the 
    unisolated source of growth"". It is our conviction 
    that unexplained residual factor will be no more speculative as we 
    consider the following sections.
7.1 The Role of Language in National Development.
If national development, as defined in section 6 above, is a 
    multi-dimensional enterprise, then, language has a very significant 
    role to play in it. Unfortunately this has either always been taken 
    for granted or been completely ignored in this country. What is 
    this role? We consider it from a general point of view of language 
    in society, the role it played and still plays in now developed 
    economies and the role it can play in Nigeria as a developing and 
    multilingual nation.
7.1.1 The Primary Role of Language
However development may be defined, one thing is certain, 
    language is a constant or common, denominator, as our definition in 
    6 above says, since no human activity can be envisaged without 
    language. Have we ever wondered what our mind would be like without 
    language as we know it? It is so easy to take language for granted 
    that we have never bothered to imagine a world without language. 
    Language would always be there as far we are concerned and 
    fortunately for humanity, it is always there.
However, in development, because the role of language is latent, 
    we tend to ignore its potency in our programmes and strategies. If 
    authors and implementers of development programmes and strategies 
    are deficient in their expressive or understanding power of 
    language, the programmes and strategies themselves would be poorly 
    expressed and poorly understood.
Insofar as man is 
    inseperably homo sapiens and homo loquens, insofar as 
    education, a vital ingredient in development, is inconceivable 
    without language and insofar as all notions, concepts, theories, 
    arguments, analyses and practices in all academic disciplines and 
    professions that enhance national development find expression in 
    language (or its proxy, eg codes), the role of language in the 
    national development enterprise cannot be over emphasized. Man is 
    not an automation: he is inextricably flesh, blood, language and 
    mind through which his thoughts, soul and spirit can find full 
    expression.
Development programmes would, therefore, be seriously flawed as 
    they have been in Nigeria and the new nations of Black Africa, if 
    language were not considered a major component of them. As we shall 
    see later, development paradigms elsewhere outside Black Africa did 
    not ignore language, because this uniquely human possession plays 
    an extremely important facilitatory role in thought, description, 
    analysis and argumentation that are so crucial in development.
But if language plays this extremely important facilitatory 
    role, it should not be allowed to restrict any part of the 
    nation-state from participating in the development process. Kelman 
    (1971), according to Bamgbose (1992), makes this point very 
    clear:
Kelman...lays down two major principles to any 
    official language. In the first place, it must facilitate patterns 
    of communication such that socio-economic institutions in the 
    country may function effectively. In the second place, it must make 
    it possible for different groups in the society to have equal 
    opportunities to participate.
7.2 Language and Nations
In this section, we will consider briefly the language 
    situations of some developed countries for comparison, instruction 
    and emulation, where necessary.
7.3 European Nations
It is common knowledge nowadays that there is hardly any country 
    in the world, including those in Europe, which is monolingual, 
    though there may be only one official language. Multilingualism, 
    official or not, seems to be the norm, as more and more individuals 
    and nations understand and embrace democracy. Even such seemingly 
    monolingual nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, 
    France, etc have their own respective multilingualism (cf Trudgill 
    1983:14ff). For some reasons, which should be instructive to us in 
    this country, these countries have been able to manage their 
    individual multilingualism reasonably well without sacrificing too 
    much the principle of what has come to be known as language 
    rights.
One way that European nations have been able to manage their 
    individual multilingualism is through national independence granted 
    to some local ethnic minorities. In this way from only what Deutsch 
    (1968) calls ""six full-fledged"" languages in AD 950, the 
    number increased to fifty-three ""full-fledged"" official 
    and national languages by 1937 in Europe. The number has further 
    increased since 1937, thanks to independence and democracy.
As each new nation was born a new national and official language 
    was also born. Such a language (or languages) became a basic 
    expression of identity and aspiration. Governments of such new 
    nations responded by embarking on language planning, that is 
    ""... a government authorized long term, sustained and 
    conscious effort to alter a language"", according to 
    Weinstein (1980:56). It is quite clear that nationhood, economic, 
    legal, socio-cultural and linguistic developments were integrated 
    in European nations. The new nations, of course, followed in the 
    footstep of the older nations like France, Italy, Britain, Germany, 
    etc. No wonder, then, European nations, old and new are where they 
    are-far above the new Black African 
    nations whose developments take no 
    congnisance of the enormous potential of language. When 
    Allen (1976) says that he who controls language , controls history, he/she is partially right. We 
    would say that he who controls language controls history and 
    destiny. Could this be why the British left their language behind 
    in the newly independent (so-called) African nations, or wherever 
    they ruled then without language planning comparable to that which 
    was done for new European nations like Norway? For the details of 
    what the older nations like France, Italy, Britain, Germany, 
    Russia, etc. actually did to their languages, see Essien 
    (2003b).
7.4 Asian Nations
Although records of what the Japanese and the Chinese did to 
    their respective languages are not available to us, we have little 
    doubt that they must have done essentially what the Europeans did 
    to their languages. In any case, as far as we know, the Japanese 
    language and the Chinese language have always been used by the 
    Japanese and the Chinese respectively for all forms of 
    communication. The Asian ""Tigers"" like South Korea, 
    Taiwan, Thailand, India, 
    Indononsia, etc., have recognized indigenous 
    languages as indispensable tools in national development. Language, 
    in our opinion, may therefore be Meier's ""unidentified 
    residual factor"" in development.
In essence, what we have said in these last two sections is that 
    the languages of European nations and Asian nations have kept pace 
    with the national development of these nations on both continents. 
    While these nations involve their mother tongues in the development 
    enterprise and succeed, Black nations of Africa rather withdraw 
    their own languages from this very vital enterprise and it eludes 
    them.
8 Conclusion
In conclusion, we ask, what are the Nigerian reforms introduced 
    by the government ultimately for? A political gimmick? We should 
    think not. To be seen to be doing something for the nation? We 
    would say yes. To respond to the demands of IMF and the World Bank 
    pressures?

NigerianEnglish,must,It is in this context that we must situate the decision of the Bayelsa committees to vote N1,deontic,deontic,deontic,ed_23,"An aborted presidential visit and a funeral
Two dubious public expenditure items from Bayelsa and Enugu 
    States were buried inside a few newspapers last week, causing 
    hardly a whimper among scandal-fatigued Nigerians, but reinforcing 
    the general perception that venality in public office has worsened 
    in recent years.
The first was the revelation that the 16 standing committees set 
    up by the Bayelsa State Government to organize a reception for 
    Umaru Musa Yar’Adua had submitted a bill of N1.2 billion out 
    of which N456 million had been shared out before Abuja abruptly 
    announced the postponement of the two-day presidential visit for 
    reasons still unclear.
The other curious bill was the N600 million burial expenses 
    submitted to the Enugu State Government by the committee planning a 
    state burial for Chief Christian Chukwuma Onoh, Governor (for three 
    months only) of old Anambra State.
Media reports last week quoted officials of the Bayelsa State 
    Government appealing to the committee members not to divert the 
    N456 million elsewhere since there was still hope that the visit 
    could be rescheduled soon. The governor’s security adviser, Chief 
    Pereneme Kpodoh, even wrote a rambling, sycophantic open letter to 
    Yar’Adua pleading for a rescheduling of the visit and blaming 
    Governor Timipre Sylva’s political opponents for aborting a visit 
    which he said would have brought ""positive changes"" to 
    the ""developmental landscape"" of the state. The 
    advertorial which ran in most national newspapers last week did not 
    say what positive changes a two-day presidential visit would have 
    wrought on Bayelsa’s developmental landscape that could warrant or 
    justify spending N1.2 billion on Yar’Adua’s reception.
Enugu and the other states that constituted the old Anambra are 
    yet to make public how much of the N600-million pricy burial 
    expenses they made available to the planning committee. But judging 
    from the vituperations and angry denunciations of the Enugu State 
    government last week by Onoh’s son, Joseph, it was clear that the 
    ever reticent and focused Governor Sullivan Chime did not play 
    ball. He must have been highly scandalized by the huge funeral 
    budget submitted by the planning committee and might have resolved 
    to throw it back at the committee, perhaps with an advice that they 
    could very well auction a part of Onoh’s vast estate to raise the 
    ridiculous funeral fee.
""Despite all the disappointment by the Enugu 
    government"", Joseph Onoh told newsmen last week on the eve of 
    the burial of his father, a wealthy lawyer and politician who was 
    said to have owned over 100 houses in Enugu alone during his 
    lifetime. ""We are ready to bury our father"". He accused 
    Enugu State government of frustrating ""our burial plans"" 
    and commended the ""high level of commitment shown by other 
    governors of the South-East"" – a hint that those other 
    governors must have been blackmailed to contributed a chunk of the 
    hefty burial sum.
The irony was lost on Joseph and members of the burial committee 
    that Onoh, a self-made man who was well known for his disciplined 
    and frugal lifestyle, would have fought against the very idea of 
    wasting N600 million scarce public funds on his burial. Had such a 
    budget been drawn up before his death, those who knew him swore 
    that he would have gone to court to stop the state government from 
    indulging in such a monumental waste. He would have seen through 
    the gluttonous proclivity of the committee members to pad up the 
    burial budget as part of the usual mercantile schemes to make some 
    quick money from every government-sponsored public event. Onoh 
    would have argued that the money be invested in building more 
    classrooms or in buying books for schools or in stocking hospitals 
    with drugs or in constructing a few rural roads or in drilling over 
    600 boreholes. As a shrewd businessman, he knew that these 
    investments would bring more tangible benefits to the people of the 
    South-East than a N600 million funeral revelry.
Cleverly, both the burial and presidential visit planning 
    committees did not provide a breakdown of how they arrived at these 
    bizarre figures. It is left to a bewildered populace to speculate 
    whether the committees had decided to put Onoh to sleep in an all 
    diamond coffin and make Yar’Adua pass the night in a diamond 
    bedecked bed in Yenagoa village and treat him to a feast of oysters 
    and lobsters. How did it all add up?
These two highly inflated budgets have once again shown our 
    absolute lack of regard for public money. We tend to see public 
    money as belonging to no one in particular and, therefore, have no 
    qualms squandering it on worthless causes. At every available 
    opportunity, we are often too eager to 
    device all sort of schemes to line up our pockets. It is 
    done with impunity. There is no sense of guilt or shame or 
    moderation. And it is getting worse by the day. It used to be in 
    hundreds and thousands of Naira. Today, it is in millions and 
    billions. Kleptomaniacs are getting more audacious. Because they 
    know that there are often no questions asked, let alone sanctions 
    imposed. Life has become one mad rush for material wealth, a 
    primitive acquisition of money, houses, cars, and wives and 
    mistresses.
It is in this context that we must situate the decision of the 
    Bayelsa committees to vote N1.2 billion for the hosting of 
    Yar’Adua and for the burial committee in Enugu to demand N600 
    million for the burial of Onoh. People generally see these two 
    events as a chance to partake in the sharing of the commonwealth 
    since public office holders and their cronies are also believed to 
    be helping themselves to such common resources.
One of the lessons we must draw from these scandals is the 
    abysmal failure of governance or the embarrassing poor quality of 
    leadership in the country. Why would any serious government allow 
    N1.2 billion (about N2.5 million per hour for the two 
    days Yar’Adua would have spent in the state) to be wasted in 
    hosting a leader who has not done anything in the last two years to 
    improve the lives of the people of the Niger Delta? What then is 
    the basis for all the hoopla and excitement about the visit? Would 
    these people spend their personal money with such recklessness? 
    Besides creating the Niger Delta Ministry, what has Yar’Adua to 
    show the people of the region as his achievements in the past two 
    years? Rather than make them richer with his presence, Yar’Adua has 
    made them poorer even by his absence (N456 million has gone with 
    the wind of Yenagoa).
The people of the Niger Delta must learn to hold their leaders 
    accountable for the use of their money. They must have the courage 
    to ask why hosting Yar’Adua for two days should cost them N1.2 billion. In the same vein, the people of the South-East must 
    ask their governors how much they actually coughed out for the 
    burial of Chief C. C. Onoh. They should demand to 
    know whether these governors allowed their states to be robbed in 
    broad daylight in the name of a needless state burial.

NigerianEnglish,must,It must be split into some component defined by Indication to some context,deontic,deontic,deontic,ess_04,"The quest for meaning dates back to the days of Plato, Aristotle 
    etc. Before now meaning was studied as a branch of philosophy. 
    Later in the 20th century, it was 
    situated in linguistics 
    Semantic is the technical name of the branch of linguistics which 
    deals with the study of meaning. Meaning was not referred to in 
    semantics but it was developed. Semantics tries to study meaning in 
    a scientific and objective way.
Meaning in natural language has no 
    straight forward jacked 
    definition because one word can stand for two or three things. 
    Thereby, making it ambiguous, classically unstable and illusive. 
    These factors have caused meaning to be the most elusive and very 
    controversial phenomenon.
So many people have tried to define meaning in different 
    derogatory statement. This knowledge is out to the ambiguity of 
    certain words or conditions. According to Palmer, the understanding 
    of meaning is the ability to understand and ascertain it in a given 
    context. Lyon also said that the meaning of a word is determined by 
    the use (context), i.e. the use can help you, the 
    context can help you but it cannot ascertain the exact meaning of 
    the word. J. R. Firth suggested that in order to 
    understand meaning. It must be split into some component defined by 
    Indication to some context.
These different approaches and controversies have given rise to 
    various theories of meaning
The first theory was the Nominal theories. These was the very 
    first attempt to solve the problem associated with the analysis of 
    meaning in natural languages. Nominal theory tries to find the 
    relationship between a name and the object, that what a particular 
    word means is the name given to the object. In other words, words 
    are names or labels for things or objects e.g. the 
    word cup that theory is a relationship between a 
    word cup, and the object 
    cup.
The nominal theories are useful to an extent in explaining 
    meaning but they are rather restricted. These restrictions are some 
    of the problems of meaning in natural languages. The nominal 
    theories could only explain proper nouns, onomatopoeic, some 
    adjectives but could not explain abstract nouns, verbs.
Another weakness of the nominal theories is the fact that it 
    cannot explain sentence meaning. For those reasons the nominal 
    theories are not regarded as an adequate and comprehensive method 
    of interpreting meaning in natural languages.
After the nominal theories came the conceptual theories. These 
    theories stated that, the form of 
    the word signified things by virtue of the concept associated with 
    the form of the word in the minds of the speakers of that language. 
    The meaning of a word or expression to be the concept associated 
    with it in the mind of the speaker or hearer. The theories are 
    subjective because it is subjective to individual interpretation. 
    In all the theories have it that meaning a mental picture, that is 
    called up in the mind, when a word is mentioned.
Just like the nominal theories, the conceptual theories has its 
    own weakness which makes it inadequate for the analyzing of meaning 
    in natural languages. Some which are, the fact that it does not 
    across culture and individual (no room for cultural differences). 
    It interpret meaning as concepts rather than name. It subject 
    meaning to subjectivism, thereby making meaning too 
    scientific
Contextual theories came after the conceptual theories was 
    dim inadequate to analyze meaning 
    in natural languages.
The contextual theories have it that meaning should be related 
    to context or use. That meaning should be studied in terms of 
    situation context, use, onward and observable correlates of 
    language behaviour.
The contextual theories defined meaning of a word to be its use 
    in the language thereby making meaning cultural bound i.e. meaning be tied to the use.
The contextual theories also has it own weakness, some of which 
    are: The contextual theories restrict meaning to context, situation 
    or use, words are not use in isolation but in 
    context A word must be 
    conceptualized before it contextualized etc.
I will recommend pragmatics as a current theory which can 
    address the problem of the previous theories like the contextual, 
    conceptual and nominal theories.
Pragmatic explain how a hearer can succeed in retrieving from an 
    uttered sequence of words the interpretation intended by the 
    speaker and also derive further information constituting the full 
    impact of the utterance. It also 
    analysis meaning taking into account not only the observable 
    aspects of a language event but also the unobservable. Pragmatic 
    covers the domain of concept, context, deixis, implicatures etc. It 
    also consider the meaning of a particular speech event uttered in a 
    particular situation.
In pragmatics the intentions of the speakers the effect of the 
    speaker's utterance on his listener, the implications of 
    saying something in a particular way, the knowledge and beliefs 
    about the world upon which both the speaker and the hearer rely 
    when they communicate are also taken into account in a pragmatic 
    interpretation of meaning with the result that the hearer 
    interprets what was intended and more.
Conclusion: It is for all these reasons that I consider 
    pragmatics as a current theory which can reasonably address this 
    problem associated with the analysis of meaning of natural 
    languages

NigerianEnglish,must,"However, we must not risk their effects, however mild, on sensitive sub-populations such as children, women of child-bearing years, the elderly, and people with suppressed immune systems",deontic,deontic,deontic,PNsc_08,"The Environmental Effects of (Excreted) 
    Pharmaceuticals
Concerns about the possible effects of pharmaceuticals, their 
    metabolites and other chemicals, including household products is 
    developing into a high profile issue in Europe, the United States, 
    Canada and other countries around the world. The presence of these 
    compounds and the inconsistencies in the way they are disposed has 
    made their presence in the environment inevitable.
After release into the environment, most pharmaceutically active 
    compounds (PhACs) also known as active pharmaceutical ingredients 
    (APIs) are eventually transported to the aqueous domain and are 
    expected to be only partially degraded and transformed into other 
    products by photo-transformative, physicochemical and biological 
    degradation reactions.
However evidence available now suggests otherwise. Every year 
    tonnes of these harmful chemicals 
    are emptied into rivers and other surface waters in the effluent 
    from sewage treatment plants since these plants generally are not 
    able to remove all trace constituents. Their sources in natural 
    waters are not limited to excretion of parent compounds and their 
    metabolites by individuals and pets but also include disposal of 
    unused medications to sewage systems, underground leakage from 
    sewage system infrastructures, release of treated or untreated 
    hospital wastes, disposal by pharmacies and physicians, and 
    humanitarian drug surplus to domestic sewage systems.
A recent study of three plant sites in India (Ankleshwar, 
    Nandesari & Vapi) by Greenpeace revealed that about 250-270 
    million liters of liquid and 100 million pounds of solid waste is 
    produced per day and per year respectively. About 19% of which is 
    from drugs and 5% from organic chemicals and 8% from pesticides. 
    Most of this is dumped into ground water and local water ways 
    surrounding the plants. Thus these water bodies now contain 
    poisonous chemicals such as benzene, 1,3- and 1,4-dichlorobenzenes. 
    Dichlorobenzene for instance is a persistent chemical substance 
    resistant to microbial degradation.
The presence of excreted pharmaceuticals and chemicals even at 
    low levels presents analytical challenges and the environmental 
    impact and public health effects of long-term, low-level exposure 
    and combinatory effects are potential detrimental to human health, 
    the environment and the flora and fauna. Consequently, it is 
    prudent to consider the options available to prevent excreted 
    pharmaceuticals and chemicals from getting into the environment and 
    reaching drinking water, surface waters such as rivers and lakes, 
    ground waters, and sediments. This will aid in forecasting their 
    potential long-term (chronic) effects on man, aquatic life and the 
    environment. The issue has become more pronounced due to increasing 
    concern as population density and consumption of 
    pharmaceuticals.
More worrying is the fact that pharmaceuticals in the 
    environment have become more persistent and even for compounds are 
    short life times, the effects of long-term exposure and combinatory 
    effects need to be addressed. Available literature suggests the 
    quantity of pharmaceuticals already excreted into the environment 
    is enormous; and will continue to increase as long as population 
    and pollution increase leading to a disruption of the delicate 
    balance of the ecosystem and environmental biomes, niches, food 
    chains, and the biodiversity of organisms therein.
The presence of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics in the 
    aquatic environment poses a potential threat to ecosystem function 
    and human health. Scientific findings from research carried out at 
    Trent University Canada revealed that after a 100 day exposure of 
    Japanese Medakas fish to the effluent water samples with 
    concentrations of 0.1 ppt estrone (a type of estrogen) and 
    other chemicals, the fish began to exhibit intersexual changes 
    (showing both male and female characteristics). At 1000 ppt all the 
    males transformed to females.
Another study by researchers in London found that exposure an 
    even ppt of estrogen will trigger the production of Vitellogen, a 
    female protein responsible for making yolk in eggs, in male fish. 
    American researchers in a separate report found that the exposure 
    of excreted pharmaceuticals has resulted in the sterility of male 
    walleys, birth defects in alligators and also other water dwelling 
    birds and species of wildlife.
In humans the effects of excreted pharmaceuticals can be 
    attributed to cancers, hormonal imbalance, immune disabilities, 
    birth defects, cancer (carcinogenic), fetal deaths, decreased 
    fertility, male and female reproductive dysfunction and is known to 
    interfere with hormonal and endocrine systems such as those 
    responsible for insulin and thyroid hormones.
Some pundits may argue about whether or not there are adverse 
    human health effects from cumulative lifetime exposures to the low 
    concentrations and complex mixtures of pharmaceuticals. However, we 
    must not risk their effects, however mild, on sensitive 
    sub-populations such as children, women of child-bearing years, the 
    elderly, and people with suppressed immune systems; by making 
    rhetoric out of the problem like humanity has other issues like 
    global warming in the past.
In other to arrest these negative trends and forestall future 
    eventualities, the following measures can be employed to address 
    the situation. Because numerous studies reveal that majority of 
    pharmaceuticals in the environment come from patient use, 
    individuals must be cautioned on the effects of such actions on the 
    future of coming generations and the long term diversity protection 
    of the environment.
The government and NGOs must make concerted efforts to educate 
    people on the dangers of dumping pharmaceuticals into the 
    environment and encourage them to report if noticeable any change 
    in water or environment that can be attributed to the presence of 
    pharmaceuticals in the environment. The academia should be 
    stimulated by the government and proper environmental legislation 
    put in place to spur research and garner rigorous efforts towards 
    investigating the short and long term effects of pharmaceuticals 
    excreted into the environment.
Enacted legislation should be enforced more strongly to arrest 
    the unwanted and wanton disposal of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, 
    agricultural chemicals and pesticides into the streams, rivers and 
    water bodies by individuals and industry. A database-cum-databank 
    of research into pharmaceuticals excreted into the environment 
    should be created to enhance the knowledge base of the situation, 
    its effects and proffer solutions based on the twelve (12) 
    principles of Green Chemistry which include; Prevent Wastes, 
    Renewable materials, Omit derivatization steps, Degradable chemical 
    products, Use safe synthetic methods, Catalytic reagents, 
    Temperature, pressure ambient, In-process monitoring, Very few 
    auxiliary substances, E-factor, maximize feed in product, Low 
    toxicity of chemical products, Yes, it is safe.
Approval and incentives should be granted to firms and companies 
    who employ green technologies and techniques in pharmaceutical 
    waste disposal. Finally policy and technological framework 
    structures must be created to identify more potent pharmaceuticals 
    as the target of future research on possible effects of 
    pharmaceuticals in the environment.
This way mankind can take a huge step in the quest to be more 
    sustainable-responsible for her action towards the environment and 
    future generations.

NigerianEnglish,must,She said therefore that the coalition of NGOs was out to promote work and family balance and family enrichment - what you need to know and what you must do to bring proper upbringing to your children so that they would come out right,deontic,deontic,deontic,PSsc_09,"Whatever Happened to Traditional Family 
    Structure!
The need to restore the African traditional family 
    structure to allow it regain its traditional status and power of 
    effecting positive change in the society was part of discussion at 
    a recent family congress held in Abuja, writes 
    Mary 
    Ekah
“The task of raising a child properly was a sacred one because 
    of its far reaching consequences for the security and survival of 
    the soul of the community. Fathers, mothers, grandparents, older 
    siblings, in-laws and relatives had a collective responsibility to 
    raise the young and each saw this as an obligation to the family 
    and the larger community. To fail to raise a morally responsible 
    person was to have failed the community and brought disgrace on 
    one’s family and kindred …”
This was the submission of the National Co-coordinator, Marriage 
    and Family Life Committee of the Catholic Bishops Conference and 
    Director of the Lagos Resource Centre, Mrs. Bridget Itsueli 
    at the World Congress Families held in Abuja recently. This was 
    said in recognition of the contribution of the African traditional 
    family to the development of good citizens and establishment of the 
    community’s identity, its outlook, values and goals.
The traditional societies, Itsueli said, recognises the 
    political and social significance of the family, noting however 
    that the modern Nigeria society seems quite ignorant of this truth. 
    “It is truth that the larger community is always a sum total and a 
    reflection of its individual families. We cannot continue to ignore 
    the current lack of the moral values which is glaringly evident in 
    our leadership at all levels of the Nigerian society,” she said.
She noted that this was a reflection of what is pervasive at the 
    family level were there is serious moral disintegration, which need 
    to be addressed on a national agenda. “In a nation where the 
    majority of its families live in abject poverty and deprivation of 
    all sorts, where basic amenities like education and health are 
    handled with non-chalance 
    and a gross lack of probity, parents and families in such a nation 
    cannot but be demoralised, incapacitated and weak,” Itsueli 
    said.
She stressed that any society whose families are so weak can 
    have no solid identity, no impressive institutions and no core 
    values. She therefore enjoined that it was time we recognised at 
    all levels the importance of revamping the family structure to 
    allow the family regain its traditional status and its power to 
    effect positive change in the society.
The congress in Abuja organised by a coalition of 
    non-governmental organisations, Foundation for African Cultural 
    Heritage (FACH), which interest is in the promotion of good family 
    values, had various speakers who spoke basically on the need to 
    promote good family values. The congress was a pre-congress for the 
    World Congress of Families billed for early August in 
    Netherlands.
It was to encourage all stakeholders to take interest in the 
    traditional family formation – being the man, the woman and the 
    children- and do all it 
    entails to ensure that the traditional family is structured to 
    bring up good children who would be stable and responsible citizens 
    that would turn out to be the leaders of tomorrow.
It was on this note that the Executive Secretary, Institute for 
    Work and Family Integration, Mrs. Regina Bazuaye said that 
    all the problems in the society today emanate from having people 
    who were not well formed as children and when they grew up to 
    become adults, they could not make good citizens. “If children were 
    well brought up, giving the proper foundation by the parents, they 
    would grow up to be responsible citizens, adults and parents who 
    would also want to bring up children who are equally well brought 
    up,” she added.
Bazuaye, who said FACH is trying to make every one awaken to the 
    responsibility of engendering good family values, noted that the 
    impressive turn out and interactive section at the Abuja congress 
    went a long way to show that people are really keen on promoting 
    good family values. “What we have decided to do, either through 
    individual NGO levels or under FACH, is to keep on carrying out 
    various activities that would help in promoting laws that would 
    also help to keep the family firmly rooted as it fights against 
    things that are anti-family,” she added.
FACH, Bazuaye said is also concerned about how the Nigerian came 
    about children that are drug addicts and streets kids. This, she 
    noted was because the parents have fallen short of their 
    responsibilities in the pursuit for wealth. “We want people to know 
    that you have to work to earn a living but you don’t have to spend 
    all your time working, you have to also have time for your family 
    and also be in a position to play your primary role because you 
    cannot assign your God-given task to someone who has no interest 
    whether your child turns out right or wrong.
For example, if you work 18 ours of the day, which means you 
    left home while your children were sleeping and then come back when 
    they are in bed, you would make all the money, fly them all over 
    the world and do whatever they desire, “but then you would not even 
    know your children because you do not have time to interact with 
    them, know them and form them. You only leave them at the mercies 
    of drivers, house helps and cooks. You have to be there for your 
    children right from day one and try to make friends with them”.
She said therefore that the coalition of NGOs was out to promote 
    work and family balance and family enrichment - what you need to 
    know and what you must do to bring proper upbringing to your 
    children so that they would come out right.
“If you do a check, most of the children who are drug addicts 
    come from wealthy and middle class family. They would not know 
    about drugs if they did not have the money to purchase it, but the 
    truth is that the parents have lost out on what it really means to 
    be a parent. They are not there to play the role which God has 
    given to them.
“So if you want to have your children turn out right, you have 
    to invest in it by creating the time for them and make your 
    children know what to do, when to do it and how to do it. You must 
    also teach your children how to go through life with the right 
    inculcation of the virtues, which is what would make them turn out 
    to be good children and good adults and in the long run, good 
    citizens”, has noted.
Every discussant at the Abuja pre-World Families Congress held 
    at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre with the theme, “Plan of Action 
    on the Family in Africa – Update,” centred on how to get families 
    right. It was obvious that everybody at the congress 
    recongnised the fact that the 
    problem in the world today is that parents have stopped 
    parenting.
Speaking further, Bazuaye said, “These days we are talking about 
    re-branding Nigeria, the focus should be on the children and 
    particularly the parents, getting them to know the importance of 
    their God-given role as parents. Being parents is not just bearing 
    a child; you have to give that child a good background so that the 
    child would turn out right and make you proud”.
She said FACH was also encouraging government to recognise this 
    fact that good parenting was a panacea to the development of the 
    society. The foundation, she said is also out to encourage 
    government to also introduce laws that cut across various sectors 
    to make it possible for people to know that whatever work they are 
    doing, they have to create time for their families, particularly 
    the upbringing of the children by spending quality time with the 
    children.
The negligence of the grooming children in right way, Bazuaye 
    stressed further, has so much negative effect on the national 
    economy. She was of the view that if the society has good citizens, 
    bribery and corruption would not be, noting, “If a child is brought 
    up to know what is right from what is wrong, he would not go wrong. 
    When you buy exams question for your children, you are more or less 
    encouraging corruption in the system. So everything stems from the 
    parents because if the parents show good examples to the children 
    by the way they conduct themselves, the children would turn out to 
    be like their parents whom they have seen living in particular 
    ways.”
Bazuaye, a social scientist by training, read industrial 
    administration at the University of Sawford, UK and also has post 
    graduate diploma in business administration from Sheffield 
    University, UK and has had various working experiences all around 
    Nigeria in the ministry, media and non-governmental organisation is 
    so particular about mothers playing their parental roles more than 
    any other person.
She stressed that though a woman needs to work to support the 
    income of the husband especially at this period, but in all of 
    that, she must not lose focus of her primary assignment as a 
    parent. “For me I believe that the upbringing of my children is my 
    sole responsibility and not somebody else’s. So no matter what I 
    do, I try to make sure that I do my bit and I think every mother 
    has to live up to that responsibility, no matter what work you are 
    doing.
“If you find yourself in a job that does not allow you time for 
    your family, I think you should re-examine yourself and know what 
    exactly you really want in life. Do you want the goodness of your 
    children, or is it your status or whatever you are seeking? 
    Sometimes you feel you are doing it for the children because you 
    want to give them the best, but if you truly examine yourself, 
    you’ll find out that you are doing certain things because you want 
    to belong to certain class.
“We have to have our focus right, we need to know what is really 
    best for our children at some point in time. So sometime you need 
    to re-address your career situation and see what you need to do to 
    adjust. It is important to have a career because it would empower 
    you economically and give you self-independence, but you also have 
    to have a balance. Employers also have to recognise that an 
    employee who is happy and has a happy home would give better 
    performance on the job,” she said.
Bazuaye therefore advised strongly that women must not lose 
    focus as regard their parental responsibilities. “Parenting is not 
    something you can outsource, it is something you have got to do 
    yourself and if you don’t do it right, you would end up with 
    children who would turn out to be 
    deliquence or bad adults. So you have to inculcate the 
    right virtues in them so they would grow up with these things being 
    part of them. And living the example of what you tell your children 
    to do is the best way to bring up your children because they would 
    live it better when they see the examples in you,” she 
    emphasised.

NigerianEnglish,must,"The global economic meltdown has caused job losses in many countries, but Nigeria seems to have been living with the problem of unemployment for so long that its significance must have been lost on the people",epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,ed_21,"Nigeria’s Unknown Unemployed
Recently, Labour and Productivity Minister Adetokunbo Kayode 
    admitted that Nigeria has no accurate figure of its unemployed 
    population. That honest admission is commendable, but we find it 
    unacceptable.  
Speaking at a conference of the Association of Vice Chancellors 
    of Nigerian Universities, the minister said that there was no 
    accurate figure of unemployed Nigerians, and so he had to adopt an 
    “anecdotal figure” of 40 million pending the report of the 
    committee set up by the Federal Government to determine the real 
    figure.  
According to him, the unemployed make up about 32 per cent of 
    the population. The figures are similar to those of the World Bank, 
    which have been disputed by some scholars. There are concerns that, 
    going by the evidence on the streets, the figure may be far 
    higher.  
However, there is no point arguing about the high rate of 
    unemployment in Nigeria. Even the Minister’s anecdotal figure is 
    depressing considering the country’s enormous resources; and scary 
    because of the economic, physical and psychological effects of 
    unemployment.  
One, there is a strong correlation between unemployment and 
    poverty, both of which are high in Nigeria.  
Two, it has high private cost to those directly affected. In 
    addition to the pain of poverty and deprivation, unemployment is 
    associated with depression, anxiety and low self-esteem.  
Three, its social cost is also high. Unemployment is associated 
    with higher levels of family breakdowns, alcohol and drug abuse, 
    suicide and crime.  
Four, and what should also be of concern to Government is that 
    unemployment affects the entire economy, not just those unfortunate 
    to be unemployed. Since many unemployed people have skills and 
    training that are not being utilised in production, national income 
    and production are reduced if these people were gainfully working.  
    
These are reasons why governments all over the world, worry 
    about rising unemployment and so strive to keep it at the barest 
    minimum. The global economic meltdown has caused job losses in many 
    countries, but Nigeria seems to have been living with the problem 
    of unemployment for so long that its significance must have been 
    lost on the people.  
The lack of reasonable unemployment statistics does not speak 
    well of the government. Of course, no proper planning can be done 
    without reliable statistics. That there is no statistical backup 
    explains why, too often, the nation cannot do effective long term 
    planning, and our penchant for always adopting ad hoc measures. 
    Indeed, how can a nation plan for a group of people without knowing 
    their number?  
Although the minister said a committee is working towards 
    scientific unemployment statistics, we are wondering when it would 
    be ready for use by a government that has gone past its mid-term. 
    Unemployment is one of the government’s 7-point agenda.  If it 
    takes two years and more to get the figures, how long then will it 
    take to provide the needed jobs?  
At this stage of our development, we should have a working 
    estimate of graduates from our tertiary institutions annually, what 
    job openings there are for them, what numbers would be left, what 
    they are likely to do to survive and what support can be given 
    them.  
We wonder what has become of the registration of the unemployed 
    by the National Directorate of Employment in 2007.  
As the committee continues its work, more and more people are 
    added by the growing number of universities and other tertiary 
    institutions to the unemployment figure.  
Also added are many artisans who depend on public electricity 
    supply but can no longer work because of the epileptic nature of 
    the supply. There are also youths who continue to abandon 
    agriculture in the rural areas for non-existent urban jobs and of 
    course, the victims of the global economic meltdown.    
Yet, there are other problems. Mr. Kayode  lamented that 
    “lack of proper skills, re-skilling, poor facilities for skills 
    development, lack of planning and lack of co-ordination, confusion, 
    inefficient application of scarce resources… greatly contributed to 
    put our country in a very precarious job deficit.”  
But it is not enough understanding the problems, or decrying the 
    situation. It is more helpful designing schemes and measures to 
    combat identified problems.  
Now that the minister has adopted the “anecdotal figures” of 40 
    million Nigerians, what plans are underway to decongest the labour 
    market? That is what will count for this government at the end of 
    the day. Government has an obligation to create job opportunities 
    or at the very least, create an enabling environment for private 
    enterprises to provide employment for people.  
We believe that the only enduring solution to unemployment and 
    poverty is economic growth.

NigerianEnglish,must,I must have seen her before then but it was only at the funeral that I was aware of her existence,epistemic,epistemic,epistemic,nov_07,"My Early Childhood
Shouldn't my mother, Dejubee, be the first person I was 
    aware of in my life, beside my good self? Funny enough she was not 
    the first person I remember knowing in my childhood days at our 
    quarter, Ikoti, in Ilesha. It was my paternal grandfather, Loogun 
    Falekun, the Ashipa of Ikoti. The little I remembered about him was 
    the terrible pain he periodically inflicted on me in the process of 
    scraping my head bare of hair. Most of the pain was concentrated at 
    the back of my head, at the junction of the neck and the head. The 
    instrument of torture was a piece of steel, probably under a foot 
    long, but to my child's eye it was very long indeed.
Next I remember my paternal grandmother, Yeye Oni Eleran, the 
    third name indicating her occupation of trading in sheep and goats 
    in the market. She used to take me to the market at Itakogun. But 
    apparently she soon decided to wean me off her and the market. One 
    day she set off for the market without me. Shortly after, I decided 
    to follow after her. I had not gone far from home when I lost my 
    bearing, neither knowing the way forward to the market nor backward 
    to our house. I do not know what good Samaritan brought me to my 
    grandmother Yeye but I do recall the flogging I got for disobeying 
    Yeye and following after her to the market when she had told me to 
    stay at home.
Then what apparently was an important event to Yeye happened at 
    Ishokun, another quarter at Ilesha. Her younger daughter Aina had 
    her first baby, a boy. Yeye had to relocate temporarily to Ishokun 
    to look after my Aunt Aina and her baby, and she had to take me 
    along as no one would look after me at Ikoti without Yeye. On the 
    second or third night in our new place an army of soldier ants 
    invaded the house, to the consternation of everyone except the new 
    baby. That new baby is my cousin Afolabi Alatise. There was nobody 
    around educated enough to record the day he was born. I reckon I 
    was about four years old at the time, and since I was born in 1918, 
    I put his year of birth as 1922.
Something happened to my grandfather that made the whole 
    household go into festivities for three days. Grandfather was not 
    moving around but everybody was milling around him. It was a 
    continuing feasting, and we kids liked it. On the third day 
    Grandfather, who all the time was not talking or moving, was being 
    wrapped in several bales of cloth. Even young as I was I knew this 
    could not do him much good. Then when the body was being lowered 
    into a pit that had been dug apparently for the purpose, I had no 
    doubt in my mind that the people lowering Grandfather into the pit 
    were committing an unfriendly act and that therefore it was time 
    for those who loved him to rise up to the challenge. So I shouted 
    curses on the enemy, biting their ankles, till I was carried away 
    yelling, that I might allow people to complete the burial 
    ceremony.
That was how my grandfather Falekun died just as I was becoming 
    aware of him in my life. The title Loogun before his name suggested 
    he was a warrior by profession but I suspect that he did not rise 
    above the middle ranks as did Ogedengbe, Arimoro and Obe. Indeed my 
    elder cousin Abe Fakuwajo told me this unedifying story about him 
    which must have been told by Grandfather himself or by Abe's 
    father who was Grandfather's elder brother. On one occasion 
    when the enemy had sacked the town of Ilesha and men, women and 
    children were being led away to captivity by the conquering army, 
    my grandfather was being dragged away by a man when they met a 
    horseman of the conquering army who forcibly wrested my grandfather 
    from his first captor and forcibly seated him on his horse and rode 
    away. The man deprived of a slave dared not complain to anybody as 
    it was battle justice and the horseman was the stronger of the 
    two.
My grandfather riding at the back of his new master noticed that 
    he had placed his sword in its sheath behind him. He carefully 
    pulled out the sword and with one stroke dealt his new master a 
    mortal blow. Then he alighted from the horse, beckoned to the other 
    man who was still smarting from the unfair dispossession of a 
    slave, and surrendered to him both himself and the horse. The 
    amazed master took him eventually to Sagainu his home-town. There 
    he made him his head slave in recognition of his loyalty to him and 
    his integrity in the battlefield at Ilesha.
Grandfather Loogun Falekun came back to Ilesha via Abeokuta 
    about 1890, after the famous Kiriji War and the treaties of peace 
    and friendship between the British Government and the Kings of the 
    subtribes of Yorubaland that had taken part in the devastating war. 
    He had married Yeye Oni at Sagamu. On his way back to Ilesha after 
    the war he had stayed for some time in Abeokuta where my aunt 
    Fayombo and my father were probably born.
Grandfather certainly had other wives before and after marrying 
    Grandmother Oni but these other wives had only daughters and only 
    Oni had two sons Aluko and Ayeni. Another wife, Adenike, senior to 
    Oni, also had an only son Jegede, who was older than my father.
I do not know how large my grandfather's extended family 
    was at Ilesha before they were scattered by war and he ended up in 
    slavery at Sagamu. At the ingathering after the Kiriji War not many 
    people turned up at Ilesha. They had either died in slavery or only 
    a few members of the household went into slavery.
There were Falekun, his elder brother a diviner by profession, 
    and a sister. Among the relatives that I was told of are Turton, 
    popularly known as Akowe Ogburuu, and Teju Oyeleye's mother at 
    Ogbon Agbede near Ikoti.
The one woman who gave me much food and much attention during my 
    grandfather's funeral festivities I came to know as my mother 
    Dejubee. I must have seen her before then but it was only at the 
    funeral that I was aware of her existence. She and my father Aluko 
    had come back from Ojoku, a village near Offa in Ilorin Province, 
    to take part in my grandfather's funeral. And after the 
    funeral they decided to take me back with them to Ojoku where they 
    were Osomalo traders.
The first leg of some twenty odd miles journey was from Ilesha 
    to Oshogbo and I did it partly strapped to the back of my mother, 
    and I partly rode on the shoulders of my father and my uncle Ayeni. 
    Between Oshogbo and Apata Aje Station I rode on a train for the 
    first time. I was amazed and confused when I was hustled out of the 
    train at the last station, my father telling me that we were at 
    journey's end. I was not aware that the train had left Oshogbo 
    at all. Apparently the peculiar noise of the locomotive engine 
    signified motion in the train! I again rode on the back of my 
    mother and the shoulders of my father and my uncle for the few 
    miles from the railway station to the village of Ojoku.
I reckon I was four years old when my paternal grandfather died 
    at Ilesha, and I followed my parents to their trading village in 
    Ojoku. When later I came to know that I was born in 1918, I 
    concluded that my grandfather died in 1922 and that I also came to 
    Ojoku in 1922. And I also guessed my cousin Afolabi was born at 
    Ilesha in the same year 1922.
At Ojoku my father and mother were engaged in the Osomalo 
    business. Periodically Father would travel to Lagos by train taking 
    with him a wagon load of yams which he would sell there. With the 
    money realised from the sale he would buy several bales of 
    different kinds of cloth which he would bring back by train to 
    Apata Aje the nearest station to Ojoku. These he and mother sold in 
    Ojoku and the surrounding villages. Since the village man or woman 
    could not afford to purchase on the basis of immediate cash 
    payment, he or she readily agreed to buy on credit involving 
    repayment by monthly 
    installments. But the Osomalo was usually before the 
    stipulated time, back asking to be paid his money and vowing never 
    to sit nor to stand but to squat down on his legs till he was paid 
    his debt. The debtor dared not complain to the police of Osomalo 
    harassment because for a little bribe the police was sure to side 
    with the Osomalo and cause further and harsher harassment to the 
    debtor.
Mother prepared a quick breakfast for the family and quickly 
    disappeared on her round of the adjoining villages with her bale of 
    cloths. My father at the same time went to his own group of 
    villages. So the two of them went on their business, leaving me, 
    their four year old son, to take care of myself as best as I could 
    till they returned for mother to prepare a meal in the evening. I 
    am probably doing my parents a disservice now in reporting that 
    they did not take enough care of me. My four year old mind probably 
    forgot what good arrangement they provided for me but stored up 
    only the hunger before they arrived back in the evening. Also I 
    might have been five and not four and was thought to be more able 
    to look after myself than a four year old. In any case in the 
    company of village kids I soon learnt bad habits, like pilfering 
    coins from under my mother's mat and buying groundnuts with 
    the loot.
A few years before she died my mother visited me and my wife 
    Bisi in Lagos and told us this story of my days in Ojoku. I had 
    gone to buy groundnuts with a coin of denomination very much higher 
    than a child could legitimately come by. The groundnut woman 
    suspected that I must have stolen it, probably from my mother, 
    accepted the coin and gave me a parcel of groundnuts. She then 
    followed me to my mother. She explained to her what had happened 
    and returned the coin to my grateful mother.
As I grew older I also grew wilder. Father brought for me from 
    Lagos a copy of the Yoruba primer called ABD, the first three 
    letters of the Yoruba alphabet. He himself tried to teach me. He 
    aIso made me promise to learn it instead of following the village 
    urchins when he and mother had gone to sell textiles in the 
    villages, but after the newness had worn off I threw the new book 
    aside to follow my fellow urchins. No amount of thrashing from my 
    father and sobbing from my mother would make me change my ways.
My parents were horrified to learn after returning from their 
    rounds one evening of my involvement with the Eshu Shrine. There 
    was an Eshu Shrine in nearly every household in Ojoku, and at each 
    Shrine was palm oil, cowries and onini coins. Our gang would go to 
    a house when the occupants were not in and steal the oninis and the 
    cowries, wipe the food remnants and oil from them, and would go 
    round the corner to buy groundnuts with the apparently lean money. 
    The groundnut seller did not suspect the source of our money. If 
    she did she would have fainted!
My father gave me a thorough beating which made my mother cry 
    ever so much. I really did not see what distressed them so much 
    about me. In their wisdom they decided that I must leave Ojoku 
    before I grew to become a perfect vagabond. I could not go back to 
    Ilesha because they thought my grandmother Oni Eleran would be 
    unable to cope with me. My mother came out with the answer. In her 
    father's village, Oko-Igbo, there was a Village teacher cum 
    Catechist who lived in her father's compound. They would send 
    me to him at Oko-Igbo and he would knock some sense into my little 
    head.
The next phase of my childhood started therefore with the 
    village Teacher at Oko Igbo, a village near Ilesha. Subsequent 
    events made me think that the year was 1924, not 1923. You see I 
    was very young then and I knew no nothing about dates.
The Village Teacher, who I came to know as Funlayo, lived with 
    his nephew Folayan in two of the many rooms in the compound of my 
    maternal grandfather, Ademoroti Sonibare. Here my 
    grandfather's children, some married and some unmarried, and 
    other relatives, lived in a large household into which Funlayo the 
    outsider fitted fairly well. He was a teacher about sixteen to 
    eighteen years old. His nephew Folayan was some three years older 
    than I. The arrival of my goodself was easily managed by my 
    doubling with Folayan in one of the two rooms at night.

    SOME NIGERIAN CRYSTALLINE BASEMENT COMPLEX ROCKS
INTRODUCTION
The main difficulty in the direct measurement of the electrical 
    resistivity of crystalline basement rocks is in making good 
    electrical contact with the rock outcrop. For this reason, the 
    resistivity is conventionally inferred from the interpretation of 
    sounding data where invariably the bedrock is overlain by regolith, 
    with the attendant loss of resolution due to suppression. The 
    resistivity of the substratum so determined can hardly be precise, 
    especially when the geoelectrical unit directly overlying it has a 
    very low resistivity. In many cases, a somewhat ambiguous and 
    ill-defined „infinite“ resistivity is then assigned to the bedrock 
    (Verma et al., 1980; Beeson and Jones, 1988; Olayinka, 1990; 
    Olorunfemi et al., 1991; Hazell et al., 1992). An 
    alternative approach is to measure the resistivity of the rock in 
    the laboratory.
In the present work, the electrical resistivity of some Pre- 
    Cambrian to Upper Cambrian crystalline basement rock units from 
    southwestern Nigeria, has been measured in the laboratory. The 
    relevant theory is due to Van der Pauw (1958) who derived an 
    analytic expression for the specific electrical resistivity of a 
    material bounded by a simply connected arbitrary shaped closed 
    curve containing no singularities. The expression is in terms of 
    currents and potential differences measured at the boundary of the 
    curve. Four electrodes are used and the rock specimens do not have 
    to take any regular shape, although a uniform thickness must be 
    ensured. Electrical contact is made with the sample by injecting 
    the filter tip of the electrode with 0.1 molar potassium 
    chloride solution.
The resistivity of 102 rock samples comprising quartzites, 
    gneisses, charnockite, amphibolite, biotite granite and 
    granodiorite from 5 locations in southwestern Nigeria, was 
    measured. The results show that, in general, the basement rocks 
    have very high resistivities, ranging from 1.01 * 
    103 to 2.82 * 
    106 ohm-m. The gneisses have the lowest 
    resistivities; followed by banded gneiss; augen gneiss; biotite 
    granite; charnockite; granodiorite; amphibolite; while quartzite 
    has the highest.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
Determination of the specific resistivity of samples with 
    arbitrary shapes requires measurement of the potentials and current 
    flows at the boundary of the samples. To carry out this, contacts 
    with the samples must be at the circumference and must have areas 
    that are small compared with the surface area of the sample. This 
    condition is met by the use of special electrochemical electrodes 
    employing silver and chloride ions. Moreover, the sample must have 
    uniform thickness and should not contain any isolated holes. This 
    condition is fulfilled by slicing the sample twice, the first cut 
    being to create a reference surface and the second to complete the 
    slice.
If 1, 2, 3, 4 are small cyclic contacts at the circumference of 
    the arbitrarily shaped uniform thick slice, the following 
    resistances can be defined :

where V, I denote the potential at and the current through the 
    specified nodes or branches, respectively.
R12,34 = R34,12 
    and R23,41 = R41,23 
    by the reciprocity relation derivable from Telegen’s theorem for a 
    two-port electrical network (Agunloye and Hussain, 1982).
Van der Pauw (1958) has shown that the specific resistivity of a 
    specimen under the above condition is 
    :

where X = natural logarithm of 2.0; d = thickness of the 
    sample and f is a function of ε given by

The electrical measuring system (Fig. 1) consists of a 
    current source, current adjuster, selector, data precision model 
    1350 digital multi-meter and four non-polarisable silver-silver 
    chloride electrodes. A sheet of fine silver mesh, 30 * 20 mm, is 
    cut, with any dirts on its surface removed using emery. A solution 
    of 1 molar HCl is prepared and the silver mesh dropped into it. 
    This is left for seven days after which a proper and permanent 
    coated sheet is obtained. This sheet is rolled up into a 
    cylindrical electrode, 30 mm long and 3 * 
    10-5 square metre cross-sectional area 
    with about 2 to 3 mm of filter paper at the free end. Apart from 
    the fact that the silver-silver chloride electrode obtained this 
    way is very reliable and lasts long, it also helps to minimise the 
    effects of electrode impedance. The only disadvantage is the fairly 
    long time the preparation takes.
A rock sample is cut into uniformly thick slice with the aid of 
    a powerful electrical cutting machine and its thickness measured 
    using a micrometer screw gauge. The electrodes are set up on 
    various positions on the boundary of the sample to represent 
    irregular electrode configurations. They are mounted on the rock by 
    affixing them in holes made in an insulating plate cut in the shape 
    of the sample. The plate is then clamped in such a way that the 
    electrode filter tips rest on the edge of the sample. Electrical 
    contact is made with sample by injecting the filter paper with 
    0.1 molar KCl solution. The insulating plate thus acts as a 
    socket for the electrodes.
The current source whose output could be varied by a separate 
    current adjuster provides current at two terminals on the selector. 
    This selector ensures that once the electrodes are affixed on the 
    sample the cyclic permutation of electrode function could be made 
    by the use of the selector gear without transferring the contacts 
    on the sample. The voltage-current measurement is done using two 
    digital multimeters of the same type. One multimeter measures 
    current and the other measures the voltage. The potentials and 
    currents corresponding to the four cyclic permutations of positions 
    1, 2, 3 and 4 on the rock sample are measured for the five boundary 
    arrays. Resistances R12,34 and 
    R23,41 are calculated and the specific 
    resistivity of each sample determined from the Van der Pauw 
    equation. The only precaution made was to ensure that the 
    preliminary drying and soaking processes allowed reproduction of 
    results.
One hundred and two rock samples were used for this experiment 
    and they comprised various crystalline basement units from 
    southwestern Nigeria. The localities from which the samples were 
    collected are shown in Fig. 2. The rock types include 
    gneisses, quartzite, amphibolite, biotite granite, granodiorite, 
    and charnockite. The results obtained are presented in the 
    following section.
RESULTS
The results indicate a wide overlap in the resistivities of the 
    various rock types (Table 1). This shows that the resistivity of a 
    rock sample is not diagnostic of its lithology.
Nonetheless, it is obvious that the gneisses have the lowest 
    resistivities, followed by biotite granite, granodiorite, 
    charnockite, amphibolite and quartzite. The range, mean and 
    standard deviation of the resistivities of the respective rock 
    types are presented in Table 1.

Most of the gneiss samples have resistivities less than 7000 
    ohm-m while only 8% have resistivities higher than 9000 ohm-m 
    (Fig. 4a). The mean is 4739 ± 3149 ohm-m. The samples with 
    low resistivities (less than 3000 ohm-m) may characterize fractured 
    basement rocks while those with higher values are probably 
    indicative of unfractured bedrock. The biotite granite samples have 
    resistivities ranging between 8020 and 62 000 ohm-m. It may be 
    noted that 40% of these samples have resistivities in the range 20 
    000 to 30 000 ohm-m (Fig. 4b). The quartzites have the 
    highest resistivities, varying between 50 600 and 2 820 000 ohm-m, 
    although about 77% of those samples have resistivities less than 
    106 ohm-m.
It has been observed that even for the same rock exposure there 
    may be a wide range of resistivities for different samples. An 
    example of this was recorded from Osuntedo where 10 samples of 
    charnockite were collected from different parts of the same 
    outcrop. There is a wide disparity between the lowest (20 900 
    ohm-m) and the highest (175 000 ohm-m), this being a ratio of 
    8.37. In particular, the mean resistivity is 54 500 ohm-m 
    while the standard deviation is 44 000 ohm-m, giving a high 
    coefficient of variation of 81%. This is indicative of a high 
    degree of dispersion, which may be attributed to differences in 
    mineralogy at the respective portions of the exposure.
For a given rock type it is to be expected that there will also 
    be variations in resistivity from one locality to another. It has 
    been found out, for instance, that the Ayete quartzite samples have 
    lower mean resistivities (156 000 ± 154 000 ohm-m) than those from 
    Mokola, Ibadan (429 000 ± 273 000 ohm-m) while those from the 
    University of Ibadan Campus have the highest at 2 260 000 ± 395 000 
    ohm-m. Similarly, the mean resistivities of biotite granite from 
    Idere (29 600 ± 6 000 ohm-m) are lower than those from Tapa (30 200 
    ± 20 000 ohm-m) and Ayete (36 300 ± 9 600 ohm-m). These variations 
    may also be explained by differences in mineralogy.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a laboratory method has been used to measure the 
    electrical resistivity of fresh samples of arbitrarily shaped 
    samples of fresh crystalline basement rocks from southwestern 
    Nigeria. The results indicate that these rocks have very high 
    resistivities, ranging from about 1000 ohm-m to nearly 3 * 
    106 ohm-m. This is in agreement with 
    previous work. The granite gneisses samples have the lowest 
    resistivities, followed by banded gneiss, augen gneiss, biotite 
    granite, charnockite, granodiorite, amphibolite and quartzite. In 
    each case, there are large standard deviations of the mean 
    resistivity. One implication of these high resistivities is that 
    the rocks have very low porosity and very low water content.
A comparison of the results with those earlier reported for the 
    resistivity of fresh crystalline basement rocks from parts of 
    Nigeria and other parts of Africa (Table 2) shows a broad agreement 
    with the present work.
There is, in general, some correlation between the electrical 
    resistivity of the various rock types and their susceptibility to 
    chemical weathering. This may have some relationship with the 
    temperature of formation of the constituent minerals. For example, 
    quartzite (comprising largely of quartz) is a low temperature rock; 
    it has a very high resistivity and hence does not weather readily. 
    In most instances, quartzites are overlain by a fairly shallow 
    weathering profile, and stand up prominently as ridges. On the 
    other hand, the gneisses are characterised by lineations which 
    constitute planes of weaknesses and consequently show relatively 
    lower resistivities and weather more readily. Hence, gneisses are 
    often overlain by a very thick weathered mantle (Barker et al., 1992). Although granites contain similar amounts of feldspars 
    and ferromagnesian minerals as gneisses, in the former rock type 
    the minerals are not continuously linked even though the feldspars 
    in the granites may occur in megacrysts (David, 1988). It may be 
    pointed out that granite has a higher resistivity than the 
    gneisses, and is also less susceptible to attack by agents of 
    chemical weathering.
It is envisaged that the experimental data obtained in this 
    research would provide complementary information to those obtained 
    from sounding interpretation and subsequently extended to fractured 
    basement rocks.

A peculiar responsibility of anyone charged with the management 
    of university education in Nigeria or anywhere, for that matter, is 
    the awesome task of managing an enormous pool of human resource. 
    The true quality of a university is determined by the calibre of 
    staff, both academic and non-academic, that it has. The university 
    is a place of learning, of scholarship where the highest standards 
    are expected. At the best of times the staff, especially academic 
    staff, are supposed to be inspired by the greatest ideals of 
    scholarship and conduct. This comes about when they are motivated 
    by the provision of equipment and facilities to work with and when 
    they are paid wages that enable them to concentrate all their 
    energies on teaching and research. Unfortunately, this has not been 
    the situation in Nigeria in the last two decades. The 
    scabrious environment and inadequate salaries have led to 
    the brain-drain syndrome. But a more deadly effect of the situation 
    has been the almost complete breakdown of moral consciousness and 
    adherence to the ideals of the teaching profession. Much of what 
    passes for normal university culture has disappeared and there is a 
    frightening degree of delinquency among staff.
The need to re-direct staff, to coax and cajole them back to the 
    primary vision and mission of the university is one of the grave 
    duties of the manager of university education at this time. The 
    temptation to make quick and easy money by exploiting students has 
    diverted the attention of many academic staff from research. Even 
    in difficult times, our universities must strive to remain at the 
    cutting edge of knowledge, to create and contribute new knowledge. 
    University education should be so managed to ensure that good 
    quality teaching is going on and equipment for research provided. 
    These are the raison d'etre of 
    universities.
To facilitate this attempt to keep in the fore quality research 
    and familiarity with current scholarship, Nigerian universities 
    should take the establishment of linkages and exchange programmes 
    with African and overseas universities seriously. Any university 
    that is out of date is dead. The area of the provision and 
    maintenance of good academic staff desires critical attention as 
    attempts are made to reposition our universities for proper 
    performance. The fact that academics is no longer the first choice 
    of many bright undergraduates and many of the lecturers now are 
    only secondarily interested in teaching and research, should be 
    cause for worry.
The area of the relationship between the staff and the 
    management is delicate and should be the business of the manager. 
    University staff are outspoken, know their rights, are aware of the 
    rules and insist on conscientious welfare packages. While 
    management must ensure that there is discipline and that staff 
    perform their duties, the leadership of the university should run 
    an open administration with which everyone can identify. Some of 
    the tensions that plague our universities result from preferential 
    treatments given to some members of staff where the leadership is 
    unable to be even-handed and fair.
Students
Students represent the largest segment of the university 
    community. They are partly the reason for the establishment of 
    universities and their fortune in the university is part of the 
    litmus test for good management of university education. They are 
    vulnerable, they are the recipients of the education offered in the 
    institutions and their quality partly determines the success or 
    failure of the system. They are also extremely impressionistic, 
    critical and problematic and malleable; good student management is 
    part of the question of the vision of the university. One sad 
    aspect of student management in the campus is the belief among the 
    radical and activist few that students must confront the 
    administration and that the only way they can make their presence 
    felt is by causing crises and disrupting the orderly running of 
    sessions. Good university management would recognise this tendency 
    and devise strategies to repudiate such culture and tradition.
Students seem to suffer the decay in the system in some very 
    special ways, right from when they are admitted into the university 
    to the end of their programmes. For many of them, their first 
    experience of a university during their admission is not of a place 
    inhabited by gods who are upright and decent, but clay-footed and 
    corrupt individuals who extort money from them before they are 
    admitted. No good university management should tolerate this 
    unhealthy situation. Admission scores introduce distortions that 
    must be removed from university education. Some of the violence and 
    frustration the students exhibit in their demonstrations can be 
    traced to the perceived injustice they experience.
In this connection, government's admission policy is faulty 
    and needs to be reviewed. The recent re-definition of catchment 
    areas which officially encourages the concentration of people from 
    certain tribal groups in different universities promotes ethnicity 
    and defeats one of the missions of the university - to promote 
    national unity through a citizenry liberated by education. Many 
    candidates who are prima-facie qualified for 
    admission lose out because they come from outside certain 
    geographical zones. If this policy must be maintained, it will be 
    advisable to increase the percentage reserved for candidates 
    admitted on merit to fifty per cent (50%) of the total number that 
    applied for a particular course and the other prescribed 
    permutations for admission used for the rest. But it is, perhaps, 
    best to loosen the stranglehold of the Joint Admission and 
    Matriculation Board. JAMB should not be involved in admissions 
    per se. The results of the University 
    Matriculation Exams should be a guide to individual universities in 
    making their choice of candidates. And universities may decide to 
    adopt additional steps to ensure that they get the calibre of 
    students they want. Such a step will also save JAMB some of the 
    unsavoury criticisms that have been levelled against it of late, 
    especially the allegation that the performances of some 
    high-scoring candidates in the UME bear absolutely no relationship 
    to the capabilities they demonstrate in class on admission. The 
    idea of catchment areas should be reviewed even if priorities are 
    going to be made for some groups.
A disheartening feature of Nigerian universities and the despair 
    of most managers of our universities in the last two decades has 
    been the high degree of indiscipline among university students. 
    Apart from the fact that students have active and inquiring minds, 
    have high expectations that can be easily disappointed, they are 
    generally impatient, at times irritating and enjoy letting off 
    steam before they realise the amount of damage they have caused. In 
    some cases, they are also instigated by mischievous members of 
    staff and some political forces outside. All these lead to 
    situations of disorder that often cause harm, even death, and the 
    frequent closures of our universities. For the manager of the 
    university, this is one of the most unwelcome experiences because 
    it means the students are out of school for several months and do 
    not get the education they should.
The most harrowing indication of the breakdown of discipline in 
    our unwillingness is the demonic feature of cults and cultism on 
    almost every campus. At the last count, there were more than forty 
    cult groups among both men and women in our university system. And 
    reports show that they have also spread to the secondary schools. 
    Several historical and sociological studies have been made of this 
    menace in attempts to understand and stamp out the evil. Over and 
    above all the brilliant suggestions that have been made, it seems 
    clear to the present writer that the main problem can be located in 
    the breakdown of moral order and the erosion of the essential 
    culture of the university: the pursuit of truth, the sense of right 
    and wrong, adhesion to civilised and decent ways, devotion to 
    scholarship and research at different levels, development of 
    potentials in sports and the arts, community service, interest in 
    mental and spiritual development, and innocent fun. If our 
    universities were seen as communities where certain practices were 
    forbidden by the sheer force of their traditions and were stamped 
    out as soon as they reared their heads - barring interference from 
    outside - cultism would have been contained. The operation of cults 
    on campuses do not provide the right condition for learning. To 
    improve discipline among students, three important steps need to be 
    taken: attention to student welfare, serious counselling of 
    students and a lifting of the moral tone of the universities. 
    Students should be made to understand that as adults they are fully 
    responsible for their action and the law would take its full course 
    in cases of infraction. In this regard one of the worst syndromes 
    that has polluted university education here is the sickness of 
    examination malpractices. They betray not only the moral vacuity of 
    our students and the denigration of the most important aspect of 
    their training but also their lack of confidence in the university. 
    This problem must be eliminated in our universities.
Finally, it is possible that one of the reasons for the 
    persistence of almost identical forms of violence and cultism in 
    our universities to the complete negation of what true university 
    education stands for, is the insularity of our situation. In spite 
    of the explosion in the information market, few of our students 
    seem to know what their counterparts in other parts of the world 
    are doing, their concerns and their view of education for 
    sustainable development. To complement what little our students get 
    from the clamorous, programmes should be devised that enable them 
    travel to other universities outside the country either on short 
    term visits or on exchange programmes. The importance of travel as 
    part of education has always been recognised, and now that our 
    system here seems to have been so polluted, such a tonic will help 
    to rejuvenate and re-direct our university communities as we seek 
    to pull them back from the brink of disaster. In Europe the ERASMUS 
    and SOCRATES groups are popular travel bands of students and the 
    experiences they acquire not only encourage comparison and 
    cross-fertilisation of ideas but lead to richer personal 
    development.
The Unions
The revolutions in labour relation matters of the seventies and 
    eighties impacted significantly on the nation's universities. 
    Hitherto, full-blown unionism was anathema to the universities. 
    However, with the new trend in the country and in the spirit of 
    democracy, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) was 
    granted the full status of a trade union to protect the interest of 
    academic staff of Nigerian universities. Thereafter, the 
    non-academic staff also organised themselves into the Senior Staff 
    Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic 
    Staff Union (NASU) as pressure groups in the university. The 
    students have always had the National Association of Nigerian 
    Students (NANS) and students unions in individual universities. 
    These local unions have now been elevated to the status of 
    governments and prefer to be known as Student Union Government 
    (SUG). The striking point about the existence of these staff unions 
    on campus is that they are national bodies only represented by 
    chapters in the various universities. The implication of this 
    structure is that the unions owe their allegiance elsewhere outside 
    their parent universities. University administrations have to 
    contend with the harrowing pressures from the local branches and 
    directives from the national headquarters of the various unions.
This thumb-nail account of the unions on our university campus 
    immediately alerts any reader to the nightmare which their various 
    demands and activities constitute to the university management. 
    Indeed, Vice-Chancellors are the only Chief Executive Officers who 
    have to contend with such a large number of labour unions in any 
    organisation. The ability of a Vice-Chancellor to manage his 
    unions, assuage their intemperance, keep his university open 
    throughout the session and provide a peaceful learning environment 
    is certainly an index of his leadership ability and determination 
    that our universities should concentrate on their primary 
    assignments of teaching and research. The unions' protest area 
    cover a wide range of perceived grievances; some serious, others 
    trivial and still others plainly mischievous. Some of the unions 
    have become tools in the hands of disreputable staff union leaders 
    who merely use them to create problems for the administration.

We Nigerians are a different set of people. We just love 
    flamboyance. It is amazing. Every one wants to look good. We all 
    know it is alright to look good. Everyone wants to live and look 
    like a Hollywood star.
There is no problem with that. But the question is, does 
    everyone earn what a Hollywood star earns? Really when a person has 
    to borrow money to look good, it becomes a problem. For us, looking 
    good starts with the house we live in, the car we drive, the clubs 
    we go to, the people we hang out with, the shoes we wear and the 
    whole works. Think about it.
If a person has to borrow to fulfill those obligations as the 
    case may be, then there is a problem. We are not talking about food 
    or clothing to cover ones body here. We are talking of extreme 
    vanity. Too many people are in debt and problems unnecessarily. We 
    really all have to sit back. Reflect and change our mind set.
Listen to me!!! You are here to fulfill your destiny. It is not 
    tied to any other persons destiny. You are not in competition with 
    any one. Your focus must be on living well. Believe me, living well 
    is possible. Living well is not supposed to be stressful if we all 
    learn to “cut our coat according to the cloth we have"" 
     What I am saying essentially is that you 
    live within your means.
We are all agreed that everyone can make a living. Come on now, 
    even an artisan in Nigeria earns at east two thousand naira 
    everyday , and labor is at least one thousand naira everyday. We 
    have already established the fact that every one can work. There is 
    something everyone can do to make money if you are not 
    condescending. The problem we have is that everyone wants to start 
    of big.
Your neighbor or friend is a ‘big boy’ or ‘big girl’ as the case may be, 
    and you want to kill yourself. You do not even know the price 
    he/she had to pay to get to where they are.
Many people really have enough to do what they need to do, but 
    they think they must do it bigger so they can show off for all to 
    see. Really!!! Who cares !
We all need to change our mindset. We all must realize that in 
    this world, you are not in competition with anyone. It is so sad. 
    Many people want to wear Ferragamo shoes, Rolex or Cartier watches, 
    drive the latest BMW, live in Park view estate and Ikoyi. There is 
    nothing wrong with all these things if you can really afford 
    them.
You must use what you have to get what you really need. You need 
    shoes, buy shoes. You need a wrist watch, there are so many 
    functional wristwatches. If you can afford to pay your rent 
    anywhere every month for the rest of your life without having to 
    borrow any money from anyone, you are living good. You are on 
    top.
Too many people need to buy a car. They know they have enough 
    for a Pinto, but they must buy a Passat. What is wrong with us. 
    That you can buy a Pinto and maintain it, is a lot of Grace. There 
    is a way you step into a Pinto, that would even make the owner of a 
    ferreri envious.
Be happy. It is all about contentment. This woman bought a 
    beetle in those days, and when she was telling her mum, she said”I 
    just bought a car, but its only a beetle 
    o” Or this couple who just moved into their apartment, and 
    the wife was telling her friend. “Finally, we found a place. But 
    it’s just a one bedroom apartment” Who 
    cares!!! The stress is all yours.
Everyone has their life to live. Live yours. With what you have, 
    you can live well. It is a mindset. It is all about contentment.
What I am saying is not that you should be complacent. There is 
    always a place for growth. You can only be where you are at any 
    point in time. If point A is where you are now, be realistic. Yes, 
    you are aspiring to get to point B, but what point A has to offer, 
    receive it and enjoy it with thanksgiving. When you do get to point 
    B, you can step up into what point B has it offer.
That point A that you are at now, and you do not appreciate is 
    someone else’s aspiration. Be happy. Be content.
I visited this African country last weekend, and I think they 
    are worth learning from. When things were bad for them, they left 
    their country, and came over to Nigeria, and did every available 
    odd job that was available at the time, and when things took a 
    better turn for their country, they went back and they are enjoying 
    it.
Now you see most of them with small functional cars that can 
    take them from point A to B. Many live in small houses. I am not 
    saying that they don’t have their own minuses, but they are happy 
    people. I see them as people making the best of what they have.
They have discovered oil now, I know when oil money comes, they 
    would adapt to the good life and start spending oil money. 
    Contentment is key. Don’t kill yourself. It is your life. Live for 
    yourself.

It still feels a little strange to be writing to you 
    posthumously and in such a public place but I am getting used to 
    this - our personal will always be political. But what I find so 
    reassuring is that we can still communicate, and whenever we talk 
    the great puzzle that is Ken Saro-Wiwa becomes a little clearer. 
    Ken Saro-Wiwa has many important components but your letters, your 
    books, the insights and the values they contain makes the job that 
    little bit easier.
For sure, it is a politically charged legacy but not the least 
    of it for me is the very personal need to finally lay your body to 
    rest. I guess you knew that when you wrote: On the Death 
    of Ken Saro-Wiwa and predicted that the goons would deny 
    you 'six feet of earth'. I think more people should read 
    you because your words, your life and death are pregnant with so 
    much political meaning and have so often proved to be eerily 
    prophetic.
Your death should, in retrospect, have been a salutary lesson in 
    what happens when corporations rule our world; but few people 
    really understood the significance of what happened on 10th 
    November 1995 - The Times described your 
    execution as a 'cautionary tale of the 20th century' and 
    your friend, Chuks Illoegbunam, posed and answered his own question 
    in the London Guardian: 'what does Ken 
    Saro-Wiwa's death mean? It means nothing has changed.'
On reflection, I think Chuks' observation was actually a 
    challenge; to his readers, to everyone who felt profoundly uneasy 
    that a writer, who had prosecuted a just environmental cause on a 
    non-violent platform, could be met with the indifference and 
    hostility of a military dictatorship and a multinational, be 
    sentenced to death by an illegally constituted court and then 
    hanged before a world audience, despite international and 
    diplomatic pleas for his life.
Ten years have passed and, despite all the public outrage and 
    grief, it appears that the world hasn't learned anything from 
    your death: we still live in a world where corporations rank 
    profits well above their value to people and the planet. Our world 
    remains one in which corporations can, and do, routinely get away 
    with murder.
In our small way we continue to try to make them accountable - 
    you will be happy to know that we did manage to bring a suit 
    against Shell in the US for their role in your arrest, detention, 
    trial and execution. They have been charged under the provisions of 
    the Alien Torts Claims Act, the Torture Victim Protection Act, and 
    the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations (RICO) Act. And 
    the case will, if nothing else, fulfil your prediction that 
    'Shell is here on trial. The company has, indeed, ducked this 
    particular trial, but its day will surely come.'
Your prediction was uppermost in my mind when the Centre for 
    Constitutional Rights advised that I could bring the multinational 
    to court in the US for their role in your murder. But it has taken 
    eight years of judicial arguments for the US courts to declare that 
    Shell has a case to answer for their role in your murder.
All this legal to-ing and fro-ing reminds me of when you had 
    high hopes that I would pursue a career in law. You know I resisted 
    you for all kinds of reasons, but fundamentally I always thought it 
    was too stereotypical of what every African wants for their 
    children. I wanted to use my imagination but ,having seen and 
    better understood what happened to our people and to you, I now 
    understand that a creative project for an African requires the 
    imaginative use of every tool at our disposal - from business to 
    science to art and to, of course, the law to free us from our 
    predicament.
Our complaint against Shell was filed in 1996. It accuses them 
    of crimes against humanity, torture, summary execution, arbitrary 
    detention, and racketeering, alleging that their actions in Nigeria 
    violate the provisions of the Alien Tort Claims Act.
It took six years of legal arguments and appeals, chiefly over 
    jurisdiction, before Judge Kimba Wood declared in our favour on 28 
    February 2002, acknowledging that there was sufficient evidence of 
    collusion between Shell and the Nigerian military to qualify as 
    racketeering under the RICO Act.
As I write, the case has just finished the discovery stage and, 
    from what I have observed, it seems Shell is more concerned about 
    procedure and technicalities than the substantive allegations. It 
    is sickening that a company with such resources, that is in a 
    'win-win' situation in Nigeria - an organisation that has 
    earned billions from our land - remains unwilling to take 
    responsibility for its actions and is trying to portray itself as 
    an innocent bystander and even victim of unscrupulous, black 
    Africans. Poor little rich Shell!
What really sticks in the craw is that last year they were found 
    guilty of misrepresenting then- proven 
    reserves by as much as four billion barrels - in effect, selling a 
    false prospectus to shareholders. You won't be surprised that 
    much of the scandal happened within Shell's Nigerian 
    subsidiary. When the Chairman of Shell International, Sir Philip 
    Watts, -yes the same Philip Watts who was in charge of Shell 
    Nigeria when they had you locked you up - resigned or was sacked 
    (with a six figure bonus for his sins). The New York stock exchange 
    responded swiftly and fined Shell. And, within a few days of the 
    scandal breaking, those who had bought Shell stock on a false 
    prospectus were busy firing lawsuits against the company. The 
    market moves swiftly to protect investors yet when the same 
    organization violates human rights and destroys the environment, it 
    can take a generation to get redress.
That's the world your grandchildren will grow up in, and 
    there are times when I think it is better you left this world 
    behind. But it could have been so different couldn't it?
I remember how excited you were when the Berlin Wall came down 
    in 1989. I remember you saw it as an opportunity for our people 
    finally to stand up for our rights because the world was 
    encouraging minorities, especially in Eastern Europe, to stand up 
    for theirs. You wrote that if it was good for the former countries 
    of the Soviet Union, it was surely good for communities like the 
    Ogoni. Trapped in post-colonial nation-states that cheated 
    minorities like the Ogoni of our right to self-determination, no 
    longer would African people be treated as strategic pawns in Cold 
    War chess games, and we would benefit from the so-called peace 
    dividend.
I remember those days too: it was a time when environmental 
    awareness was high on the public agenda in the West, and the Second 
    Earth Summit in Rio confirmed that a critical mass was building 
    behind a desire to build a kinder, gentler world. Capitalism had 
    overcome socialism and some people were even suggesting it was the 
    end of history.
Imagine that ten years after the triumphalism of the West, we 
    had apparently squandered the peace dividend, and there were 
    anti-capitalism riots in Seattle, and the newspapers were full of 
    headlines like 'capitalism in crisis'.
When I ask myself what went wrong, I think back to your murder, 
    coming as it did in between the collapse of the Soviet Union and 
    the Seattle riots. Looking back, your killing merely proved that 
    unrestrained capitalism did not deliver higher standards of living 
    for everyone, but actually contributed to greater inequalities of 
    wealth, attendant public disorder and greater levels of human 
    insecurity. The first Gulf War (1991) had already indicated that 
    the New World Order was not new but reactionary; one that would go 
    to any lengths to eliminate anything or anyone who threatened the 
    status quo in the supply of energy. Your murder 
    merely ratified that the old world order was still very much in 
    business.
The brazenness of your death tempered the advance and spawned a 
    new guilt industry - Corporate Social Responsibility. The notion 
    that, left to their own devices, corporations will act as good 
    corporate citizens, is an interesting one, not least because while 
    CSR was being loudly trumpeted, expensively advertised and propped 
    up by an artifice of voluntary codes and offered as a sap to its 
    critics, corporations were busy showing their true hand by working 
    through GATT negotiations, trying to install the Multilateral 
    Agreement on Investment (MAI) and, subsequently, through the 
    undemocratic offices of the WTO.
The corporate agenda has a bewildering array of blunt 
    international instruments, organisations and scholarship to advance 
    and promote its cause. And yet, despite their supposedly good 
    intentions expressed in the form of scholarships, grants, 
    foundations and other PR activities, the world gets poorer as they 
    pursue their real objectives: ever greater corporate wealth while 
    the gap between the rich and poor is widening, wealth is being 
    concentrated in ever-decreasing circles by the dictates of a 
    commercial agenda that is self-serving and socially divisive.
Right now, we are in the middle of yet another expensive and 
    troubling conflict in the Gulf. Lives are being lost daily in Iraq, 
    which has been occupied on the pretext of something called the 
    'axis of evil' - a phrase which most people are now 
    slowly coming to realise is really about access to oil. Because, 
    since George Bush came to power - no, not the father but the son - 
    the top five companies in the US have made $250 billion in clear 
    profits. Imagine that - all the while the US has racked up record 
    deficits to fight something called the 'War on 
    Terrorism'. I won't bore you with the connections between 
    Iraq and the War on Terrorism, but the shorthand of it goes 
    something like this: 9-11= oil.

NigerianEnglish,could,But before he could settle in the country was thrown into conflict,dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,PHum_20,"War Child: A Novel by Bruce Cerew
Upon witnessing the explosion its creators had mixed reactions. 
    However one thing was certain, they had ushered in a new dimension 
    to war and the equilibrium in our existence. ""I am 
    become Death, the destroyer of worlds"" Cried Robert 
    Oppenheimer as he watched the mushroom cloud of radioactive vapour 
    rise into the cloud, leaving only fragments of jade green 
    radioactive glass in the soil and a horrendous weapon of war for 
    mankind.
The history of mankind is a tale of an endless episode of 
    violence, death, bloodshed and the misery all in the name of war. 
    In spite of these harsh realities mankind continues to be plagued 
    by this terror. Benjamin Franklin once said, “There never 
    was a good war or a bad peace” yet sadly we are forced to 
    hear and see the frightening images of innocent men, women and 
    children who have been murdered, maimed, raped, tortured and 
    scarred by conflicts in their localities.
Driven by the will to survive, the victims are forced to flee 
    their homes and seek refuge in the indignity of life as 
    a hopeless nomads and refugees. In the process they attempt 
    to cross paths strewn with perils, despair and hopelessness; many 
    perish, some fall prey to uncertainty and many never have another 
    shot at the better life they desperately seek. Yet the fortunate 
    few that brave the hazardous circumstances end up in the chains of 
    destitution, discrimination and under the constant shadow of fears 
    in cities of the Western nations.
The ‘’War Child’’ by Bruce Cerew is a book that chronicles the 
    tales of war; as seen through the eye of a boy, Ray, its 
    protagonist and victim of horrors of the conflicts in Sierra Leone 
    and Liberia. The book paints a true picture of the plight of 
    refugees and the horrors they are so atrociously forced upon by 
    lending credence to the voices of the maimed men, women, and 
    children scarred and ravaged by war.
The 318 page “War Child” is written as a narrative and employs a 
    simple diction to tell its story. It is a tale of humor and 
    tragedy, courage and fear, hopelessness and anticipation, love and 
    betrayal, hope and triumph. “War Child” in set in Nigeria, Sierra 
    Leone, Liberia and the Netherlands.
The book begins with Ray’s struggles in life beginning from an 
    early age in Eastern Nigeria. The young Ray was constantly abused 
    by his father (a compulsive gambler and an alcoholic) who could not 
    come to terms with the boy’s inadequacies. Ray was thus sent away 
    to the village of Amata to live with his grandmother. There Ray 
    finds love, fear and mysterious character in whom he suddenly finds 
    a friend and comforter.
Now grown the boy Ray puts aside childhood traumas and 
    insecurities returns to the city in search of a livelihood. But his 
    hallucinations reappeared handing him the feeling of emptiness and 
    his fears and delusions.
In search of greener pastures away from hassles of life in 
    Nigeria, Ray emigrates to Monrovia. But before he could settle in 
    the country was thrown into conflict. The war ushered in a time of 
    bloodshed, death, sorrow and anguish. Ray forced to flee to 
    Freetown, Sierra Leone in the hope for a life away from the misery 
    of carnage in Liberia. But yet again the gates of Hell were cast 
    open.
The second part of “War Child” begins Ray’s eventual flight to 
    the Netherlands where Ray meets Jamo and Bar. The plot in the tale 
    of their freedom from war, poverty and uncertainty in Africa 
    climaxes with the rejection, misgivings and hardships of life in 
    the observation camp. Living with other refugees the trio are 
    challenged by myriad elements and the harsh realities of life in 
    the west.

Hi Mazi ,
Merry Christmas and a prosperous new year mazi 
    . How are you doing?
Could you tell me why l cannot reach you with the phone number 
    you supplied me? l have added 00 to  using eurocity 
    card meant for W.Europe, USA and Canada 
    but was told that l was not allowed to reach this destination 
    (which cannot be true because a colleague reaches his Polish family 
    with it).
l'm waiting to hear from you soonest.
Cheers
Mazi ,
Thanks for your last mail. The dates you chose have sorted out 
    my troubles and confussion. 
    They have solved 's proposed 
    UK visit, even though he has not told me whether or not this 
    academic trip will enable him to see me. But I don't want to 
    take anything for granted. Whether he replies to my inquiry or not 
    has now been overtaken by events. Come any date in April now I will 
    be around, by God's grace. Then on May 10th, I will be 
    cracking jokes with you physically; take some strolls with you on 
    the 11th and on the 12th I will be headed home.
No, my human angel will not be travelling with me. I don't 
    want some uncalled-for attitudes. But the other angels will be my 
    bodyguards.
Please do not fail to let me know what to expect so that I will 
    start to prepare myself. First, I have been reliably informed that 
    I will need someone to take me from the airport since Polish 
    citizens on the roads or vehicles have no business with the 
    Queen's English.
Remain belssed as we keep in 
    touch.
Cheers.
Mazi ,
Please could you look at the dates below and tell me the one you 
    think will be good for you. The earlier I choose a date and make a 
    booking the cheaper the airfare becomes for me as 
    bro  
     is not forthcoming with the dates 
    he will be in the UK in April. I can't keep waiting for him 
    indefinitely, not even my voice mail has been responded to on his 
    return from Naija. It appears he is very 
    busy so I can't press him further on coming back.
The dates are: 23-25 April, 1-4, 10-12, 17-19 May. As it suits 
    you. If I spend one quality day with you it might help, isn't 
    it?
Cheers.
Mazi ,
Thanks for writing back so soon.
This age and times no longer require registration of business 
    for people to look for means of survival. How could you forget 
    this? I do not need a registration of those Ltds to buy a car from 
    Poland and send to Nigeria if we can find it cheaper there, or do 
    I? Yes, that is what I am talking about. Make your 
    inquries about what we can be 
    buying from there that are cheap and send to someone like 
      to dispose for us in 
    Lagos, take his cut, and send ours. Money? We can always use my 
    credit cards which I will keep repaying bit by bit if are sure of 
    some profit. We are not getting younger and retirement age is fast 
    approaching.
Thanks for your prompt invitation. I am actually thinking of 
    March/April so that I will recover from my US trip. If your 
    itinarary is ok in those 
    months, especially April you let me know.
Bless you. Thanks for your pic which 
    refused to get larger than the miniature.

Mazi ,
Bless you. Thanks for your mail at last.
It is true that I have become a traveller looking for any 
    international rather than local business. If you know what we could 
    get cheap in Poland and sell it elsewhere to make money please do 
    let me know.
The time being wasted doing one job and not realising anything 
    tangeable can be frustrating. I 
    have always told those who have the ear to listen that the Whiteman 
    has designed things such that you will eat and clothe yourself from 
    any job you do. Then pays all the taxes and bills and have little 
    or nothing to save at the end of the month. While this is happening 
    people home keep expecting you to send them elephants each 
    month.
So, I have decided to move around to see what to do. If it 
    clicks then the present job will go for good.
When you take a good look at the calender could you tell me the 
    month I could possibly check you up in 
     . When this is done I will also look at the suggested dates and 
    tell you how they run with my work roster which has been drawn to 
    the end of the year. I will spend two to three days with you.
Cheers and remain blessed.

Mazi ,
Happy New Year to you and to your family!
Thanks for your mail. It is good to read that you are ok and in 
    good spirit despite the sad situation at home, especially with 
    .
Did they stop your pay on the grounds that you have overstayed 
    the approved time?
How are you going about fighting the stopped salary? I know that 
    your physicalprescence will 
    make a difference but some brethren who are lecturers there can 
    also make some moves for you.
Your wife should be strong for you and for the children at this 
    time and pick up her healing from the Lord. I know it may be hard 
    for her but she does not need to give up at this eleventh hour when 
    you have made some in-roads already.
How is your programme progressing? What areas of breakthrough 
    with your acada at the moment?
I spent the Christmas period with the 
    s. He could not lay hands on your 
    number, we all would have said merry Christmas to you. My own phone 
    went dead as I did not take my charger with me else I would have 
    checked for your number.
I came back from  and picked up 
    some of those fevers and coughs and 
    cattarah that must have been hiding somewhere since I 
    returned from Nigeria. I have been out of job as a result for a 
    couple of days now. I dragged myself to check mails now.
Please do write again soon.
Bless you.

Mazi ,
Please accept our verbal Christmas card and greetings.
It is quite unfortunate that I have not come your way for a long 
    time now. I hope you have been hearing 
    form your wife and children? Do you have a last minute plan 
    to travel home in the next couple of days like you did last year or 
    is it two?
I was home in November and stayed for four weeks, returning on 
    the 18th of December. I produced some tracts for use by churches 
    and fellowships.
I shall say more on this later.
Cheers.
Mazi ,
Our spirit is one. As I was telling myself that it is long 
    overdue to do you a mail little did I know that you were already in 
    my mail box waiting for me.
Bless you real good. The Good Lord has always been faithful to 
    those who put their trust in Him.
My brother, I hope you are doing fine body, soul and spirit? 
    How bookuru? 
    Ma ndi ulo gi? God 
    will bring us together one day. I have applied for the oyibo 
    man's naturalisation. At the most it will take seven months to 
    materialise. They say the volume of application is great. That will 
    be followed with the application for the corresponding passport 
    after which I could travel with ease. The devil is fighting using 
    human agent to deny me the opportunity but the battle is the Lords. 
    By His grace, my hands are clean in not planning evil against 
    anyone therefore I am not afraid.
How is your work doing? Have you been learning Polish language? 
    I told my Polish colleagues that it might take me over 20 years to 
    learn the swiswiswi they speak here.
Please write again soon and speak much this time around.
Cheers
Mazi ,
Thanks a lot for your mail. God bless you real good.
I am happy that you have got some dates at your disposal. I took 
    a look at the visa requirement for Poland and was surprised that 
    one can even go to USA ten times over before one can receive Polish 
    visa. I hope to give you extracts of what I found out soonest.
The whole thing looks like a code which needs to be cracked. I 
    shall find a way though, even if it may take time. But by 
    God's grace I will see your face one day, God keeping us 
    alive.
""See you again soon""
Cheers
Mazi ,
It is nice reading from you. More importantly to know that you 
    are kicking fine like Nigeria's under 17 soccer world 
    conquerors. But I wish you are sharing from the bounties which the 
    country is showering on them.
I am happy that you are working hard to finish in record time. 
    The Lord will grant you that prayer in Jesus's name.
Yes I had always thought of retraining (not taught, as you put 
    it, since I am not sure of teaching). The problem really is that I 
    am not sure if I can raise the type of fees for education down here 
    after which one is not too sure of getting job with better pay as 
    our age continue to add. The youth now have an edge.
Is it like  
     who left the comforts of UNN and 
    took his family to settle in the US only to do all kinds of 
    minial jobs including working in 
    post office.
Someone who should have become a 
    prof long ago taking some good N200 000 and above per month. 
    When I heard of him last he was not even doing anything. The 
    brother I spoke with in the US two years ago was even promising him 
    a job to do care job with his clinic. I have considered the option 
    of teaching, with a view to training in PGDE to acqauint me fully 
    with the standard here. But one must produce evidence that one has 
    worked with children before of a particular age one desire to 
    teach. The process is like passing through the eye of a 
    niddle.
Mazi , it is really not the best 
    out in oyibo land.
If our country didn't turn out to be so corrupt how could 
    we all desire to leave home where our communal way of doing things 
    are more satisfying. Yes, we have electricity, water, good roads, 
    efficient transportation, jobs (no matter how poor) etc over here 
    but what about other things like relationship? How many people have 
    I visited this year and how many have been here? Maybe one or two. 
    (I was begging someone over a week ago so that I could visit their 
    family. It hasn't worked out). Is this it? What about 
    evangelism and all that? How many people are ready to give you one 
    minute to hear you preach to them? People at home think they are 
    missing heaven by not being abroad. But they don't know they 
    are not missing anything no matter how imperfect our systems may 
    really be.
Anyway, I do not know if I will say that I am confused as to 
    what to put my hands in. My wife has completed a degree and masters 
    degree in pharmacy yet no job for over a year now. Some two/three 
    weeks ago she was pursuing admission into the nursing profession. 
    Now she is frantically looking for job into anything. One of the 
    problems is that our tongue are not easily understood by the 
    average British. So how can you get a job when you cannot be easily 
    understood? Our closest White neighbour says she can understand me 
    but can hardly pick a word when my wife speaks. You must strain and 
    use no 6 to understand what this White lady is saying. I'm not 
    sure you have heard the Typical English person speak. I mean the 
    uneducated ones in particular. Don't mind the news readers. 
    Theirs look more like special English meant for everyone to 
    understand. I can go on and on. In any case, I will still be 
    praying for God to lead me into something that will be more 
    beneficial to me when I leave for home, God willing.
Have I entertained you?
Remain blessed.
Mazi ,
May the Good Lord continue to be your father even as you 
    continue to trust Him.
How are you doing brother, in faraway ? lt has been 
    long and I must apologise for not having knocked on your door all 
    this while.
First, I believe that your health is very much intact and that 
    your family is kept in touch with constantly.How are they doing?
What developments with your acada and teachers and researches? 
    Please keep me updated, including the job search. The last time we 
    spoke you promised to get me informed of any info geared towards 
    looking out for a vac job for you here 
    in the UK. Remember l promised to do all I can to help out if I 
    could get info about a non- 
    recident searching for job over here.
Please write soon.

NigerianEnglish,could,Justice Ogebe was disappointed that parties could not address the tribunal as planned,dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,Pr_11,"Tribunal gives Iwu 24 hours to reply Atiku
From Kunle Olasanmi, Abuja
In 24 hours, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) 
    Chairman Maurice Iwu must answer some questions on last year’s 
    presidential election, the tribunal said yesterday.
Prof. Iwu is to anwer 
    27 questions raised by Action Congress (AC) candidate Atiku 
    Abubakar, who is challenging the election of President Umaru 
    Yar’Adua.
The Supreme Court last Friday gave Atiku the go-ahead to ask him 
    the questions, which he says are relevant to the determination of 
    his petition .
Some ministers and governors were at the court yesterday to show 
    their support for the President –an action the Action Congress (AC) 
    condemned as a ploy to intimidate the tribunal.
The former Vice President sued Yar’Adua, INEC, the Inspector 
    General of Police and the Chief of Army Staff before the tribunal 
    over the conduct of last year’s presidential election.
He said there were irregularities in the conduct of the April 21 
    election.
Parties at the tribunal were supposed to adopt their written 
    briefs yesterday but that was altered by the judgment of the 
    Supreme Court which ordered Iwu to be interrogated by counsel to 
    Atiku, Prof Alfred Kasumu (SAN).
Atiku formulated 27 questions for the INEC Chairman.
Yesterday, Kasumu told the tribunal chairman, Justice James 
    Ogebe, that there was a Supreme Court judgment last Friday, which 
    ordered that Iwu be interrogated.
He said the INEC chairman was expected to respond to those 
    questions and also file a written address.
Counsel to INEC, Mr. Kanu Agabi (SAN), agreed with 
    Kasumu.
But Counsel to Yar’Adua, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) objected, 
    saying that Kasumu should file his written address before INEC 
    could respond.
Justice Ogebe turned to Olanipekun and said that if INEC had 
    agreed with Kasumu, there was little or nothing he (Olanipekun) 
    could do to change the position because INEC is more concerned in 
    the interrogatories.
Kasumu’s position was agreed upon.
Agabi is expected to file his response to the interrogatories 
    today and his final address tomorrow. Olanipekun is to file his 
    final address on Thursday.
When Kasumu told the court about the judgment of the apex court, 
    Agabi said the Chairman of INEC would have responded to the 
    question immediately he became aware of the judgment but could not 
    because some staff who could assist him with the information 
    concerning the questions had left their offices.
The tribunal wanted to hear the petition filed by General 
    Muhammadu Buhari, the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) presidential 
    candidate in the April, last year election, but his counsel, Chief 
    Mike Ahamba (SAN), objected , 
    saying that he would wait for the interrogatories to be answered 
    before proceeding.
Buhari is also challenging the election of Yar’Adua at the 
    tribunal.
Justice Ogebe was disappointed that parties could not address 
    the tribunal as planned.
""I am disappointed that this matter could not go on today. 
    We have agreed at the last adjourned date that parties would 
    address the court today and a date will be fixed for judgment.
""The whole world is watching what we are doing here and 
    they are also waiting for the outcome,"" Justice Ogebe said.
Yar’Adua’s in-law and the governor of Kebbi State, Seidu 
    Dakingari, was at the tribunal. Also in court was his counterpart 
    in Nasarawa State, Aliyu Akwe Doma,
The minister of Energy, Odenyi Ajumogobia; Prince Adetokunbo 
    Kayode (Tourism); Godwin Abe (Interior); John Odey (Information) 
    and Aja Nwachukwu (Education) were there.
Police chief Mike Okiro, one of the respondents in the petition, 
    was also present. Buhari was there.
Thousands of supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 
    were in court to also show their solidarity to the President.
Scores of anti-riot policemen had a hectic time controlling the 
    crowd at the tribunal.
The court adjourned till February 4 for the final adoption of 
    briefs.
Last Friday, the apex court held: ""Our laws demand that he 
    (Iwu) provide answers to the question and I so hold.
""Court of law cannot sacrifice justice on the altar of 
    speed. A party who demands interrogatory and is denied, is denied 
    fair hearing.""
Atiku brought the interrogatories under Order 33, Rule 1 (1) and 
    Order 3, as well as Order 26, Rule 27 of the Federal High Court 
    Rules and Paragraph 17 (1) and 50 of the 1st schedule to the 
    Electoral Act, 2007.
In the motion paper signed by Kasumu, the request ""to serve 
    interrogatories on Iwu in terms of the questions formulated"" 
    on the order paper were expressed.
Among the questions put forward were issues relating to the 
    award of contracts for the printing of ballot papers to an unnamed 
    South African firm five days to the election even though the 
    company had earlier expressed its inability to deliver such papers 
    on schedule.
The former vice president wants the tribunal to help him 
    ascertain whether or not it was true the company in question had 
    expressed it incapability ""on 
    the ground that delivery deadline was unrealistic if the ballots 
    must carry serial numbers and be in booklet form with 
    counterfoils"".
He also wants Iwu to disclose the ""reasons for the 
    re-award"" of the contract and whether or not the company in 
    question supplied the documents for which it got the contract.
Aside from these questions, Atiku urged the tribunal to allow 
    him interrogate Iwu on whether or not he supplied Anambra, Adamawa, 
    Bauchi, Benue, Cross River, Ebonyi, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Imo, 
    Jigawa, Katsina, Kebbi, Kwara, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, Ogun, Osun 
    and Zamfara states INEC offices with the ballot papers emanating 
    from such a contract for the election.
Similarly, the former vice president wants INEC to answer 
    questions relating to contracts for the construction of voting 
    cubicles for use by voters to thumb-printing during the 
    election.
Specifically, he wanted to know whether the contract for such a 
    project was executed at all and the specific company or companies 
    that won the contracts.
Mr Rickey Tarfa (SAN), who led a team of lawyers to represent 
    Atiku before the tribunal said: ""Answers to these pertinent 
    questions will help us canvass our arguments that the election was 
    flawed.""

Federal Government policies on student financing for higher 
    education programmes tenable in the country and abroad aim at 
    making higher education more accessible to qualified Nigerian 
    students, especially the 
    indigents and the people in difficult circumstances.
The National Policy on Education (1981) states that 
    'financial consideration alone will not be the conclusive bar 
    to higher education for any one who can benefit from it. A 
    combination of scholarships and loans will continue to be used to 
    assist indigent but bright students to gain access to higher 
    education'.
Historical Background
In Nigeria, students financing for higher education could be 
    said to have begun with the introduction of western education by 
    the missionaries. In the 19th Century, 
    education was financed with church donations and contributions by 
    philanthropic organisations and individuals. The colonial 
    administration later contributed through grants and with the 
    passing of education law-the '1882 Education 
    Ordinance' government financial involvement was 
    started.
As early as the 19th century, young 
    Nigerians were sponsored for higher education abroad to Sierra 
    Leone, Gold Coast now Ghana and the United Kingdom. By the early 
    20th century, students and education 
    were financed by regional governments in the form of aids.The 
    private sector financed education through fees and contributions by 
    the missions and individual donors.
After independence, student financing, by the three regional 
    governments -Northern, Eastern and Western, was vigorously pursued 
    through financing students for higher education in Nigerian 
    universities and higher institutions in the United Kingdom and the 
    United States of America. This was occasioned by the need to 
    provide high-level manpower for the running of the independent 
    Nigerian State. The buoyant financial resources emanating from the 
    oil boom of the early 1970s after the Nigerian civil war further 
    facilitated financing students. In fact, 
    theNigerian Students' 
    Loans Board was established by Decree 25 of 1972, and reconstituted 
    by Decree 12 of 1988, essentially to assist students to finance 
    their education through loans.
However, by the early 1980s, the fortunes of student financing 
    began to witness a downward trend. This was mainly due to dwindling 
    financial resources as a result of economic recession occasioned by 
    the fall in oil prices and the reduction of production level by 
    OPEC, political instability, over-spending for other sectors at the 
    expense of education, the growth and expansion of higher 
    institutions coupled with the free-education policy at all levels 
    during the 1979-83 civilian, democratic regime.
The decade 1980 - 1990 witnessed a general decline in student 
    financing such that Federal Government sponsored overseas 
    scholarship award was suspended in 1985; awards under the Bureau 
    for External Aid (BEA) tenable in Eastern European Countries were 
    equally suspended due to the break-up of the Russian Federation; 
    scholarship awards tenable in Nigerian higher institutions became 
    reduced to one thousand (1,000) postgraduate awards only and even 
    then, payment of allowances was always in arrears.
In 1993, efforts were made to revamp student financing by the 
    establishment of Nigerian Education Bank by Decree 50 of 1997. The 
    Bank was to provide financial assistance to students in the 
    country's institutions of higher learning as well as 
    institutions and individuals in both public and private sectors 
    which participate in the educational sector; to make provision for 
    all inadequacies of the defunct Students Loans Board; to provide 
    loans to students to finance their education in institutions of 
    higher learning and to approve and disburse loans for educational 
    purposes. The defunct Nigerian Education Bank could not take-off 
    effectively mainly due to insufficient finance, administrative 
    bottlenecks and low loan repayment returns by student 
    beneficiaries. With the phasing out of Nigerian Education Bank, 
    students loan scheme has equally been suspended thereby narrowing 
    the opportunities for students' assistance towards their 
    education.
Revitalisation of Federal Government Scholarship 
    Schemes
Education, particularly higher education, is generally seen as a 
    very expensive, capital-intensive social service - even by the more 
    developed nations. Nigeria, faced with increasing enrolment in 
    universities and colleges, is constrained by shortage of funds, 
    insufficient management structures and capacities, inconsistency in 
    higher education policy, loss of highly skilled manpower to the 
    more developed countries, lack of coordination of government inputs 
    with that of non-governmental organisations and private sector 
    inputs, burden of civil strife, natural disasters and above all 
    unsustainable foreign debts. Since government has been the main 
    source of student financing ir Nigeria, the above unpleasant 
    scenario had in the past, negatively influenced efforts at 
    appreciable student financing programmes.
However, by the close of the 20th 
    century, student financing in Nigeria witnessed an unprecedented 
    boom with the coming to power of the present elected democratic 
    civilian government under President Olusegun Obasanjo (GCFR). Funds 
    allocated for revamping scholarship programmes were released last 
    year. The Federal Scholarship Board is now, more than ever before, 
    able to process awards tenable in the country and abroad and is 
    poised to aggressively pursue proactive student financing 
    programmes for the benefit of the teaming qualified Nigerian 
    students.
In spite of this, more avenues for sourcing funds need to be 
    exploited to meet the growing demands for financial assistance by 
    the numerous qualified students desiring to further their 
    education. The ongoing scholarship programmes that have been 
    over-subscribed can illustrate this. For the award tenable in 
    Nigerian tertiary institutions, a total of 39,574 were interviewed 
    between 19 November to 7 December 2001, out of which only about 
    15,000 will be awarded scholarships (i.e. 37.9%), for the first phase of 50,000 awards to be implemented for 
    the 2001,2002 academic year.
For the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP) 
    award, 1,418 qualified candidates with First Class and Second Class 
    Upper degrees were short-listed for interview for postgraduate 
    courses tenable overseas. However, only 53 (i.e. 
    3.7%), were nominated to six commonwealth member nations.
Largely, the three tiers of Government; (Federal, State, and 
    Local), through the award of scholarships and bursaries by their 
    agencies, sponsor students financing in Nigeria. At Federal level 
    the Federal Scholarship Board formulates policies on student 
    financing, implements various scholarship programmes of the Federal 
    Government tenable in the country and abroad and coordinates the 
    policies and programmes of state scholarship boards in order to 
    guide and streamline scholarship programmes nation wide.
Objectives of Federal Government Scholarship 
    Scheme
The main objectives of Federal Government Scholarship Award 
    Scheme include:
(i) To make higher education more accessible to the less 
    privileged and yet brilliant students who could not have been able 
    to afford the acquisition of such education,
(ii) To augment the normal education and manpower development 
    for high level manpower needs.
(iii) To reward, promote and encourage academic achievement and 
    excellence,
(iv) To enhance persistence or retention in schools,
(v) To balance educational opportunities,
(vi) To promote attainment of educational and national goals.
Ongoing Federal Government Scholarship Programmes
The Federal Government Scholarship programmes that are fully 
    operational and well funded by the present democratic civilian 
    government are as follows:
Scholarship Awards Tenable in Nigerian Tertiary 
    Institutions
These awards comprise postgraduate and undergraduate awards in 
    federal and state universities, awards for Higher National Diploma 
    (HND) in federal and states polytechnics; awards for Nigerian 
    Certificate in Education (NCE) in federal and states colleges of 
    education. As a result of the revitalisation of Federal Government 
    Scholarship programmes, 50,000 awards are being processed for the 
    2001/2002 academic year for students in these institutions. Funds 
    have been provided and the first phase of the award will be 
    implemented in April 2002, while the second phase will be completed 
    before the end of the academic year 2001/2002.
Details of the Nigerian award programme can be found in the 
    'Implementation Blueprint' for 
    federal Government Scholarship Awards tenable in Nigerian Tertiary 
    Institutions, (2001).
However, it is necessary to note, that the awards are for 
    students who are in the various institutions in their second year 
    of study and above and who have scored a minimum of 3.00 
    Cumulative Grade Point Aggregate (CGPA) in the previous academic 
    year's examination. For a scholar to continue to enjoy the 
    award, the 3.00 CGPA must be maintained. The people in 
    difficult circumstances, (the handicapped) are given automatic 
    scholarship after participating in the due process of the award 
    i.e. attending school, attaining a CGPA of 3.0 
    or more, completing and submitting duly endorsed application form 
    and attending award interview. The awards are targeted mainly at 
    indigent students to assist them gain access to higher 
    education.
Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan 
    (CSFP)
The participation of Nigeria in the activities of the 
    Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP) began after 
    independence in 1960 by virtue of our membership of the 
    Commonwealth of Nations. Since then, Nigeria has been involved in 
    the CSFP programmes as a receiving and awarding country and 
    continues to believe in and abide by the principles establishing 
    the Commonwealth and the CSFP awards.
Nigeria as a full member of the Commonwealth continues to 
    promote the aims and objectives fof CSFP, which include:
(i) Desire to strengthen the Commonwealth.
(ii) Recognition and promotion of the highest standard of 
    intellectual achievement, technical and professional 
    performance.
(iii) Supporting the national development needs of the 
    Commonwealth, encouraging mobility of scholars among participating 
    countries and contributing to a deeper understanding of the 
    organisation.
(iv) Strengthening higher educational institutions.
(v) Encouraging international development needs of overseas aid 
    policy.
(vi) Winning long-term friends for the host country.
(vii) Promoting opportunities for international study in the 
    host country.
Since inception, Nigeria has received over 1000 awards from 
    other Commonwealth Nations with the highest awards from the United 
    Kingdom and Canada. Nigeria has equally granted over 180 awards.
Currently Nigeria is processing 30 awards to various member 
    nations for the 2002/2003 academic year. In addition, plans are 
    underway to provide more scholarships to Sierra Leonian students 
    for studies in the various tertiary institutions in Nigeria as 
    directed by His Excellency, President Olusegun Obasanjo (GCFR).
It is hoped that member nations given awards will, this time, 
    fully utilise the awards, as Nigeria is equally ready to utilise 
    all offers to be made by other countries.
The list of countries offered CSFP Scholarships tenable in 
    Nigeria for the year 2002/2003 are: Brunei Darussalam, Canada, 
    Cyprus, Ghana, Kenya, Malaysia, Mosambique, New Zealand, Pakistan, 
    Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Trinidad & Tobago and 
    the United Kingdom.
In line with the overall objective of the Commonwealth 
    Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP), which emphasises 
    partnership and sharing of expertise, resources and knowledge 
    between commonwealth countries and for the progress of CSFP in 
    Nigeria and the Commonwealth as a whole, the Federal Government of 
    Nigeria needs to consider the following:
(i) Full involvement in the activities and programmes of 
    CSFP.
(ii) Reciprocate awards to member nations regularly.
(iii) Using the Canadian experience, Nigeria should explore the 
    possibility of using Distance Learning in the near future to 
    process and implement Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan 
    awards in neighbouring African Commonwealth member nations such as 
    Ghana, Sierra Leone, Cameroon and The Gambia.
(iv) Nigerian Universities should be encouraged to participate 
    fully in the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan programme 
    by also making reciprocal awards through universities sole funding 
    or co-funding Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan 
    awards.
(v) In order for Nigeria to benefit maximally from Commonwealth 
    Scholarship and Fellowship Plan programmes, there is need for 
    diversification of the present award scheme whereby Nigeria could 
    share the cost of the programme with the awarding country.The 
    awarding country could take responsibility for tuition, 
    accommodation and medical facilities while Nigeria takes care of 
    the scholars' upkeep allowances, passages, books and research 
    allowances. In this way, more candidates will have opportunity to 
    study abroad and be exposed to modern facilities and technology.
(vi) Encourage private sector organisations, national and 
    international foundations, and public-spirited individuals to 
    participate in CSFP programmes.

Ex-Delta governor’s loyalists protest
From Godwin Isenyo,
Kaduna and Edo Ugbagwu
Former Governor of Delta State Chief James Ibori lost yesterday 
    his battle for bail at a Federal High Court sitting in Kaduna. But 
    his case is to get accelerated hearing.
He is charged with alleged corruption, money laundering and 
    other financial crimes by the Economic and Financial Crimes 
    Commission (EFCC).
In Lagos, former Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose was arraigned 
    for allegedly laundering N893,396,021.50, $100,000 and 
    £111,600. He was ordered to be remanded in prison.
The court ordered that Ibori be remanded in the prison till 
    January 11, next year when it will begin the trial proper.
The EFCC alleges that Ibori stole N9.1 billion belonging 
    to Delta State. He was arraigned on a 103-count charge to which the 
    former governor pleaded not guilty.
Also charged with the former governor are Miss Uzoamaka 
    Okoronkwo and three companies – Mer Engineering Nig. Ltd, 
    Bainonex Limited and Sagicon Nigeria Limited.
Mr Justice Mohammed Lawal Shuaibu ruled that the court denied 
    the former governor bail because there were not enough material 
    evidence for granting the application.
He said in cases of this nature, the onus of establishing the 
    argument for bail rested with the defendant, ""but the defence 
    counsel did not fully discharge that responsibility.
""The issue in contention is not whether the charge must be 
    accompanied by proof of evidence. But, however, failing to do so 
    will make the court to exercise its discretion favourably in 
    granting bail,"" Mr Justice Shuaibu said 
    :
He went on: ""But, considering the duty of the accused’s 
    counsel, applicants failed to make sufficient material for the use 
    of the court in the determination of the application, and also 
    taking into account that the guidelines for consideration of bail 
    are not water-tight, the 
    absence of proof of evidence will therefore not be a factor in 
    determining the merits or demerits of the application.
""This presupposes that the court will only be disposed to 
    other considerations before delving into the merits of the 
    application.
""Consideration is also given in the case of Abiola against 
    the Federal Republic of Nigeria (SUPRA) and the case of Musa 
    against Commissioner of Police (2004, Nigeria Weekly Law Report 
    part K79483) and it is my view that the circumstances in such cases 
    are not the same as in the instant case.
""In the instant case, the accused applicants are arraigned 
    before this court and the prosecution has applied for a trial 
    date.
""All the 103 counts of the charge in which the accused 
    applicants are charged are bailable offences; and the next germane 
    issues to consider are the materials placed before the court which 
    will determine whether or not to grant bail in favour of the 
    accused applicants.
""The learned senior counsel, Mr. Daudu, has 
    submitted that the accused applicants will surrender themselves for 
    trial which the prosecution debunked.
""Availability of the accused to stand trial has always been 
    an important factor to be considered by the court.
""In the light of the above and considering the surrounding 
    circumstances of this case, the accused applicants have not placed 
    before the court sufficient materials with which the court will 
    exercise its own noble discretion in granting bail before the 
    trial.
""The application for bail in respect of the first and 
    second accused applicants is hereby refused and in the circumstance 
    an accelerated trial is hereby granted. That’s my ruling.""
At about 8:00a.m, amidst tight 
    security, the accused persons were driven into the court premises 
    in a gray metallic Peugeot Expert with Nasarawa registration 
    number, AA 698NNN.
Mr Joseph. B. Daudu 
    (SAN) urged the court to grant bail to the former governor since 
    the offence was bailable, saying that all the 103-count charges 
    were brought under the Money Laundering Act 2003 and 2004 and none 
    carried death sentence.
According to Daudu, there was no proof of evidence attached to 
    the charges to enable the judge assess the prosecution’s strength 
    of evidence. ""The authorities are in favour of bail being 
    granted where there is no proof.""
But, the EFCC counsel, Mr Rotimi Jacobs, said that the argument 
    adduced by the defence counsel was not enough to justify his 
    client’s bail because the manner in which Ibori was arrested was 
    yet to be told.
He argued that the commission had facts to prove that Ibori was 
    not a man to be granted bail, adding that the former governor has a 
    criminal record.
Mr Justice Shuaibu insisted that the defence counsel refused to 
    discharge his responsibility as to why his client should be granted 
    bail.
He then ordered an accelerated hearing of the case and also 
    ordered that the former governor be in the prison custody, based 
    upon the request of the defence counsel who complained of 
    non-accessibility to his client at the EFCC custody where he 
    (Ibori) was initially detained.
Daudu, who said he was satisfied with the ruling, said there was 
    nothing unusual for a judge to refuse bail.
In Lagos, Fayose pleaded not guilty to a 51-count charge of 
    financial improprieties.
Fayose, at a Federal High Court, was accused of laundering about 
    N133, 864,820 of the state’s money through two companies 
    –Biological Concepts Nigeria Limited and Avian Specialist Nigeria 
    Limited.
The funds were meant for the state’s integrated poultry project 
    scheme, the court was told.
The charge was a substitute of an earlier one filed by the 
    Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) last year.
An aide of Fayose, Goke Olatunji, and businessman Gbenga James 
    standing trial in the old charge.
Mr Justice Tijani Abubakar inquired about the whereabout of the 
    duo (Olatunji and James). EFCC lawyer Wahab Shittu said the 
    commission had dropped all the charges against them.
Shittu told the court that the new charge contains the old 
    facts.
The old charge contained Fayose’s name but when it was filed, he 
    could not be prosecuted because of his constitutional immunity.
By discharging Olatunji and James, EFCC may decide to use them 
    as prosecution witnesses against Fayose.
At about 10.15 am, Fayose, who was dressed in a white 
    check long sleeve shirt and a light brown pair of trousers held in 
    place by a white belt, was led into the dock.
While in the dock, he removed a brown baseball cap he wore and 
    remained standing as the charges were read out.
He pleaded not guilty to them all.
The judge ordered that Fayose be remanded in prison.
The prison remand was at the instance of his lawyers led by two 
    Senior Advocates, Mallam Yussuf Ali and Mr. Adebayo Oba 
    Adelodun.
But Shittu opposed the choice of prison remand.
Alli said: ""I ask that the accused be remanded in prison 
    custody.""
Justice Abubakar said: ""This is the first time I am seeing 
    an accused person opting for prison.""
He (Shittu) eventually agreed.
Mr. Justice Abubakar expressed dismay at the choice of 
    prison remand by Fayose but nevertheless granted him his wishes.
Following his not-guilty plea, Shittu had asked the court to 
    keep the accused in EFCC’s custody and requested for a trial date 
    to prove the allegations preferred against Fayose who was impeached 
    last year in controversial circumstances.
Ali made spirited efforts to make oral application for his 
    (Fayose) bail.
But Mr. Justice Abubakar advised Ali against the move and 
    told him to file a formal application for the bail.
Ali readily accepted Mr. Justice Abubakar’s suggestion 
    and the matter was adjourned till January 10.
Fayose, who criticized the overzealousness of the EFCC 
    operatives in court said:
""Give me breathing space, I am a former governor and a 
    leader in Nigeria. Give me space when I walk. Accord me maximum 
    respect as a former governor.""
Fayose reminded the EFCC operatives that his present 
    circumstance was temporal. ""This travail is temporary,"" 
    he said.
Asked to comment on the charges, Fayose declined.
""This is not the time to comment as you well know, silence 
    is golden,"" he said even as he acknowledged cheers from court 
    officials and others.

15th April, 2007.
The Chairman;
 District Council,
,
 State.
Sir,
LACK OF GOOD ROAD IN  STATE.
Many people are quite aware of the good works your council has 
    done (and is still doing) throughout our district. For instance, 
    the Council has established many secondary schools and primary 
    schools, Adult literary classes, Dispensaries and Maternity Homes. 
    There is even pipe-borne water in our town and outside the town. 
    This is quite good and highly commendable.
However, there is a Particular field which your council seems to 
    have neglected. There is an acute lack of good roads in 
     state . 
    mmost especially the major road that 
    leds to the market square. For 
    instance we don't have a good road that 
    will lead us to the neighbouring town 
    inorder to enable use to buy 
    and sell our farm produces.
Moreso, most of our people 
    have to  a far distance journey that will last 
    for two days as the result of these. some of them are been attack 
    and rape on their way to sell their farm product. Also
     the bad roads had put a stop from going to 
    the nex next village to sell our farm produce 
    and they too can not sell nor buy our farm product.
Furthermore, the lack of good roads has cause a lot of shortage 
    in our agricultural products. Because they lack good and 
    inadquate 
    farmering equipment, their farm 
    produce is dieing 
    slowin gradually because lack of manure and 
    their land is not yielding like before. Which you also know that is 
    not everything that the farmer can do on it  
    but with the help of tractor and plough but 
    due to the bad roads we don't have any of 1 
    character those equ-ipment present now in our 
    own town.
Also due to this bad roads those of our 
    people and youth that w e s were suppose to be 
    in this town farmering and 
    schooling went out because of the far distances 
     they encounter. Sir, I recommend, as Immediate relief 
    meas-ures, that you allocate money for the reconstruction 
    of destro-yed 
    infracture inorder to 
    make leaving lively for us.
Therefore, as our 
    representitive you could use your good office to influence 
    governmental attitude to good roads in 
     State. If our farmers are provided with modern implements like 
    good roads, tractors and plough,  
    state could become the food basket of the State.
Inconclusion, 
    government should try to construct a good road to make 
    transportation easy, and interrelationship between the two 
    neighbouring town. 
I would be grateful if you could give the issue raise in this 
    letter the utmost attention it deserves 
    in- order to stem down 
    the public out cry about 
    constructing good roads in our area.
Yours faithfully

NigerianEnglish,could,To even imagine that Governor Oshiomhole could give his imprimatur to such anti people and wasteful scheme is very disturbing and shameful in the least,epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,bl_07,"Our student-governors
Sir: Trust Nigerian politicians and slogans. At the dawn of the 
    current administration, many elected political office holders took 
    various titles as a reflection of what they will do in office. For 
    instance, it was the ‘servant leader’ 
    in Abuja, in Minna ‘chief servant’, in 
    Uyo ‘digital governor’ and in Benin it 
    was ‘comrade governor’ and today across 
    the states we now have ‘student governors 
    ’'
It was a thing of shame and surprise to Nigerians, when it was 
    published in some dailies that our governors under the 
    instrumentality of the Governors Forum were going to Kennedy School 
    of Governance to ‘learn’ or better 
    still be ‘taught’ the act of 
    governance.
When l read this latest on the unending show of shame by our 
    governors, l thought they should have also added the name of 
    president Yar’Adua as one of the participants at the course, 
    especially in the area of implementing the seven point agenda which 
    has remained an albatross on his government.
Words cannot express how I feel at this latest show of 
    insensitivity on the part of our governors. To even imagine that 
    Governor Oshiomhole could give his imprimatur to such anti people 
    and wasteful scheme is very disturbing and shameful in the least. 
    That’s one man who is fast frittering away the immense goodwill he 
    had gathered over the years.
Some of these governors spent tens of millions campaigning for 
    political offices, only to turn around in the middle of their term 
    to this newfound fever of ‘good 
    governance’. So what have they been doing since they 
    came to office? How about such governors who spent so many months 
    at the tribunals fighting to upturn the election of the sitting 
    governors? So they all came unprepared. This is totally 
    unacceptable to us as it amounts to learning how to use one’s left 
    hand in old age.
Our governors do not need to go America or London to learn the 
    act of governance, but even if they must do so at all, it should be 
    a precondition for contesting for the office of the governor and 
    not during their term.
Interestingly, the officials of the Kennedy School of Governance 
    of the Harvard University described the programme as first of its 
    kind in Africa. Unknown to them and unlike what obtains in advanced 
    societies, such gaffes are commonplace in Nigeria, especially among 
    those in government. After all, this is about the only country 
    where you hear military authorities boasting about military feats 
    accomplished against defenceless citizens as if such feats were 
    recorded against the US army. I wish we could fight corruption with 
    a similar momentum. What of the governors, especially those from 
    the Niger Delta region, who have failed to make any meaningful 
    impact on the lives of their people well half past their tenure? 
    This country can be very unbearable. Our constitution is a military 
    heritage bequeathed to us by the captors of the Nigerian state. 
    Rather than fixing our national problems in a most nationalistic 
    and selfless manner, the chambers of the National Assembly are 
    engulfed in the vortex of a leadership tussle, fighting over who 
    should occupy choice positions in the Constitution Amendment 
    Committee.
Your excellencies, having said this much, l most passionately 
    appeal to you to keep to the ideals of the founding fathers of the 
    Governors’ Forum as an avenue for brainstorming on finding 
    solutions to our common national challenges, and not as a conduit 
    pipe for wasteful and senseless spending.
Instead of this school of governance, may l invite your 
    excellencies to refer to section 14 (1) (b) of our constitution 
    that says “the security and welfare of the people shall be the 
    primary purpose of government” Anything done along this line, like 
    providing quality and affordable education, basic infrastructure, 
    tackling corruption among others would indeed engender our welfare 
    and security, which are the concomitants of ‘good 
    governance’.
Going to America to learn how to do this is a most needless 
    expedition and should therefore be called off. The money intended 
    for such trips should rather be used to improve educational 
    facilities in the various states. This indeed would be the hallmark 
    of good governance, which our governors do not need to go America 
    to learn.

NigerianEnglish,could,However progress could not be sustained resulting in a major resurgence of wild polio virus transmission in 2008 such The Minister elaborated on how the nation placed emphasis on the importance of vaccination is a crucial tool for preventing and controlling the disease,dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,Pr_52,"Polio eradication: How Nigeria faced the world at World 
    Health Assembly
WHEN the 62nd World Health Assembly opened at the Palais de 
    Nations in Geneva Switzerland on May 18, 2009, one of the major 
    health concerns of international interest, besides the (then) 
    looming H1N1 influenza (swine flu) pandemic, was the race towards 
    global target for eradication of poliomyelitis.
Still plagued by the ghosts of the October 2003 controversy 
    surrounding the immunisation programme against polio in which three 
    states in northern Nigeria (Kano, Katsina and Jigawa) boycotted the 
    polio immunisation campaign, it was not surprising that Nigeria has 
    remained squarely in the eye of the storm about polio 
    eradication.
At the time of the boycott, the Global Polio Eradication 
    Initiative had launched what was hoped to be the final onslaught 
    against polio, with a plan to immunise more than 15 million 
    children in West and Central Africa.
There had been particular concerns about the high prevalence of 
    polio cases in Nigeria, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) had 
    it on record that the nation accounted for about 45 per cent of 
    polio cases worldwide and 80 per cent of cases reported from the 
    African region in 2003. The high prevalence was attributed to poor 
    vaccine coverage during the previous control campaigns. No thanks 
    to the boycott, the nation is now one of the four nations 
    (alongside…..) on the yet to interrupt the wild poliovirus 
    transmission.
In 2008, during the 61st WHA, one of the resolutions adopted at 
    the end of the meeting was that Nigeria should strive to “reduce 
    the risk of international spread of poliovirus.”
Expectedly, this particular resolution was primal on the agenda 
    which the Nigerian delegation to the meeting had committed to 
    address along with issues concerning maternal and child health, 
    malaria control, pandemic influenza prevention and control, non 
    communicable disease prevention and control, and national 
    legislation on health, among others.
So as the 62nd WHA got under way, the world was all ears to know 
    just how far the country had progressed. No one was better placed 
    to tell the story than Nigeria’s own Minister of Health, Prof. Babatunde Osotimehin, who led the 28-man delegation to the 
    event.
Mounting the rostrum, Osotimehin delved into the series of 
    activities and events the nation had undertaken to meet the WHA 
    mandate as far as polio was concerned.
Noting that Nigeria did make appreciable progress in polio 
    eradication from 1998-2002 but suffered a major set-back in 
    2003-2004 as a result of controversy over the safety of the Oral 
    Polio Vaccine (OPV), he said: “That setback ensured that Nigeria is 
    one of only four countries yet to interrupt the wild poliovirus 
    transmission in the World. Following this, polio eradication 
    efforts were intensified. These include new innovations aimed at 
    improving effectiveness of polio eradication activities, 
    utilization of the more effective monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine 
    (mOPVs), and mOPV3 with an integrated approach, and adoption of the 
    Immunization Plus Days (IPDs+).
During IPDs, a broad range of child survival interventions 
    resulted in marked improvement of the quality of vaccinations and a 
    significant decline in incidence of wild polio transmission. 
    However progress could not be sustained resulting in a major 
    resurgence of wild polio virus transmission in 2008 
    such
The Minister elaborated on how the nation placed emphasis on the 
    importance of vaccination is a crucial tool for preventing and 
    controlling the disease.
Already, in line with the resolution adopted at the 61st World 
    Health Assembly urging Nigeria to “reduce the risk of international 
    spread of poliovirus”, Osotimehin said the nation had quickly 
    stepped up efforts aimed at stopping the polio outbreak in northern 
    Nigeria through intensified eradication activities that ensured 
    vaccination of all children with the oral polio vaccine.
The 62nd WHA was assured that since the 61st WHA one year ago, 
    Nigeria has put in place important measures and have also recorded 
    commendable outcomes. Delegates 
    heared that Nigeria has implemented six rounds of enhanced 
    Supplemental Immunisation Activities (SIAs), three of which have 
    been national campaigns. He said the quality of these campaigns 
    show a steady improvement and the number of Local Government Areas 
    (LGAs) achieving 90 per cent coverage of polio increased to 627 
    during the March 2009 SIAs. As a result of the steady improvement 
    in quality of the SIAs, the number of unvaccinated children during 
    campaigns declined significantly.
On the revitalising the routine immunisation, the Minister said 
    efforts to improve routine immunisation performance are bearing 
    modest dividends and national routine OPV3 coverage increased from 
    47 per cent at the beginning of 2008 to 63 per cent in the first 
    quarter in 2009; a 75 per cent increase within 12 months.
Other pointers he gave include Acute Flaccid Paralysis 
    Surveillance. “In this regard, certification standard (AFP) 
    performance was maintained at national level and in all but one 
    state in 2008. At LGA level, 73 per cent of all LGAs in the country 
    met the two main AFP surveillance performance indicators. Both 
    national polio laboratories in the country located at Ibadan and 
    Maiduguri maintained WHO accreditation in 2008.”
On population immunity, the Minister recalled: “The improved 
    quality of immunisation activities has impacted positively on 
    population immunity. The proportion of non-polio AFP cases aged 
    6-35 months reported never to have received a single dose of OPV 
    declined from 15 per cent in 2006 to less than 5 per cent by the 
    first quarter of 2009.
“Similarly, the proportion of non-polio AFP cases aged 6-35 
    months that were reported to have received at least three dose of 
    OPV increased from 62 per cent in 2006 to 78 per cent by the first 
    quarter of 2009. The most dramatic improvement in population 
    immunity was registered in Kano , 
    where for the first time ever, the children never vaccinated, 
    reduced to less than 20 per cent.”

Cheers.
Hi Mazi ,
Merry Christmas and a prosperous new year mazi 
    . How are you doing?
Could you tell me why l cannot reach you with the phone number 
    you supplied me? l have added 00 to  using eurocity 
    card meant for W.Europe, USA and Canada 
    but was told that l was not allowed to reach this destination 
    (which cannot be true because a colleague reaches his Polish family 
    with it).
l'm waiting to hear from you soonest.
Cheers
Mazi ,
Thanks for your last mail. The dates you chose have sorted out 
    my troubles and confussion. 
    They have solved 's proposed 
    UK visit, even though he has not told me whether or not this 
    academic trip will enable him to see me. But I don't want to 
    take anything for granted. Whether he replies to my inquiry or not 
    has now been overtaken by events. Come any date in April now I will 
    be around, by God's grace. Then on May 10th, I will be 
    cracking jokes with you physically; take some strolls with you on 
    the 11th and on the 12th I will be headed home.
No, my human angel will not be travelling with me. I don't 
    want some uncalled-for attitudes. But the other angels will be my 
    bodyguards.
Please do not fail to let me know what to expect so that I will 
    start to prepare myself. First, I have been reliably informed that 
    I will need someone to take me from the airport since Polish 
    citizens on the roads or vehicles have no business with the 
    Queen's English.
Remain belssed as we keep in 
    touch.
Cheers.
Mazi ,
Please could you look at the dates below and tell me the one you 
    think will be good for you. The earlier I choose a date and make a 
    booking the cheaper the airfare becomes for me as 
    bro  
     is not forthcoming with the dates 
    he will be in the UK in April. I can't keep waiting for him 
    indefinitely, not even my voice mail has been responded to on his 
    return from Naija. It appears he is very 
    busy so I can't press him further on coming back.
The dates are: 23-25 April, 1-4, 10-12, 17-19 May. As it suits 
    you. If I spend one quality day with you it might help, isn't 
    it?
Cheers.
Mazi ,
Thanks for writing back so soon.
This age and times no longer require registration of business 
    for people to look for means of survival. How could you forget 
    this? I do not need a registration of those Ltds to buy a car from 
    Poland and send to Nigeria if we can find it cheaper there, or do 
    I? Yes, that is what I am talking about. Make your 
    inquries about what we can be 
    buying from there that are cheap and send to someone like 
      to dispose for us in 
    Lagos, take his cut, and send ours. Money? We can always use my 
    credit cards which I will keep repaying bit by bit if are sure of 
    some profit. We are not getting younger and retirement age is fast 
    approaching.
Thanks for your prompt invitation. I am actually thinking of 
    March/April so that I will recover from my US trip. If your 
    itinarary is ok in those 
    months, especially April you let me know.
Bless you. Thanks for your pic which 
    refused to get larger than the miniature.

Mazi ,
Bless you. Thanks for your mail at last.
It is true that I have become a traveller looking for any 
    international rather than local business. If you know what we could 
    get cheap in Poland and sell it elsewhere to make money please do 
    let me know.
The time being wasted doing one job and not realising anything 
    tangeable can be frustrating. I 
    have always told those who have the ear to listen that the Whiteman 
    has designed things such that you will eat and clothe yourself from 
    any job you do. Then pays all the taxes and bills and have little 
    or nothing to save at the end of the month. While this is happening 
    people home keep expecting you to send them elephants each 
    month.
So, I have decided to move around to see what to do. If it 
    clicks then the present job will go for good.
When you take a good look at the calender could you tell me the 
    month I could possibly check you up in 
     . When this is done I will also look at the suggested dates and 
    tell you how they run with my work roster which has been drawn to 
    the end of the year. I will spend two to three days with you.
Cheers and remain blessed.
 o.
Mazi ,
Happy New Year to you and to your family!
Thanks for your mail. It is good to read that you are ok and in 
    good spirit despite the sad situation at home, especially with 
    .
Did they stop your pay on the grounds that you have overstayed 
    the approved time?
How are you going about fighting the stopped salary? I know that 
    your physicalprescence will 
    make a difference but some brethren who are lecturers there can 
    also make some moves for you.
Your wife should be strong for you and for the children at this 
    time and pick up her healing from the Lord. I know it may be hard 
    for her but she does not need to give up at this eleventh hour when 
    you have made some in-roads already.
How is your programme progressing? What areas of breakthrough 
    with your acada at the moment?
I spent the Christmas period with the 
    s. He could not lay hands on your 
    number, we all would have said merry Christmas to you. My own phone 
    went dead as I did not take my charger with me else I would have 
    checked for your number.
I came back from  and picked up 
    some of those fevers and coughs and 
    cattarah that must have been hiding somewhere since I 
    returned from Nigeria. I have been out of job as a result for a 
    couple of days now. I dragged myself to check mails now.
Please do write again soon.
Bless you.

Mazi ,
Please accept our verbal Christmas card and greetings.
It is quite unfortunate that I have not come your way for a long 
    time now. I hope you have been hearing 
    form your wife and children? Do you have a last minute plan 
    to travel home in the next couple of days like you did last year or 
    is it two?
I was home in November and stayed for four weeks, returning on 
    the 18th of December. I produced some tracts for use by churches 
    and fellowships.
I shall say more on this later.
Cheers.
Mazi ,
Our spirit is one. As I was telling myself that it is long 
    overdue to do you a mail little did I know that you were already in 
    my mail box waiting for me.
Bless you real good. The Good Lord has always been faithful to 
    those who put their trust in Him.
My brother, I hope you are doing fine body, soul and spirit? 
    How bookuru? 
    Ma ndi ulo gi? God 
    will bring us together one day. I have applied for the oyibo 
    man's naturalisation. At the most it will take seven months to 
    materialise. They say the volume of application is great. That will 
    be followed with the application for the corresponding passport 
    after which I could travel with ease. The devil is fighting using 
    human agent to deny me the opportunity but the battle is the Lords. 
    By His grace, my hands are clean in not planning evil against 
    anyone therefore I am not afraid.
How is your work doing? Have you been learning Polish language? 
    I told my Polish colleagues that it might take me over 20 years to 
    learn the swiswiswi they speak here.
Please write again soon and speak much this time around.
Cheers
Mazi ,
Thanks a lot for your mail. God bless you real good.
I am happy that you have got some dates at your disposal. I took 
    a look at the visa requirement for Poland and was surprised that 
    one can even go to USA ten times over before one can receive Polish 
    visa. I hope to give you extracts of what I found out soonest.
The whole thing looks like a code which needs to be cracked. I 
    shall find a way though, even if it may take time. But by 
    God's grace I will see your face one day, God keeping us 
    alive.
""See you again soon""
Cheers
Mazi ,
It is nice reading from you. More importantly to know that you 
    are kicking fine like Nigeria's under 17 soccer world 
    conquerors. But I wish you are sharing from the bounties which the 
    country is showering on them.
I am happy that you are working hard to finish in record time. 
    The Lord will grant you that prayer in Jesus's name.
Yes I had always thought of retraining (not taught, as you put 
    it, since I am not sure of teaching). The problem really is that I 
    am not sure if I can raise the type of fees for education down here 
    after which one is not too sure of getting job with better pay as 
    our age continue to add. The youth now have an edge.
Is it like  
     who left the comforts of UNN and 
    took his family to settle in the US only to do all kinds of 
    minial jobs including working in 
    post office.
Someone who should have become a 
    prof long ago taking some good N200 000 and above per month. 
    When I heard of him last he was not even doing anything. The 
    brother I spoke with in the US two years ago was even promising him 
    a job to do care job with his clinic. I have considered the option 
    of teaching, with a view to training in PGDE to acqauint me fully 
    with the standard here. But one must produce evidence that one has 
    worked with children before of a particular age one desire to 
    teach. The process is like passing through the eye of a 
    niddle.
Mazi , it is really not the best 
    out in oyibo land.
If our country didn't turn out to be so corrupt how could 
    we all desire to leave home where our communal way of doing things 
    are more satisfying. Yes, we have electricity, water, good roads, 
    efficient transportation, jobs (no matter how poor) etc over here 
    but what about other things like relationship? How many people have 
    I visited this year and how many have been here? Maybe one or two. 
    (I was begging someone over a week ago so that I could visit their 
    family. It hasn't worked out). Is this it? What about 
    evangelism and all that? How many people are ready to give you one 
    minute to hear you preach to them? People at home think they are 
    missing heaven by not being abroad. But they don't know they 
    are not missing anything no matter how imperfect our systems may 
    really be.
Anyway, I do not know if I will say that I am confused as to 
    what to put my hands in. My wife has completed a degree and masters 
    degree in pharmacy yet no job for over a year now. Some two/three 
    weeks ago she was pursuing admission into the nursing profession. 
    Now she is frantically looking for job into anything. One of the 
    problems is that our tongue are not easily understood by the 
    average British. So how can you get a job when you cannot be easily 
    understood? Our closest White neighbour says she can understand me 
    but can hardly pick a word when my wife speaks. You must strain and 
    use no 6 to understand what this White lady is saying. I'm not 
    sure you have heard the Typical English person speak. I mean the 
    uneducated ones in particular. Don't mind the news readers. 
    Theirs look more like special English meant for everyone to 
    understand. I can go on and on. In any case, I will still be 
    praying for God to lead me into something that will be more 
    beneficial to me when I leave for home, God willing.
Have I entertained you?
Remain blessed.
Mazi ,
May the Good Lord continue to be your father even as you 
    continue to trust Him.
How are you doing brother, in faraway ? lt has been 
    long and I must apologise for not having knocked on your door all 
    this while.
First, I believe that your health is very much intact and that 
    your family is kept in touch with constantly.How are they doing?
What developments with your acada and teachers and researches? 
    Please keep me updated, including the job search. The last time we 
    spoke you promised to get me informed of any info geared towards 
    looking out for a vac job for you here 
    in the UK. Remember l promised to do all I can to help out if I 
    could get info about a non- 
    recident searching for job over here.
Please write soon.
Cheers

NigerianEnglish,could,The surgeon was actually secretly annoyed that such an ugly 'bed bug' could have managed to impregnate a beautiful girl like Agnes,epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,nov_14,"""You must be out of your mind!"" Sade shouted at her 
    friend in disbelief.
It was some weeks after her first affair with Leemy when Agnes 
    told Sade that she was getting married to Dr Leemy Bello. By now, 
    her pregnancy was getting much pronounced, with the early morning 
    sickness becoming repetitive and very nauseating for her. She had 
    tactically allowed about two weeks to elapse after her last visit 
    to Leemy before breaking the news of the pregnancy to the young 
    doctor. She had craftily suggested an abortion just to know the 
    doctor's reaction to this. Leemy who had been overjoyed at the 
    news of the pregnancy, quickly rejected the idea of an abortion. He 
    was particularly happy because he had achieved what he thought 
    impossible and with an additional bonus of a forthcoming baby, he 
    was almost beside himself with joy. He had therefore quickly 
    proposed to Agnes who gave her consent after some 
    'hesitation'.
""I will travel home immediately to inform my mother,"" 
    Leemy had said moments later.
He knew his mother would be proud of him for such a nice catch 
    just a few weeks after chiding him for not having a girlfriend. 
    Now, as Agnes tried to flatten her abdomen to allow the 
    Nurses' uniform to fit her, Sade stood glaring at her.
""I knew something was going wrong with you the moment you 
    started behaving strangely...are you actually serious that you want 
    to make that hideous-looking man your husband?"" she asked 
    dumbfounded.
""Please Sade, don't use such degrading terms to 
    describe my future husband,"" Agnes said in mock annoyance. 
    Sade broke into a fit of laughter.
""Mrs. Lamidi Bello!"" she hissed. ""Agnes, 
    I'm sure you're joking or has the man given you some love 
    potion to drink?""
After a few seconds silence, Agnes went up to her friend and 
    placed a hand on her shoulder.
""Sade, do you notice any change in me of recent?"" Sade 
    silently looked her friend up and down, frowned and shook her 
    head.
""You call yourself a nurse and you can't even detect a 
    pregnant woman?"" Agnes remarked.
""You're what?...Oh, all those early morning trips to 
    the toilet. It never occurred to me,"" Sade cried as she moved 
    closer to her girlfriend for a proper examination.
""My God, you really are pregnant! But... but, is it 
    Lamidi's baby?"" she asked.
""Please call him Leemy, not Lamidi,"" Agnes replied.
""Okay whose baby is it?"" Sade asked looking 
    suspicious.
""It's Leemy's, of course.""
""But that's impossible ... I mean it can't be. I 
    understand he can't do anything ... he's said to be 
    impotent.""
Suddenly, Agnes' countenance hardened up and she turned 
    sharply to her friend.
""How did you know about that?""
""So you mean you didn't know? It's all over the 
    hospital,"" Sade replied tersely.
""That's not correct. It's not correct!"" was 
    all Agnes could say before she burst into tears.
Hot tears poured out of her eyes and she covered her face with 
    her nurses' cap sobbing convulsively for about two minutes.
Sade was alarmed at this for she had always thought Agnes to be 
    so tough that nothing could make her cry.
""My God Agnes I'm really sorry. I never meant to be 
    rude or upset you. I was only telling you what people have been 
    saying,"" Sade said as she moved to his friend's side. 
    ""I never knew you were serious. I'm sorry if I made you 
    sad.""
""Oh Sade. I'm such a fool. I've made a mess of 
    myself,"" Agnes said between sobs.
""There is no mess. If you love him and it's his baby 
    then you haven't done anything wrong,"" Sade said trying 
    to soothe her depressed friend.
After a while, Agnes dried her tears.
""Sade, please promise me you'll keep this strictly 
    between the two of us.""
Sade nodded.
""A.. .Actually, it's not Leemy's baby.""
""What!"" Sade cried. ""Then, why do you want to 
    marry him? Who is the baby's father?""
""I... I don't really know,"" Agnes said bursting 
    into fresh tears.
This time, Sade allowed her to cry for a while. She 
    couldn't understand what had come over her friend. Agnes went 
    on crying for a few more minutes before she finally controlled 
    herself and dried her tears. Then, she told her friend 
    everything.
""But you think he won't know the truth later?"" 
    Sade asked afterwards.
""No. There is no way he can know. It's only about two 
    months difference.""
Sade thought over this for a while.
""Supposing it's that white musician's baby?"" 
    she asked.
""I hope not. He told me he was using some preventive 
    tablets and I believed him so I didn't use anything myself. I 
    just pray the tablets were genuine and that it's not his 
    baby"" she said, her eyes moist with the beginning of another 
    flood of tears.
Sade was quiet for a while, thinking. She couldn't remember 
    ever knowing any birth control pills for men.
""But why didn't you think of abortion?""
""My doctor advised against it. You know how I almost died 
    when I had the last one?""
Sade nodded in agreement as she remembered how her friend had 
    spent an extra two months in the hospital after her last 
    abortion.
Suddenly, she too became overwhelmed by the whole situation and 
    burst into tears. She clasped her friend's hand and said 
    between sobs.
""I... I don't know what to say. It doesn't look 
    right... but... but in the present circumstances. I don't know 
    of any other solution.""
The two friends clung to each other for a while.
""When is the wedding coming up?"" Sade asked when the 
    two girls had fully composed themselves.
""That's pretty near, isn't it?""
""Yes. I understand our results will be out in two 
    weeks' time. By that time, the invitation cards would have 
    been out. I'm sure that with the announcement of my wedding, 
    the Matron should give me my certificate, and since Dr Bello is a 
    senior member of staff in the hospital, I should automatically be 
    employed to work here.""
There was a few seconds of silence before Agnes spoke.
""Sade?"" she said.
""Yes?""
""Please promise that all I told you about the pregnancy 
    will be kept secret.""
""I promise. You can always trust me with such 
    things.""
""Thanks, Sade. You don't know how relieved I feel 
    after telling you everything. I hope you don't mind being my 
    Chief bridesmaid.""
""Is that so? That's very nice of you. Thanks for the 
    offer,"" Sade said suddenly feeling ecstatic about the 
    possibility of a wedding ceremony. She suddenly felt happier.
""Come, Agnes we have to hurry to get to the ward. We shall 
    discuss more about the preparations for the wedding.""
The two girls quickly got dressed and walked to their respective 
    wards for the day's duties.
It was later that night that Leemy broke the news to his Friend 
    Jimi Gomez. He had been busy throughout that day as it was the 
    operation day in the department of surgery. The young man had 
    arrived in the theatre in a cheerful mood greeting everybody he 
    came across, from the patients to the porters. Twice during an 
    operation, while assisting Dr Boniface, his mind had wandered away. 
    He could see Agnes, radiant in her wedding dress while he too was 
    looking smart in his new suit. As the photographer's camera 
    flashed, he remembered to smile...
""Bello! What's come over you? I told you to cut, 
    instead you just stand there grinning,"" the voice of his 
    consultant jolted him back to reality.
""Sorry sir. I didn't hear you.""
""Or have you won a lottery, or something? You've had 
    that stupid grin plastered on your face since morning,"" the 
    surgeon added.
Leemy, who was not sure how Dr Boniface would take the news of 
    his impending wedding to one of the consultant's girlfriends 
    only smiled and kept his eyes on the operation table. Twice after 
    that, he had accidentally dropped two surgical instruments on the 
    floor much to the annoyance of Dr Boniface who muttered something 
    about the evil effect of liquor on a doctor's concentration 
    ability. The surgeon later remembered to advise the young doctor 
    about sleeping well the night before the operation day. As soon as 
    he finished his job in the ward, Leemy hurried to seek out his 
    friend. He did not mind that he was limping as he hurriedly walked 
    to the doctors' quarters.
""Hello Leemy. Anything the matter?"" Jimi asked as his 
    friend burst into his flat where he was having supper.
""Sorry, boy for crashing in like this,"" Leemy said 
    trembling with excitement. ""I'm ... getting 
    married.""
""What? Marriage? To whom?"" Jimi asked in alarm.
""Agnes, of course.""
Jimi thought his friend must have been drinking. Though he was 
    happy that Leemy was now getting on fine with Agnes, he never 
    thought things would go this far. Leemy was however not yet 
    finished with his message. His face was radiant.
""She's pregnant. I mean . . . she's carrying my 
    baby,"" he added breathlessly.
Suddenly Jimi knew something was wrong. Agnes was not the kind 
    of girl to get pregnant . . . unless, may be she had no choice. 
    Again, the haste with which she had allowed Leemy to take her to 
    bed was baffling. In fact, from Leemy's account of what 
    happened, it was as if Agnes actually raped the boy on the first 
    occasion.
""Jimi, Jimi, you can't even congratulate me,"" 
    Leemy suddenly said, jolting his friend out of his thoughts.
""How old is the pregnancy?"" Jimi asked instead of 
    congratulating his friend.
""Just a month old. Why do you ask?""
Jimi now found it difficult to meet his friend's eyes. He 
    coughed nervously before saying,
""Leemy, I'm ... I'm not doubting you but, are you 
    really sure of what is happening?""
""Sure of what ... of Agnes or the fact that we are going to 
    get married?"" Leemy asked, the annoyance visible on his 
    face.
""Both. Somehow, I don't really think everything is 
    going on right... I... I... mean Agnes is not the type of girl to 
    rush into marriage like this. Maybe we should talk this over before 
    you go ahead. Somehow, I think there is something fishy about the 
    whole thing.""
Leemy did not reply. He only turned his back on his friend.
""You were the last person I thought would try to hurt me. 
    Are you trying to say that I'm not worthy of the 
    girl?""
Leemy's utterance baffled Jimi who quickly got up and went 
    up to his friend.
""Not at all Leemy. It's just that the girl has other 
    boy-friends. How do you know the baby is yours? Especially since 
    you can't..."" Jimi couldn't finish the sentence as 
    his voice trailed off.
Leemy faced his friend, his face screwed up in a seething 
    rage.
""Go on ... finish up! What did you want to say ... that I 
    can't do anything? That I'm impotent?""
He was now screaming and sweating profusely.
""Go on say it. I knew you were jealous. Jealous of the fact 
    that a cripple could get such a beautiful girl. Jealous of 
    my...""
Suddenly he stopped and broke into tears as he collapsed into 
    the cushion chair.
Jimi allowed him to sob for a while before moving near him. He 
    held his friend by the shoulder.
""I'm sorry Leemy. I never meant to hurt you. I never 
    said you're impotent. What I wanted to say is that you 
    can't prove that the pregnancy is yours.""
After a while, Leemy stopped sobbing. At that moment, Jimi did 
    not consider it appropriate to press him for more details about the 
    pregnancy.
""Come, Leemy. Accept my hearty congratulations. I wish you 
    the best of luck?""
""Jimi?""
""Yes.""
""Will you be my best man?""
""Of course. I'll love to do it. Where will the wedding 
    take place?""
""At the University's chapel in a month's 
    time,"" Leemy replied, his countenance now brighter.
The news of the impending wedding soon spread all over the 
    hospital with the quickness of a forest fire during the dry season. 
    Everywhere it went, it generated the same reaction - spontaneous 
    disbelief. In the nurses' hostel, most of the girls knew Agnes 
    was too glamorous to go and marry such a drab-looking doctor like 
    Dr Bello. Most of the girls therefore suspected something fishy in 
    the arrangement but couldn't lay their hands on what it was. 
    As for the medical students, news quickly got to them that Agnes 
    was only pushing an unwanted pregnancy to the doctor. The source of 
    this fact was Larry Okon, who had earlier rejected the disputed 
    pregnancy. Gradually, this piece of news floated to the ears of 
    Leemy's friends who quickly called and advised against the 
    wedding. Leemy's mind was however made up and he only thought 
    his friends were envious of his success at getting the hand of a 
    beautiful girl in marriage. He was also of the opinion that his 
    friends had all along, probably thought he was impotent. Thus, 
    instead of changing his mind about the pregnancy, he became more 
    determined to go ahead with the wedding.
After his previous experience with Leemy, Jimi did not try to 
    discourage his friend again. He knew Leemy was already irredeemably 
    caught in Agnes' webs.
""Congratulations Doc. I know that with your brains, you 
    deserve only the best of everything,"" Dr Boniface had told 
    Leemy on receiving the invitation card for the wedding. The surgeon 
    was actually secretly annoyed that such an ugly 'bed bug' 
    could have managed to impregnate a beautiful girl like Agnes. It 
    made him all the more unhappy that his chain of beautiful 
    girlfriends was reduced by one. At any rate, Dr Boniface still 
    accepted to be the chairman at the wedding reception.
Leemy travelled home to llorin on a weekend to tell his mother 
    and relations about the impending big event. His mother was happy 
    on hearing the news and quickly informed her relations and friends. 
    Her joy was not even dampened when she learnt that Agnes, an Ibo 
    girl, was not from their own Igbira tribe. And when she learnt that 
    the girl was already pregnant, her joy knew no bounds as the 
    thought of being a grandmother overwhelmed her.
When Agnes gave Leemy the list of the items to be bought for the 
    wedding including the cash gifts to her relatives as bride price, 
    he almost collapsed.
""This is nothing. You should consider yourself lucky,"" 
    Agnes replied. ""If not for the fact that my parents have been 
    living in Lagos for a long time, we would have had to go to our 
    village for the wedding. Then, you'd have paid through the 
    nose.""
So, Dr Bello was forced to raise loans from friends within and 
    outside the hospital to the tune of five thousand naira for the 
    wedding ceremony. Some of his consultants, including Dr Boniface, 
    also lent him some money. About a week to the wedding, the 
    nurses' examination results were released and Agnes passed, 
    much to the surprise of her friends.
And, in view of her impending wedding, she was given employment 
    in the hospital as a staff nurse in the paediatrics ward. She was 
    very happy because this was what she had always prayed for.

The Federal Government is yet to identify Nigerians who 
    benefited from the $180million Halliburton bribery scandal.
The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of 
    Justice, Mr. Michael Aondoakaa (SAN) made the clarification 
    in a letter to the President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), 
    Chief Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), on the status of the ongoing 
    probe into the scam.
In the letter, which was exclusively obtained by The 
    Nation, the AGF said Nigeria is exploring Mutual Legal 
    Assistance Treaty with the United States and Switzerland to unmask 
    the bribe-takers.
The letter reads: ""I wish to draw your esteem attention to 
    the above subject and to intimate you on the efforts being made by 
    the Federal Government of Nigeria to obtain relevant information 
    about the involvement of Nigerians in the Halliburton bribery 
    scandal.
""It will be recalled that the Federal Government recently 
    commenced investigation into a case of suspected criminal 
    conspiracy among Nigerian government officials, other Nigerians, 
    all yet to be identified and foreign nationals, to obtain a 
    contract for construction of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities 
    in exchange for gratifications.
""The investigation evolved from the case of United States 
    of America v Stanley-Case No. 4: 08-cr-00597-1, US District 
    Court for the Southern District of Texas, as a result of the 
    conviction of one Albert Stanley Jackson, a US citizen resident in 
    Houston, Texas for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
    (FCPA).
""According to the Court records, on the 3rd of September, 
    2008, Stanley, a former officer and director of Kellogg, Brown and 
    Root, Inc, a global engineering and construction services company 
    based in Houston, Texas, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate 
    the FCPA in connection with a scheme to bribe Nigerian government 
    officials in order to obtain Engineering, Procurement, and 
    Construction contracts worth over US$6billion.
""By pleading guilty to the charges, Mr. Stanley 
    acknowledged that he and his co-conspirators wilfully agreed to 
    make improper payments to Nigerian officials to ensure support that 
    the Joint Venture obtain and retain contracts in connection with 
    the LNG project. Mr. Stanley was sentenced to seven years in 
    prison in addition to payment of restitution in the amount of 
    US$250,000.
""Although the court records that could reveal the identity 
    of the Nigerians involved in the bribery scandal is yet to be 
    de-classified by the US Courts, the Federal Government is 
    determined to prosecute all the participants in this case of 
    corruption wherever they may be located, to the full extent of the 
    Nigerian law.
""In order to ensure that evidence necessary to sustain the 
    charge is obtained, a request for mutual legal assistance in 
    criminal matters has been made to the US Attorney-General and the 
    Government of Switzerland.
""Mr. President has also constituted an Investigation 
    Panel comprising the Director-General of State Security Services

    the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) 
    with the Inspector-General of Police (IG) as Chairman.
""Government expects to receive the necessary cooperation 
    from the various countries whose assistance has been sought. It is 
    also our hope that the Investigation Panel will be able to uncover 
    the evidence required to prosecute those involved in the bribery 
    scandal.
""It has become pertinent to inform you of these 
    developments and to solicit your support as well as that of the Bar 
    in complementing the efforts so far made by the Government. This is 
    in view of the realisation that the Bar under your able leadership 
    can play a key role in complementing and supporting ongoing efforts 
    to rid our society of corruption.""
It was learnt that the government decided to reach out to the 
    NBA leadership to prevail on its members for understanding when the 
    list of the bribe-takers is released.
The AGF, who also spoke with The Nation, said 
    the government would collaborate with the NBA on the probe.
Aondoakaa said: ""I have written officially to the NBA 
    President who has acknowledged it for collaboration because they 
    have to give us all the assistance.
""This is something that is very germane and when we 
    gathered this evidence, we need their support. In as much as the 
    lawyers need to make their fees, there is the need to take national 
    interest into consideration. And the response of the NBA President 
    is very cordial.""
Also yesterday, the All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) urged the 
    Okiro-led panel not to compromise.
The party, in a statement signed by its National Publicity 
    Secretary Emma Eneukwu, said it learnt that efforts by the panel to 
    get the list of Nigerian officials involved in the bribe have been 
    futile
ANPP said though, the US about a month ago, pledged to allow the 
    panel access to some documents that might hasten its work, the 
    party, however, said it was doubtful if the panel followed the 
    right step in getting the documents.
The party advised President Umaru Yar'Adua to compel the 
    Okiro-led panel to get the documents from US at all costs.
It said former President Olusegun Obasanjo and former Head of 
    State General Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd) under whose tenure the 
    scam was perpetrated should be interrogated by the panel.

NigerianEnglish,could,"It has gone beyond the enunciation of policy statements to embrace the details that only practitioners could work out (Nkangwung, 1994)",dynamic,epistemic,dynamic,Adm_03,"Special Education Policies in Nigeria
The genesis of special education 
    -the modification of regular education to enable the 
    handicapped to derive benefit from it - could be traced to the 
    establishment of the first school for the blind in Kano by the 
    Sudan Interior Mission (SIM) in the early forties. Between 1953 and 
    the outbreak of the Nigeria Civil War, more schools for the 
    handicapped, particularly those for the visually handicapped, the 
    hearing impaired and the mentally retarded, were established in 
    different parts of the country. This first generations of 
    institutions for the handicapped, according to Obani (1989), were 
    largely the result of efforts of dedicated Christians propelled by 
    missionary zeal. They charted the course of special education and 
    recorded modest successes with the 
    meagerresources and the small subventions from the federal 
    and regional governments. Their devotion, indefatigable spirit and 
    tenacity of purpose, largely compensated for the poor funding and 
    inadequacy of equipment. The role of the government was minimal 
    during this phase of development. There was no clear-cut policy of 
    government except, a few terse provision of dormant legislations in 
    some parts of the country (Obani, 1989). The education of the 
    handicapped according to Obani was treated as a welfare service 
    rather than a national investment and as a 
    priviledge rather than a duty 
    for government.
With the end of the civil war in 1970 came the oil boom and the 
    second phase of development of education for the handicapped. The 
    government started to play an increasing role in the special 
    education sector. This resulted in the establishment of many 
    schools for the handicapped in all the states of the federation, 
    but many without proper planning and adequate staffing. Moreover, 
    departments for the training of special educators were established 
    in both Ibadan and Jos universities. The Federal College for 
    special education was also established.
Another important phenomenon of this phase is the enunciation of 
    a definite policy on special education contained in Section 8 of 
    the National Policy on Education (1977), revised in (1981).
In this section, the purpose of special education is clearly 
    stated and this includes the provision of adequate education for 
    all handicapped children and adults so that they can contribute to 
    national development (para. 55 b), the policy also 
    identifies integration as the most realistic form of special 
    education since handicapped children are eventually expected to 
    live in the society (para. 56(5).
The Philosophy of Special Education
The National Policy on Education has these as the purpose and 
    objectives of special education:
(a) To give concrete meaning to the ideas of equalising 
    educational opportunities for all children, their physical, mental, 
    emotional disabilities not-withstanding.
(b) To provide adequate education for all handicapped children 
    and adults in order that they may fully play their roles in the 
    development of the nation.
(c) To provide opportunities for exceptionally gifted children 
    to develop at their own pace in the interest of the nation's 
    economic and technological development.
Section 8 of the policy highlighted governments intention in 
    this form:
(1) Sub section 56 (1) the Federal Government will set up a 
    committee to co-ordinate Special Education activities in 
    collaboration with the Ministries of Health, Social Welfare and 
    Labour.
(2) A census will be taken of all handicapped children and 
    adults by age, sex, locality and type.
(3) The government accepts the responsibility for making 
    provision for training teachers in Special Education as well as the 
    supportive staff required by the school, colleges, clinics and 
    centres in this area.
(4) The government has decided that integration is the most 
    realistic form of Special Education, since handicapped children are 
    eventually expected to live in the society.
(5) The education of the handicapped will be free at all levels, 
    up to the University level where possible.
(6) Vocational schools will be made to reserve places for 
    further education of handicapped children and adults - government 
    will provide suitable employment opportunities for the handicapped 
    workers.
(7) Children clinic will be attached to most hospitals for early 
    identification of the handicapped children, and for curative 
    measures and medical care before and after the age of primary 
    schooling.
(8) Ministries of Health, Education, Social Welfare, Social 
    Development and Labour will work jointly on most programmes for 
    handicapped children, and the National Council on Special Education 
    will be composed to reflect this collective responsibility.
Strengths of the Policy
There is no doubt that this policy which has identified central 
    issues in special education has some strengths.
1. The National Policy on Education (NPE) represents the most 
    comprehensive and most far-reaching education policy ever devised 
    in Nigeria. This view finds support from Thakur (1983), Nwaogu 
    (1988), Osokoya (1989) and Nkangwung (1994). Thakur (1983), for 
    instance, described it as the first comprehensive document produced 
    since the beginning of the Western type of schooling in Nigeria. 
    Education policies before now, as Nkangwung (1994) puts it, had 
    limited concern geographically and in the programmes. Unlike the 
    previous policies, this new policy was developed in Nigeria by 
    Nigerians to cater for the needs of Nigerians.
2. It also represents an articulation between education and 
    national objectives. The policy sees education as a means for 
    achieving national objectives which are identified as the building 
    of:
• a free and democratic society
• a just and egalitarian society
• a united, strong and self-reliant nation
• a great and dynamic economy
• a land of bright and full opportunities
for all citizens (NPE, 1981). Both in concept and design, this 
    new system can be seen as a radical departure from the former 
    British implemented education system in Nigeria which was guided by 
    the imperial utilitarian considerations (Osokoya, 1989).
3. Education is seen as a right of the citizen not a 
    priviledge of the few.
4. Also noteworthy about the policy is the fact that we have for 
    the first time in Nigeria an education policy and practice that are 
    based on a definite social philosophy. This is important because 
    the planning for an appropriate education of any society should be 
    done in relation to the social ideals - philosophy of the society 
    in question (Nkangwung, 1994).
5. Another strength of the policy and perhaps the most relevant 
    for the purpose of this paper, is its provision for the education 
    of exceptional children. The purpose and objectives of special 
    education are clearly stated in Section 8 (55) while Section 8 (56) 
    specifies the ways and means by which the government intends to 
    achieve the stated objectives. Nwaogu (1988) also reported that the 
    National Policy on Education envisages that:
(a) Special Education will lead to early detection of students 
    with learning problems.
(b) Identification will lead to early intervention.
(c) It will help to provide adequate knowledge of a child's 
    characteristics, aptitudes, interests, strength and weaknesses and 
    ensure adaptation of materials and programme to the benefit of the 
    student.
(d) The intervention may focus on remedial or compensatory 
    education.
(e) Knowledge about the causes of handicapped conditions and 
    their attendant learning problems will help bring about changes in 
    people's attitudes that are rooted in ignorance and 
    superstition.
(f) The use of individualized instruction methods will ensure 
    proper selection of materials, assessment criteria evaluation and 
    grading.
(g) Teachers to be produced for Special Education are those who 
    have vision, who are responsive, perceptive, alert and thorough in 
    their duties towards children.
Weaknesses of the Policy
1. The aims of education are not consistent at all levels of 
    education, for example, national integration is an aim of education 
    only at the secondary level.
2. There is too much presence of government in the policy with 
    the result that private initiative is stifled.
3. Another inconsistency in the policy is the area of support or 
    control of education. At the pre-primary level, the policy allows 
    for private participation while the primary level largely enjoys 
    public control. The control at the secondary level is both private 
    and public but at the tertiary level only public participation is 
    allowed. If there is value in private participation in education, 
    it should run through all levels of education (Adedoja and 
    Ajobiewe, 1996).
4. The policy has taken more than the Nigerian government can 
    achieve. It has gone beyond the enunciation of policy statements to 
    embrace the details that only practitioners could work out 
    (Nkangwung, 1994).
Implementation - Main Issues
It is apparent that Section 8 provides the directional policies 
    of special education in Nigeria. It is a well-intended policy which 
    has not been pragmatically pursued (Obiakor, Maltby and Ihunnah, 
    1990). Recent studies by Ihunnah (1984) and Oluigbo (1985) have 
    made salient revelations. Ihunnah (1984) for instance, used a 
    survey research design methodology to study improvements in special 
    education facilities, enrolment, and manpower in Nigeria. His 
    discoveries included the following:
• There has been an increase in the number of qualified teaching 
    personnel in special education. Student's enrolment is not 
    commensurate with teacher preparation.
• Established mechanisms for policy implementation are not 
    consistently enforced.
• There is a lack of specialised consultants and qualified 
    educational planners in strategic areas etc.
Co-ordination
In 1976, the Federal Ministry of Education gave the following 
    provisional guidelines to states: State Ministries of Education 
    should be responsible for Special Education programmes in their 
    states, this is to include planning, supervision, and finance (FME 
    circular, 1976). However, there is no record to show that the 
    committee has been formed. The implication is that programmes for 
    the disabled in Nigeria remain uncoordinated. (Adedoja & 
    Ajobiewe, 1996).
Census
Another important clause in the National Policy concerns the 
    need for a census of all handicapped children and adults and the 
    attaching of children's clinics to most hospitals for early 
    identification of handicapped children, and the provision of 
    curative measures and medical care. The 1991 census figure revealed 
    that Nigeria has a population of 88.5 million. Using the 
    United Nations projection of one in every ten persons in a 
    population to be disabled, it is estimated that there are 8.8 million disabled Nigerians. However, there is no breaking of 
    this figure to each category of the handicapped. A critical 
    examination of the policy revealed that there was no structured 
    programmes or provision for the early detention of handicaps in 
    Nigerian children, and although some routine health programmes do 
    identify and refer a few cases, there was a general lack of special 
    facilities and personnel for early detection and treatment of 
    individuals with handicap. As regards the children's clinics, 
    only very few isolated cases were recorded. Some supportive 
    services to the handicapped and their families are available 
    through child guidance clinics in few states, e.g. 
    Lagos State. These are obviously inadequate.
Integration issue
Despite the laudable intentions expressed nearly two decades 
    ago, integration of exceptional children cannot be said to have 
    achieved any considerable success in Nigeria. The apparent failure 
    of integration, as Nkangwung (1994) puts it, has affected special 
    education adversely. According to the author, not only has it 
    deprived our special children, especially in the rural areas who 
    have no access to the few special school located mainly in the 
    cities, the opportunity and the advantages derivable from 
    integration. It is better that the handicapped children are not 
    uprooted from their homes, families and communities. The government 
    should do much more to encourage integration schemes; it is 
    essential that they take root and flourish if the vast majority of 
    Nigeria's handicapped children are to receive any 
    education.

“Optic Fiber Vs Wireless” Chris Uwaje _ with contribution from 
    Roland Alden.“ However, in the developing economies where network 
    construction is viewed in context as an investment in the economy 
    and driver of economic growth, this view is 180′ out of synch.
Network construction in these environments should be optimized 
    to enable the maximum amount of opportunity along and adjacent the 
    network route. For example, in the “cost” view model of network 
    construction the need for reliable electricity at a regeneration 
    point is viewed as a negative input that must be compensated for by 
    either 1) costly construction or by 2) fancy electronics that allow 
    the “powerless” region to be traversed without stopping.
In the “development model” the need to provide an oasis of 
    electricity and infrastructure along the network route is also an 
    opportunity to enable an economic environment that will create 
    network customers over the long term. Furthermore, this investment 
    in a “micro economy” lowers the cost of providing service to 
    possibly larger economies elsewhere on the network.
This view of network construction is not common in telecom but 
    is the norm for other networks, such as roads and waterworks.
In many large countries it is not at all uncommon to travel on a 
    long, nearly deserted highway only to find gas stations at 
    amazingly regular intervals which provide the fuel that makes the 
    highway into an economically useful resource. No one builds special 
    purpose vehicles equipped with gigantic fuel tanks that make such 
    gas stations unnecessary.
Typically a small economy may grow up around such a gas station; 
    at a minimum one large enough to sustain the gas station itself but 
    typically one which might further leverage the investment such as 
    mechanized farms, irrigation pumps, a small airport and perhaps a 
    regional healthcare facility. The value of the gas station to the 
    adjacent economies that it nourishes can easily be doubled simply 
    by locating it at the intersection of two highways instead of 
    alongside only one.
Using this example it is easy to see that the “topology” of 
    human trade routes and living patterns guides so much 
    “infrastructure” development. Telecom development follows these 
    patterns to the degree that they must but there are two 
    externalities that have significantly distorted the evolution of 
    telecom. First, there is regulation.
The development of cities, settled areas, roads and trade routes 
    were largely subject to the kind of narrowly focused grants of 
    monopoly seen in telecom. Secondly, the use of technology to 
    attempt to “by pass” small and 
    large blocks of humanity in order to communicate across, over, 
    around and through them is somewhat unique to telecom.
The combination of wireless technology and Africa is often 
    painted as a logically synergistic combination. Large areas that 
    have historically been poorly served by dysfunction monopoly PTTs, 
    poverty that argues for a cheap and “quick fix” solution.
I often hear arguments to the effect that “since Africa is 
    different” …a different approach logically follows. As long as the 
    first postulate goes unchallenged the second assertion gets an 
    intellectual free ride that it does not deserve.
In making the case for fiber in Africa I’d like to argue that 
    Africa is *not* different and that the Africa we see today proves 
    that, if we’d only see it with open eyes.
It would be a tragedy to not apply lessons from other parts of 
    the world which could be used to make Africa 
    telecom_rich simply because 
    of a mistaken notion that somehow Africa is “different” and has to 
    underwrite a costly discovery of its own rules.“

Majority of children with behavioural, attention, 
    language, communication and learning disabilities such as autism 
    are not being identified early enough. But an organisation has 
    decided to see how it could put smiles on the faces of parents in 
    the care of such children, writes Funmi 
    
    Ogundare
Master Chidiebere Nwankwo, (not real name) the second in a 
    family of five, was born like any normal child, but at a stage when 
    he was supposed to be doing things just like his peers, he started 
    exhibiting strange behaviour such as having difficulty with 
    sleeping, eating and toileting, not responding to his name when 
    called, showing an unusual reaction to pain or pleasure, deaf to 
    loud sounds but affected by quiet noises, among others.
With these numerous challenges, his parents got very worried and 
    had to take him to a pediatrician for medical checkup. They were 
    advised to take him to a neuro-surgeon who diagnosed him as 
    autistic.
According to researchers, the disorder is related to over 
    excitability at nerve endings and mostly affects more males than 
    females. To this end, the Zammarr Institute, a non-governmental 
    organisation that supports children with developmental and learning 
    disabilities recently organised a one-day training workshop on 
    ‘Understanding Children on the Autistic Spectrum 
    Disorders: Implication for Families and Teachers.’ 
    The parley was for parents, teachers and social workers.
Founder of the institute, Mrs. Ronke Katagum said more 
    awareness is now being created so that people could be informed 
    about the disorder. She added that it was fast growing and there is 
    no known cure for it. She said, with behavioural intervention and 
    bio-medicals, it would go a long way in ameliorating the problems 
    associated with the disorder.
Asked what spurred her into working with autistic children, she 
    said, “It has been a long standing dream to work with the mentally 
    challenged children. People do associate them with distress and 
    their needs are not being met. I started 1997 by taking courses in 
    area of autism and today I am better for it.”
Katagum called on stakeholders to pay attention to autism, 
    saying, “it does not have a face and a child with autism may look 
    like you and I in most cases. He may be the next president as long 
    as he has the opportunity of getting early intervention which is 
    the key.”
The disorder according to International Development Director, 
    Autism Speaks United Kingdom, Mrs. Eileen Hopkins, is a 
    spectrum of developmental disorders involving impairment in 
    language, social behaviour and certain physical behaviors - with 
    symptoms that range widely in number and severity. She said it had 
    been attributed to biomedical factors such as allergies; vaccines, 
    genetic factors and neuro-developmental factors among others.
She added that parents of children with the disorder may have 
    worries about their child’s development, but should ‘come to terms’ with it, as soon as he or she is 
    diagnosed. Hopkins said people with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder 
    (ASD) usually have difficulties in three areas which included 
    social communication, interaction and imagination. With social 
    communication, she said the child might have difficulty in 
    understanding the social meaning of language and processing words, 
    be very anxious and would be unable to work out what one says or 
    means, not be able to make sense of jokes or sarcasm, misinterpret 
    body language, among others.
On the social imagination, she said the child usually have a 
    poor theory of mind, not understanding the consequence of his 
    actions and not having the flexibility of thought.
In the area of communication, Hopkins said the differences 
    include having less understanding of how to react and behave with 
    other people, and knowing how to use the signs, words and gestures, 
    as well as non-verbal method of communication.
She said teachers should be informed of his or her condition in 
    terms of social interaction and communication, adding, “a 
    child may have difficulties with reading, writing, number work or 
    understanding information, expressing themselves or understanding 
    what others are saying. There should be an Individual Education 
    Plan (IEP) to support them. Some children will benefit from extra 
    support from a Learning Support Assistant (LSA), which can help in 
    lessons and at break/lunchtimes.”
Hopkins noted that the teacher could also take reasonable steps 
    to ensure that the child is not put at a substantial disadvantage 
    and treated less favourably for a reason related to his or her 
    disability.
In helping children with the disorder, Hopkins, emphasised need 
    to increase the efficacy and range of treatment options available, 
    focus on biomedical and technological methods of treatments and 
    interventions.
A parent, Mrs. Aishatu Tukur said maintaining a child 
    with such problems could be very expensive, which requires one to 
    keep on re-assessing them by talking to the doctor, doing more 
    research that would guide them into taking good care of such 
    children. She said if one has to mainstream the autistic children 
    into the regular school, there is a need for parents to inform the 
    school of their situation, adding that it would do no good if they 
    are kept at home.
Another parent who does not want his name in print said it has 
    been very challenging taking care of his second son who was born 
    with the disorder. He said so far, he has been paying a special 
    teacher to cater for him at home. The workshop, he admitted is an 
    eye opener as it would give him more knowledge on steps to better 
    take care for his son. He emphasised the need for parents to give 
    them special attention rather than leaving them on their own.

NigerianEnglish,could,I could not go back to Ilesha because they thought my grandmother Oni Eleran would be unable to cope with me,dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,nov_07,"My Early Childhood
Shouldn't my mother, Dejubee, be the first person I was 
    aware of in my life, beside my good self? Funny enough she was not 
    the first person I remember knowing in my childhood days at our 
    quarter, Ikoti, in Ilesha. It was my paternal grandfather, Loogun 
    Falekun, the Ashipa of Ikoti. The little I remembered about him was 
    the terrible pain he periodically inflicted on me in the process of 
    scraping my head bare of hair. Most of the pain was concentrated at 
    the back of my head, at the junction of the neck and the head. The 
    instrument of torture was a piece of steel, probably under a foot 
    long, but to my child's eye it was very long indeed.
Next I remember my paternal grandmother, Yeye Oni Eleran, the 
    third name indicating her occupation of trading in sheep and goats 
    in the market. She used to take me to the market at Itakogun. But 
    apparently she soon decided to wean me off her and the market. One 
    day she set off for the market without me. Shortly after, I decided 
    to follow after her. I had not gone far from home when I lost my 
    bearing, neither knowing the way forward to the market nor backward 
    to our house. I do not know what good Samaritan brought me to my 
    grandmother Yeye but I do recall the flogging I got for disobeying 
    Yeye and following after her to the market when she had told me to 
    stay at home.
Then what apparently was an important event to Yeye happened at 
    Ishokun, another quarter at Ilesha. Her younger daughter Aina had 
    her first baby, a boy. Yeye had to relocate temporarily to Ishokun 
    to look after my Aunt Aina and her baby, and she had to take me 
    along as no one would look after me at Ikoti without Yeye. On the 
    second or third night in our new place an army of soldier ants 
    invaded the house, to the consternation of everyone except the new 
    baby. That new baby is my cousin Afolabi Alatise. There was nobody 
    around educated enough to record the day he was born. I reckon I 
    was about four years old at the time, and since I was born in 1918, 
    I put his year of birth as 1922.
Something happened to my grandfather that made the whole 
    household go into festivities for three days. Grandfather was not 
    moving around but everybody was milling around him. It was a 
    continuing feasting, and we kids liked it. On the third day 
    Grandfather, who all the time was not talking or moving, was being 
    wrapped in several bales of cloth. Even young as I was I knew this 
    could not do him much good. Then when the body was being lowered 
    into a pit that had been dug apparently for the purpose, I had no 
    doubt in my mind that the people lowering Grandfather into the pit 
    were committing an unfriendly act and that therefore it was time 
    for those who loved him to rise up to the challenge. So I shouted 
    curses on the enemy, biting their ankles, till I was carried away 
    yelling, that I might allow people to complete the burial 
    ceremony.
That was how my grandfather Falekun died just as I was becoming 
    aware of him in my life. The title Loogun before his name suggested 
    he was a warrior by profession but I suspect that he did not rise 
    above the middle ranks as did Ogedengbe, Arimoro and Obe. Indeed my 
    elder cousin Abe Fakuwajo told me this unedifying story about him 
    which must have been told by Grandfather himself or by Abe's 
    father who was Grandfather's elder brother. On one occasion 
    when the enemy had sacked the town of Ilesha and men, women and 
    children were being led away to captivity by the conquering army, 
    my grandfather was being dragged away by a man when they met a 
    horseman of the conquering army who forcibly wrested my grandfather 
    from his first captor and forcibly seated him on his horse and rode 
    away. The man deprived of a slave dared not complain to anybody as 
    it was battle justice and the horseman was the stronger of the 
    two.
My grandfather riding at the back of his new master noticed that 
    he had placed his sword in its sheath behind him. He carefully 
    pulled out the sword and with one stroke dealt his new master a 
    mortal blow. Then he alighted from the horse, beckoned to the other 
    man who was still smarting from the unfair dispossession of a 
    slave, and surrendered to him both himself and the horse. The 
    amazed master took him eventually to Sagainu his home-town. There 
    he made him his head slave in recognition of his loyalty to him and 
    his integrity in the battlefield at Ilesha.
Grandfather Loogun Falekun came back to Ilesha via Abeokuta 
    about 1890, after the famous Kiriji War and the treaties of peace 
    and friendship between the British Government and the Kings of the 
    subtribes of Yorubaland that had taken part in the devastating war. 
    He had married Yeye Oni at Sagamu. On his way back to Ilesha after 
    the war he had stayed for some time in Abeokuta where my aunt 
    Fayombo and my father were probably born.
Grandfather certainly had other wives before and after marrying 
    Grandmother Oni but these other wives had only daughters and only 
    Oni had two sons Aluko and Ayeni. Another wife, Adenike, senior to 
    Oni, also had an only son Jegede, who was older than my father.
I do not know how large my grandfather's extended family 
    was at Ilesha before they were scattered by war and he ended up in 
    slavery at Sagamu. At the ingathering after the Kiriji War not many 
    people turned up at Ilesha. They had either died in slavery or only 
    a few members of the household went into slavery.
There were Falekun, his elder brother a diviner by profession, 
    and a sister. Among the relatives that I was told of are Turton, 
    popularly known as Akowe Ogburuu, and Teju Oyeleye's mother at 
    Ogbon Agbede near Ikoti.
The one woman who gave me much food and much attention during my 
    grandfather's funeral festivities I came to know as my mother 
    Dejubee. I must have seen her before then but it was only at the 
    funeral that I was aware of her existence. She and my father Aluko 
    had come back from Ojoku, a village near Offa in Ilorin Province, 
    to take part in my grandfather's funeral. And after the 
    funeral they decided to take me back with them to Ojoku where they 
    were Osomalo traders.
The first leg of some twenty odd miles journey was from Ilesha 
    to Oshogbo and I did it partly strapped to the back of my mother, 
    and I partly rode on the shoulders of my father and my uncle Ayeni. 
    Between Oshogbo and Apata Aje Station I rode on a train for the 
    first time. I was amazed and confused when I was hustled out of the 
    train at the last station, my father telling me that we were at 
    journey's end. I was not aware that the train had left Oshogbo 
    at all. Apparently the peculiar noise of the locomotive engine 
    signified motion in the train! I again rode on the back of my 
    mother and the shoulders of my father and my uncle for the few 
    miles from the railway station to the village of Ojoku.
I reckon I was four years old when my paternal grandfather died 
    at Ilesha, and I followed my parents to their trading village in 
    Ojoku. When later I came to know that I was born in 1918, I 
    concluded that my grandfather died in 1922 and that I also came to 
    Ojoku in 1922. And I also guessed my cousin Afolabi was born at 
    Ilesha in the same year 1922.
At Ojoku my father and mother were engaged in the Osomalo 
    business. Periodically Father would travel to Lagos by train taking 
    with him a wagon load of yams which he would sell there. With the 
    money realised from the sale he would buy several bales of 
    different kinds of cloth which he would bring back by train to 
    Apata Aje the nearest station to Ojoku. These he and mother sold in 
    Ojoku and the surrounding villages. Since the village man or woman 
    could not afford to purchase on the basis of immediate cash 
    payment, he or she readily agreed to buy on credit involving 
    repayment by monthly 
    installments. But the Osomalo was usually before the 
    stipulated time, back asking to be paid his money and vowing never 
    to sit nor to stand but to squat down on his legs till he was paid 
    his debt. The debtor dared not complain to the police of Osomalo 
    harassment because for a little bribe the police was sure to side 
    with the Osomalo and cause further and harsher harassment to the 
    debtor.
Mother prepared a quick breakfast for the family and quickly 
    disappeared on her round of the adjoining villages with her bale of 
    cloths. My father at the same time went to his own group of 
    villages. So the two of them went on their business, leaving me, 
    their four year old son, to take care of myself as best as I could 
    till they returned for mother to prepare a meal in the evening. I 
    am probably doing my parents a disservice now in reporting that 
    they did not take enough care of me. My four year old mind probably 
    forgot what good arrangement they provided for me but stored up 
    only the hunger before they arrived back in the evening. Also I 
    might have been five and not four and was thought to be more able 
    to look after myself than a four year old. In any case in the 
    company of village kids I soon learnt bad habits, like pilfering 
    coins from under my mother's mat and buying groundnuts with 
    the loot.
A few years before she died my mother visited me and my wife 
    Bisi in Lagos and told us this story of my days in Ojoku. I had 
    gone to buy groundnuts with a coin of denomination very much higher 
    than a child could legitimately come by. The groundnut woman 
    suspected that I must have stolen it, probably from my mother, 
    accepted the coin and gave me a parcel of groundnuts. She then 
    followed me to my mother. She explained to her what had happened 
    and returned the coin to my grateful mother.
As I grew older I also grew wilder. Father brought for me from 
    Lagos a copy of the Yoruba primer called ABD, the first three 
    letters of the Yoruba alphabet. He himself tried to teach me. He 
    aIso made me promise to learn it instead of following the village 
    urchins when he and mother had gone to sell textiles in the 
    villages, but after the newness had worn off I threw the new book 
    aside to follow my fellow urchins. No amount of thrashing from my 
    father and sobbing from my mother would make me change my ways.
My parents were horrified to learn after returning from their 
    rounds one evening of my involvement with the Eshu Shrine. There 
    was an Eshu Shrine in nearly every household in Ojoku, and at each 
    Shrine was palm oil, cowries and onini coins. Our gang would go to 
    a house when the occupants were not in and steal the oninis and the 
    cowries, wipe the food remnants and oil from them, and would go 
    round the corner to buy groundnuts with the apparently lean money. 
    The groundnut seller did not suspect the source of our money. If 
    she did she would have fainted!
My father gave me a thorough beating which made my mother cry 
    ever so much. I really did not see what distressed them so much 
    about me. In their wisdom they decided that I must leave Ojoku 
    before I grew to become a perfect vagabond. I could not go back to 
    Ilesha because they thought my grandmother Oni Eleran would be 
    unable to cope with me. My mother came out with the answer. In her 
    father's village, Oko-Igbo, there was a Village teacher cum 
    Catechist who lived in her father's compound. They would send 
    me to him at Oko-Igbo and he would knock some sense into my little 
    head.
The next phase of my childhood started therefore with the 
    village Teacher at Oko Igbo, a village near Ilesha. Subsequent 
    events made me think that the year was 1924, not 1923. You see I 
    was very young then and I knew no nothing about dates.
The Village Teacher, who I came to know as Funlayo, lived with 
    his nephew Folayan in two of the many rooms in the compound of my 
    maternal grandfather, Ademoroti Sonibare. Here my 
    grandfather's children, some married and some unmarried, and 
    other relatives, lived in a large household into which Funlayo the 
    outsider fitted fairly well. He was a teacher about sixteen to 
    eighteen years old. His nephew Folayan was some three years older 
    than I. The arrival of my goodself was easily managed by my 
    doubling with Folayan in one of the two rooms at night.

NigerianEnglish,could,Such many other rules could be found in English or any other natural language through careful study,epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,ess_11,"1.2 Focus of the Study
Phonology studies the sound system of languages and aims at 
    demonstrating the patterns of distinctive sounds found in a 
    language. It makes possible general statements about the nature of 
    sound systems found in languages of the world; is also concerned 
    with the range and functions of sounds in specific languages, and 
    with the rules, which can be written to show the types of phonetic 
    relationships that relate and contrast linguistic units (Crystal, 
    1991:.261). The Phonological Rules of a language mainly deal 
    with its phonological processes and the distinctive features of its 
    segments. Considering what phonological processes and distinctive 
    features are, a study of a language’s Phonological Rules would then 
    capture and take care of a reasonable aspect of the language’s 
    phonology.
A Phonological Rule, in the words of Trask (1996:.273), is 
    “any rule which, in some analysis, is posited as involved in 
    deriving a pronunciation”. That is, it deals with rules 
    appealing to morphological and lexical information as well as 
    phonetic (allophonic) rules. Phonological Rules also convert 
    phonological representations into phonetic forms by really 
    explaining and bringing out the exact condition under which a 
    phonological process takes place. This can be stated in terms of 
    classes of sounds to which the rules apply, and the classes of 
    sounds can be described in terms of features of which they are 
    composed. A Phonological Rule in English, for instance, may state a 
    consonant is palatalized when it occurs before a front vowel and 
    can be written thus:
Such many other rules could be found in English or any other 
    natural language through careful study. In the process of studying 
    a language’s Phonological Rules, it would be easy to recognize the 
    language’s segments’ distinctive features, and this would really 
    pay off since there is scanty literature on an in-depth explanation 
    or revelation of a language’s Phonological Rules. This is the 
    essence of this research, which will automate for documentation, 
    the establishment of Phonological Rules in Anaang, a Lower Cross 
    Language spoken in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria.
1.3 Background Information on the Anaang People
The name, Anaang implies both languages and ethnic group 
    (people). This section and the next therefore gives some 
    information about the people of Anaang as well as the Anaang 
    language.
1.3.1 Origin and Migration
History has it that the Anaang people, together with other 
    Bantus originated from the central Benue valley in Nigerian and 
    probably moved through the Northern sector of the Cross River to 
    the Enyong Creek. They eventually traveled through the present day 
    Eastern Ibibio land (Ikono) to settle at the location of present 
    day Abak (Greenberg, 1963, cited in Nyarks, 2002:.21). Essien 
    (1983:.5-6, cited in Nyarks 2002) - who argues that life had 
    already existed along the banks and valleys of the rivers and in 
    Cross River thousands of years before the Bantus migrated to that 
    side - points out the origin of the Anaangs to be Ibom, near Aro 
    North-West and East of the Cross River along the highland of 
    Cameroon. He notes that the Anaangs were there many thousands of 
    years before the Cameroonians settled there.
In a bid to find a new location for their unification and 
    maintain their identity as a people, the Anaangs migrated from the 
    Cross River coast to Abak, through Eket, Oron and Western Nsit 
    where some of them also settled. That is why Udoh (1983:.9) 
    notes that the roots of Afaha Eket in Eket Local Government Area, 
    Afaha Ikot Ebak in Essien Udim Local Government Area, Afaha Obong 
    in Abak Local Government Area, Afaha Nsung in Okobo Local 
    Government Area, Afaha Nsit in Nsit Ibom Local Government 
    Area and many other Afahas (italics mine) could be traced 
    to one stock. They accept all Afaha people as blood Kinsmen i.e imaan. Esema (2002:.7), who 
    corroborates this account, also notes that the Anaang people 
    religiously accept and follow the adage, “Afaha Ikidde 
    Afaha ikpa ekong”, meaning literally that an Afaha man 
    can do no harm to a fellow Afaha man.
Notwithstanding the oral traditions1 
    During an interview with Dr. C.T. 
    Udoh, a seasoned Historian, he maintained that the Anaangs have 
    always been where they are now. They dispersed to their present 
    location from Abak. and written records regarding Anaang 
    origin and migration, there seems to be a consensus that the 
    present Anaang counties and councils are a result of migration from 
    Abak. Forde and Jones (1967:.83, cited in Nyoyoko, 1997:.9) give a reticent and vivid account of this:
The Anaang society appears to have originated from a 
    single society or group of villages all situated close to the 
    present Abak Local Government Area headquarters. Thus, each of 
    these villages is regarded as the parent village from which new 
    settlements lived off in various directions…ancestors came from 
    Ikot Imo in Abak Local Government Area. However, most traditions 
    identify the place of secondary dispersal with Afaha 
    Obong.
1.3.2 Location and Population
In Nigeria, the Anaang people are in Akwa Ibom State, 
    South-South of the country. They are the second largest ethnic 
    group in Akwa Ibom State, occupying the Northwestern part of the 
    state with a total land area of 2.73square kilometers and an 
    average density range between 600 and 800 people per square mile. 
    (Nyoyoko, 1997:.9, Micheal and Obot, 2001:.14). From 
    the 1991 census result, the people number about 1 million (Connel 
    1991:.8; Urua, 1996:.51; Grimes, 2000:.167). 
    Udondata (2006:.2) puts the Anaang population at 4 million, 
    though he does not state his source and date, but the 2006 census 
    result puts Anaang total population at 2.4 
    million2This information is 
    from the National Population Commision..
They are bounded in the North by the Isogbo Igbo (Abia State), 
    in the West by the Ngwas (Abia State) and Ndoki (Rivers State) and 
    in the South, East and Northeast by the Ibibios. They occupy eight 
    of the thirty-one L.G.As of Akwa Ibom State, namely; 
    Abak, Essien Udim, Etim Ekpo, Ikot Ekpene, Obot Akara, Ika, Oruk 
    Anam and Ukanafun.
1.3.3 Nomenclature:
The name, Anaang, was first mentioned in 1854 by Sigismund 
    Wilhelm Kolle (a German missionary in Sierra Leone) in his book 
    Polyglotta Africana, where he reported that 
    Anaang was one of the languages spoken by liberated slaves in 
    Sierra Leone (Udoh, 1983:.83). There is the need to mention 
    that usage of the name bore a different spelling - 
    “Annang”. After Sigismund Koelle in 1854, this 
    spelling has been used even until this 
    21st century. Other linguists (and 
    non-linguists) however prefer to write it as Anaang. Going by the 
    Lower Cross phonology, a syllabified pronunciation of 
    “Annang” would be /unclear 
    / while that of Anaang would be 
    unclear. Even a child at the 
    infantile lisping stage would agree that s/he normally hears adult 
    natives pronouncing the latter, not the former. 
    “Anaang” (rather than “Annang 
    ) is therefore a better 
    graphical expression of the native speakers’ pronunciation of the 
    name. I therefore prefer the usage of Anaang in this work over and 
    above every other.
The name, Anaang, according to Udoh (1983:.2) and Umana 
    (2002:.1-2) is derived from the characteristic behaviours of 
    a tribe who are clothed with fury, indignation, intolerance and 
    vindictiveness. Perhaps, in line with this, Udoh (1983:.99) – 
    who believes that Anaang is a part of Ibibio - says Anaang is from 
    the Ibibio words 
    Anaanga (to be 
    intoxicated with alcohol), Anaang 
    Ide (to be intoxicated with bravery), 
    Unnang (black dyed 
    raffia worn by Ekpo 
    Onyoho masquerader). He infers therefore 
    that Anaang means ‘wild’ or 
    ‘warrior’ since the Anaangs fought many wars 
    against the Ngwa Igbos to preserve and protect their farmlands and 
    territories against invasion.
1.3.4 Ethnic Affinity
Just like Udoh (1983:.99) already mentioned above, there 
    is the belief that Anaang is a part of Ibibio. In line with this, 
    Udoh (1983:.2) however notes that Anaang and Ibibio only have 
    common dialects and intermarriage traditions with none a part of 
    the other. Based on this commonness, the ancestors of the Anaangs 
    and the Ibibios were classified by the colonial masters and 
    missionaries as one race or group of family. One of the 
    colonialists had once written that “the Anaang are Ibibio 
    people speaking a dialect of Ibibio, populating the areas covered 
    by the Abak Division and Western half of the Ikot Ekpene 
    Division” (Udoh, 1983:.84).
This may have been because of the fact that the colonialists had 
    not yet entered the Anaang land, and when they did, they heard them 
    speak similar dialects of Ibibio with similar patterns and then 
    grouped them as one family or race. One of the Colonial District 
    Officers in Abak District, Mr. S. E. Johnson 
    had stated in 1932 that the Anaang sub tribe seemed to have been 
    the last to have come in contact with the Europeans because they 
    were the last area in the Calabar Province to be opened up by the 
    Government (Udoh, 1983:.84). Following the colonialists’ 
    claims, some Ibibios are still of the strong view that Anaang is a 
    sub-tribe of Ibibio. To give credence to his view, Udoh (1983:.86) quotes an Anaang anthropologist to have said that “it is 
    generally believed that the entire group now forming the 
    Southeastern state belongs to the Bantoid group 
    … the Anaang have the same history 
    of migration as the Efik-Ibibio.” The point here is that the 
    Anaangs, Efiks and Ibibios may have migrated differently from 
    wherever they were originally, to settle at the Cross River 
    coast.3 Based on this also, 
    Udoh (2003:.34) notes some historians like Noah (1994:.27) to have concluded that the different ethnic groups in Akwa 
    Ibom state may have migrated from one place, even though they 
    settled in their present abodes at different times. As a 
    result, they intermarried, shared certain things and features and 
    became one. However, a time came (as noted by Essien 1983:.14, cited in Nyarks, 2006:. 2) when the Anaang ancestors 
    wanted to secure a special entity for themselves in order to 
    separate themselves from the Ibibios and exist as a distinct tribe 
    with their own language, tradition and culture. This led to their 
    migration story as related in section
1.3.1. Quote Wardhaugh****
Still to prove the Anaang ethnic affiliation with Ibibio, Udoh 
    (1983:.89) mentions that the Ibibio State Union held her 
    inaugural meeting in Ikot Ekpene (an Anaang land) in 1928, and the 
    Anaangs joined the Union freely. But Udoh (1983:.16) mentions 
    that the Anaang people who resisted the inclusion of their tribe in 
    Ibibio wanted the name to be written Ibibio and Anaang Union. 
    Therefore, the name was not agreed by the majority of Anaang 
    people. He maintains that the Union, not created to transform the 
    Anaang people into Ibibio was a joint programme set up by the two 
    ethnic groups for unification and development.
In line with Udoh’s account, Umana (2002:.3) reveals 
    that:
The first politico-cultural organization recorded in the annals 
    of people movement in Nigeria was the Anaang Union formed by one 
    Udosen Obot of Ikot Ekpene in 1927 
    … the progenitor of the then Ibibio State College 
    … The land on which the college stands 
    was donated by Udosen Obot to the Anaang Union and later to the 
    Ibibio State Union which emerged as the amalgam of Anaang Union and 
    Ibibio state movement in 1928. The Anaang Union was so popular that 
    it soon embraced the whole of the mainland divisions of the then 
    Calabar Province, metamorphosing…into the Ibibio Union in 1928. The 
    metamorphosing brought about serious ethnic squabbles between the 
    Ibibios and the Anaangs causing the name to be changed in 1953 
    (August) to Ibibio and Anaang Union.
In as much as this is not a political document to speak for or 
    against any ethnic group as a parent body or affiliate, it is apt 
    to note from the arguments in this section that if given the 
    latitude, there would continue to be claims and counter-claims 
    beyond doubt about the parenthood and offspringship of various 
    ethnic groups in the state as just seen above. Therefore, it would 
    be more sensible to toe Udoh’s (2003:.34) line of 
    appreciating the need of a people to carve out an identity, whether 
    separate or related to other groups. It would really pay off to 
    respect such sentiments at any time they are expressed in as much 
    as we all look forward to language development because one mark of 
    identity of a people or ethnic group is the language they speak, 
    for example Oro, Ibibio, Anang, Ekid, etc. With the 
    culturally-related outlook of the various groups in Akwa Ibom 
    state, coupled with mutual intelligibility of some languages, it 
    would be better to talk about ethnic affinity than ethnic 
    affiliation.

NigerianEnglish,could,"For example, one could suppose that God has established the connection between measles and its characteristic red spots, or between fire and smoke, perhaps just so that we might know when someone has measles or that there is a fire",epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,ess_01,"Meaning in Natural Language
This general view of the status of language has enjoyed a 
    lengthy ascendancy. Critics, such as Wittgenstein, have not 
    prevailed. The recent focus by Dretske, Fodor, Pinker, and others, 
    on a semantics for mentalese exists 
    along side followers of Grice, who focus on the role 
    speaker intent plays in determining the meaning in natural 
    language. All hold that the principal bearers and determinants of 
    semantic properties are something other than natural language.
There is an alternative to the view that natural language has 
    meaning only that is derivative, as an encoding of thought and the 
    primary bearer of meaning. Since the cardinal aim of language is to 
    convey information about how things are viewed in the world, in 
    consonance with Locke's dire warning that taking words as 
    standing ""for the reality of things"" is 
    a perverting the use of words, and brings 
    unavoidable obscurity and confusion into their 
    signification, whenever we make them stand for 
    anything but those ideas we have in our own 
    minds.
In the analysis of how the meaning of natural language can be 
    understood as a special case of natural meaning. Language, of 
    course, is at least complicated by the presence of intelligent 
    language users. It is arguable that linguistic meaning is as much 
    like natural meaning as it could be, given the presence of an 
    intelligent agent in the causal web linking world and linguistic 
    representation.
The physical systems designed to convey information, 
    non-intelligent instruments that are such that their display states 
    mean one thing or another. Having developed a case for a meaning 
    for linguistic displays that is related to natural meaning, three 
    ways are set out in which meaning for natural language might be 
    understood as derivative of natural meaning. Then, let us 
    reconsider the arguments at the beginning of Paul Grice's 
    classic paper, 
    Meaning, to see if there is as great a difference between 
    natural meaning and linguistic meaning as Grice makes out.
Over the years since Grice' s ""Meaning"" appeared, 
    attention to his work has largely focused on his theory of 
    non-natural meaning. Independently, others have been developing 
    accounts of various types of natural meaning. Much of this work has 
    been done by Fred Dretske and Jerry Fodor, who have been interested 
    in understanding the meaning of mental representations in terms of 
    information they carry. While many have rejected Grice's 
    highly intellectualized theory of meaning, as far as I know they 
    have not discussed Grice's original distinction of the two 
    types of meaning. That distinction remains very interesting, and it 
    is useful, in light of subsequent 
    developments, to revisit his 
    paper.
Grice begins by making a distinction between two types of 
    meaning, then in the rest of the paper he attempts almost exclusively to the second of these, which 
    he calls ""non-natural meaning"". At the 
    very beginning of the paper, Grice invites readers to consider 
    three sentences having to do with meaning:
""Those spots mean measles.""
""Those spots did not mean anything to me, but to the 
    doctor they meant measles.""
""The recent budget means that we shall have a hard 
    year.""
These are all cases of natural meaning, or, following Grice, 
    meaning(n). Note that not all bearers of natural meaning are 
    natural events or facts - the last example is a budget. Generally, 
    natural meaning concerns symptoms or signs or some state of 
    affairs. Other examples might be ""smoke means fire"", 
    ""that drop in barometric pressure means rain"", and 
    ""the fact that the car is exhausting blue smoke means that it 
    is burning oil."".
In the cases of natural meaning, the connection between the 
    bearer of natural meaning and the state that it indicates does not 
    owe to agency. But even in cases like these one could suppose that 
    although no agent is a component of the causal connection, 
    nevertheless the existence of the causal connection itself is the 
    result of an intelligent agent. For example, one could suppose that 
    God has established the connection between measles and its 
    characteristic red spots, or between fire and smoke, perhaps just 
    so that we might know when someone has measles or that there is a 
    fire. If God were to act in these ways, he would be what Dretske 
    has called a ""structuring cause"" - He 
    would cause it to be the case that measles cause red spots, or that 
    fire causes smoke. The meaning of smoke and spots would still be 
    natural meaning, for God would not on each occasion of the 
    appearance of spots or smoke cause them to appear. Rather He would 
    have arranged things so that in the ordinary course of things, 
    measles cause red spots and fire causes smoke, so that from red 
    spots one may infer measles, and from smoke one may infer fire.
Cases where natural meaning is at work as the result of 
    structuring agents are particularly interesting for exploring the 
    connection between semantics and pragmatics, and the relation of 
    natural and non-natural meaning. Accordingly, considering the 
    special case of instruments, devices, which are designed to convey 
    information about some condition. These have, as it were, 
    artificial natural meaning.
The lights and gauges on the instrument panel of a car indicate 
    various facts about the condition of the vehicle. That the leftmost 
    light is on may indicate that the oil pressure is low. Or, as we 
    might also put it, that the light is on means that the oil pressure 
    is low. Although the light is an artifact, it functions as an 
    indicator or symptom of states of affairs. Statements about what 
    the display states of an instrument mean have the same logic as the 
    natural meaning of red spots on the skin and clouds in the sky. 
    Namely, they support inference to certain states of affairs, and it 
    they do not support inference to anyone meaning anything by turning 
    on the light. It is less clear (to use another one of Grice's 
    tests for non-natural meaning) whether they support inference to 
    something of the form:
The fact that the leftmost light is on mean ""the oil 
    pressure is low"".
In part this uncertainty, at least on my part, is because I am 
    not sure that this claim, that a fact means a sentence, is 
    coherent. But perhaps we could say :
The fact that the leftmost light is on means the same as would a 
    talking car that said, ""the oil pressure is low"".
This would relate the meaning of one state of affairs, the fact 
    that the light is on, to the meaning of another state of affairs, 
    one that involves producing an instance of a sentence. This at 
    least seems coherent, unlike Grice's own example involving a 
    quoted sentence. In any case, it seems reasonable to suspect that 
    Grice' s example has paraphrases that are coherent in 
    idiolects other than his own.
The oil pressure light can malfunction. Then its being on might 
    not mean that the oil pressure is low. Of course, it is supposed to 
    mean that the oil pressure is low. And it usually means that. But, 
    if it is malfunctioning, that is not what its being on now means. 
    This may appear to be a difference with some forms of natural 
    meaning, where there is an invariable connection between the thing 
    or state said to have the meaning and the meaning. But it is not 
    unusual even with paradigms of natural meaning for the connection 
    not to be invariable. Clouds that usually mean storms sometimes 
    appear without the storms, (and the storms may arrive unheralded by 
    any clouds). Most disease symptoms can appear in a variety of 
    conditions. S o there can be lack of 
    an invariable connection between bearer of natural meaning and its 
    meaning. We might then say ""x usually means p"". Common 
    simple single-purpose dashboard indicators are always each directly 
    connected with the sensors for the conditions they indicate. Such 
    single purpose indicators 
    may be supplanted by more sophisticated indicator systems. And in 
    order to understand meaning, it may be useful to consider what 
    would happen to meaning in more sophisticated indicator systems.
Now let us turn to reconsider the rest of Grice's 
    distinction between natural and non-natural meaning. Grice gives 
    two examples of what he subsequently calls non-natural meaning, and 
    then he draws five conclusions about the difference between natural 
    and non-natural meaning. His examples:
""Those three rings on the bell (of the bus) mean 
    that the bus is full.""
""That remark, 'Smith couldn't get on 
    without bis trouble and strife,' meant that Smith found his 
    wife indispensable. ""
With regards to these, Grice says that it is characteristic of 
    such cases of non-natural meaning that one can say ""x means 
    that p, but in fact not p"". Thus his first conclusion is:
1. Using the first of these, I can as well say, ""But 
    it isn't in fact full - the conductor has made a 
    mistake""; and I can use the second and go on, ""But in 
    fact Smith deserted her seven years ago.""
However it seems to me that this may not be true of the bell 
    ringing example! If the bus is not full, then those three rings on 
    the bell did not mean that the bus is full. Perhaps they are 
    supposed to mean that the bus is full, and perhaps they usually 
    mean that the bus is full, and perhaps they were intended to mean 
    that the bus is full, but they did not in fact mean the bus is 
    full. Similar considerations apply to the second example. The 
    remark - Smith' s remarking - did not mean that Smith finds 
    his wife indispensable, although it is plausible to suppose that it 
    was intended to be taken by Smith's auditors to mean that.
Also, as mentioned above, there appear to be cases of natural 
    meaning where there is not an invariable connection between a type 
    of sign and a type of indicated state of affairs. Thus, I can say 
    ""spots like those usually mean measles, but not in this 
    case."" And one could say much the same of the three rings of 
    the bell on a bus not yet full.
Grice's second point about natural and non-natural 
    meaning:
I can argue from the first to some statement about 
    ""what is (was) meant"" by the rings on the bell and from 
    the second to some statement about ""what is (was) meant"" 
    by the quoted remark.
This point seems correct. However, these sentences seem 
    elliptical for an explicit attribution of agency to the bell ringer 
    and the remarker. It is not that something is meant by the quoted 
    sentence, rather it is meant by the speaker in using the quoted 
    sentence. Compare a statement about what was accomplished by blows 
    to the midriff - this presumably is a covert attribution of agency, 
    elliptical for what x accomplished by x's blows to the 
    midriff. Similarly, in speaking about what was meant by 
    rin gs on a bell, I am speaking 
    about what x meant by x' s rings on a bell, or perhaps in the 
    case of meaning, what x intended to mean by x's rings on a 
    bell. The construction attributing meaning of this sort to bell 
    rings and remarks instead of an agent may be a natural 
    accommodation in cases where we don't know who the agent 
    is.
Taking into account from the first sentence to the conclusion 
    that somebody (viz., the conductor) meant, or at any rate 
    should have meant, by the rings that the bus is full, and I can 
    argue analogously for the second sentence.
Here Grice appears to be aware for the first time that we might 
    say something about what the conductor should have meant, by the 
    rings on the bell. But he does not seem aware that doing this 
    creates difficulties for his theory. For he later goes on to hold 
    that ""A meant(nn)something by x"" is 
    (roughly) equivalent to
But the last clause doesn't make sense - the conductor 
    presumably did intend the rings of the bell to produce an effect in 
    an audience, so what is the point of saying that he should have 
    done this? After all, if he should have intended, but did not 
    intend, to produce an effect in the audience, then presumably his 
    rings on the bell don't mean(NN) anything at all.

NigerianEnglish,could,Such lady could have saved herself and her husband from such trouble if only she had done the right thing at the right time,epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,PNsc_05,"Staphylococcus (VII)
My belief is that most of our men today are also in the same 
    situation as Mr. Peter and for one reason or the other 
    failed to seek help when necessary. If you are also having a 
    similar challenge, I call it a challenge because I believe it is 
    not a problem for God to use us to solve it. So, why don’t you give 
    it a trial and come to any of our offices nearest to you.
Staphylococcal infection does not cause infertility in men 
    alone, the women folks are not left out of this health menace, and 
    in fact I will like to say that women are the most affected gender 
    when it comes to staph infection. This is due to how wonderfully 
    they were created, mostly when they make use of public toilets it 
    is very easy for them to contract the infection, as their 
    gentile areas are exposed to the 
    infection.
Most women would have contracted this infection even before 
    marriage usually as a toilet infection, but due to ignorance or 
    nonchalant attitude the infection would have affected the 
    reproductive organs. If you are a lady and in one time or another 
    you have treated one infection or another especially a venereal 
    disease, you have to make sure that you are totally cured. One 
    mistake that most ladies make is that once they experience itching 
    in their private part they go to chemists to buy drugs to stop the 
    itching. Once the itching stops they feel they are okay and free, 
    not knowing that they have only cured the infection externally but 
    internally the infection is still there. The internal infection may 
    not show any serious symptoms for some years, but it will gradually 
    be affecting the internal reproductive organs. When such women now 
    get married they find it difficult to conceive, running from one 
    gynecologist to another. Such lady could have saved herself and her 
    husband from such trouble if only she had done the right thing at 
    the right time.
Staphylococcal infection usually takes different forms, most 
    often, an infected person may not be aware of having the infection, 
    because he or she may not have any serious symptoms initially. 
    Sometimes a victim may be having some common ailments, which he or 
    she may just overlook as just an ordinary or common sickness. A 
    very good example of this is someone having a recurrent malaria or 
    typhoid fever, which always return after few weeks of treatment. 
    The funny thing about this situation is that when such people go to 
    the hospital or laboratory for test, all that will be revealed is 
    that they are malaria parasite positive. Such people will continue 
    wasting their hard-earned money on treating malaria without any 
    appreciable result. In some cases a victim of staph may not have 
    any defined symptom, but such a person will feel unwell, restless, 
    and constant headache. When such person goes to hospital for 
    medical check up, nothing will be revealed and
such a person is said to be medically fit. But within themselves 
    they know that they are not okay. A good example is a patient after 
    reading our article on staphylococcus infection and the symptoms, 
    came to our office to complain that he has been to different 
    hospitals for various tests which all revealed nothing. After 
    carrying out some series of tests on him in our office, he was 
    diagnosed to be having a heavy growth of staph. aureus and

NigerianEnglish,can,This means that no French or Russian man can worship with understanding in a Portuguese Church except he understands Portuguese language,dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,PHum_19,"When language matters
To grasp the meaning of the world of today we use a 
    language created to express the world of yesterday. The life of the 
    past seems to us nearer our true natures only for the reason that 
    it is nearer our language"". By Exupery, from his book: 
    ‘Wind, Sand and Star’, (1939).
This is the month in which Arabic language was born practically 
    over 1,440 years ago. With the revelation of the Qur’an, seed of that language became firmly planted grammatically, 
    phonologically and morphologically. Until the coming of the divine 
    revelation called the Qur’an, Arabic remained for 
    thousands of years without syntax. Thus, Ramadan 
    can be described as the historic month of revolution without which 
    humanity would have continued to rigmarole in the wilderness of 
    ignorance.
Language, generally, is not just a means of communicating and 
    understanding ideas and experiences. It is also an instrument of 
    documenting and relating the events and occurrences of the past to 
    the future via the present. Language is the prima 
    facie of any culture. A tribe or community without a 
    language lives without a culture.
Every language is primarily spoken either by words of mouth or 
    by gesticulation but became converted into writing for the purpose 
    of recording sounds and preservation of history. It is the 
    foundation of all civilisations in all human eras. It is man’s 
    greatest invention without which all other inventions including 
    scientific and technological inventions would have been 
    impossible.
Whether in spoken or written form, language comes to serve as 
    the main intermediary among the races and tribes of mankind, 
    yesterday, today and tomorrow. The birth and death of humans; the 
    rise and fall of empires; the migrations and settlements of nations 
    and tribes are all announced or chronicled in languages. Even some 
    inanimate objects speak onomatopoeically sometimes to the 
    admiration of man.
It is with language alone that every human thought germinates 
    and is turned into reality from dream. Not only that, language is 
    also the cultural law that governs the 
    wild life be it agro or aqua. The nature of language, its 
    importance, its complexity and its role in human life are such 
    that, this world would have been meaningless without it.
Allah tells us in Qur’an 49:13 thus: 
    ""Oh people! We have created you from a male and a 
    female and made you into nations and tribes that you might interact 
    with one another. Surely the noblest among you is the most 
    righteous of you. Allah is wise and all-knowing"".
The idea of this topic arose from a question posed to me 
    recently by a Lagos Muslim socialite. He said: ""rather than 
    observing Salat in Arabic language which we do 
    not understand why don’t we do it either in English or vernacular 
    which we understand very well?"" He cited the example of the 
    Churches where Christians worship in various but understandable 
    languages and concluded that such an innovation might bring more 
    converts to Islam and more people to the Mosque. He did not stop 
    there. He went further to advocate for reduction in the number of 
    times we (Muslims) observe Salat daily saying 
    that that might be ‘more realistic’ and 
    ‘more convenient’ especially for busy 
    and travelling people. You can see, from that question, the extent 
    of naivety which ignorance is capable of conferring on its victims. 
    Or how else will you judge a mortal being who wants to amend the 
    constitution of his Immortal Creator? And our brother is not the 
    only one with such a parochial idea. There are some others like 
    him.
In my response, I asked the enquirer to tell me why Islam 
    remains the fastest growing religion in the West today despite 
    their worshipping in understandable languages in the Churches in 
    that part of the world. I made a particular reference to Britain 
    where Churches are sold to Muslims in scores to be converted into 
    Mosques and asked him to tell me any religion he knew that was ever 
    revealed in English language.
I did not stop there. I also went further to ask him whether it 
    was reasonable to let his employees work for only three days in a 
    week instead of six days while he pays them fully for the whole 
    week. I then took advantage of the glaring evidence of confusion on 
    his visage to put burner in my fervour as a student of English 
    language and tutored him a little on the fact that English which he 
    parochially perceived as an ideal language was not original. I told 
    him how England was colonised severally for centuries by various 
    countries and empires including France, Germany, Italy and 
    Scandinavia. I let him know that English only emerge as an adopted 
    language from a combination of the languages of England’s colonial 
    masters in the 10th century (A.C). I pointed out to him that 
    not only about 9,700 words of the modern English language were 
    borrowed from French and Anglicised but also that most of the 
    clustered consonant words in English are either German or 
    Scandinavian in origin. I cited examples of such words as 
    ‘acknowledgement’, 
    psychology, knight, 
    pseudo, gnash, 
    rhythm, solemn etc. There is 
    also a great influence of some other Indo-European languages, 
    especially from the Upper and the Lower Germanic on English 
    language. Besides, I pointed it out that the country called Britain 
    today, which is a combination of England, Scotland and Wales, is 
    not a monolingual country as sometimes misconceived by most people. 
    Other languages like Celtic and Welsh are still very much spoken in 
    that country today, though restrictedly.
I then settled him down to religion proper and called his 
    attention to the original common language of revelation of the 
    ‘Tawrah’ (Talmud) of Prophet Musa (Moses), the Zabur 
    (Psalms) of Prophet Daud (David) and ‘
    injil’ (Bible) of 
    Prophet Isa (Jesus) which is Hebrew. The Jews still worship in that 
    language today.
In countries like China, Japan, Korea and India, where religions 
    such as Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shinto and Hinduism are in 
    vogue, the languages of worship by the adherents are Chinese, 
    Japanese, Korean and Hindu. And, in terms of numerical strength, no 
    religion in the world today enjoys so large follower-ship as 
    Buddhism which is closely followed by Hinduism because of the huge 
    populations of China and India. Yet the worship in those religions 
    does not go beyond their countries of nativity.
In the West where Christianity holds sway, no single language 
    was adopted for worship after the death of Latin which was the 
    official language of the Roman Empire. While the Germans worship in 
    German, the French, the Spanish, the British, the Americans, the 
    Italians, the Swedish, the Danish, the Russians, the Polish, the 
    Norwegians, the Portuguese and others, all worship in their 
    respective languages.
This means that no French or Russian man can worship with 
    understanding in a Portuguese Church except he understands 
    Portuguese language. This is not the case with Islam. The 
    fulfillment of Allah’s global will for mankind is a universal 
    reality today. That will is contained in Qur’an 
    21:107 thus: ""We have not sent you (Muhammad) forth but 
    as a mercy to the entire world. Say it is revealed to me that your 
    God is one God. Won’t you submit to Him?""
It is only in Islam, of all religions, that adherents from 
    Brazil, Finland, Nigeria, Pakistan and Australia can easily walk 
    into any Mosque in China or Japan or Saudi Arabia and worship 
    jointly behind an Imam without any fear of language discrimination. 
    And that is what makes Islam the universal religion that Allah 
    wills it to be. This is made possible by Arabic language which is 
    the language of the revelation of the Qur’an. In all 
    other religions of the world, adherents, irrespective of their 
    populations, do worship only locally according to their 
    languages.
To call for the abandonment of Arabic language in 
    Salat, therefore, is to call for the reduction 
    of Islam from a universal religion into a local one. Not only that, 
    such a call is a way of advocating for the dismantling of global 
    Muslim unity.
What our pitied socialite brother does not know is the fact that 
    worshipping in Arabic which is the language of the revelation of 
    the Qur’an is the main cause of antagonism against 
    Islam by those who have lost the originality of their religion. 
    That ""Allah is wise and all-knowing"" as 
    quoted above is not in vain. All divine religions were deliberately 
    revealed in the languages of their ‘Messengers’. And no Messenger was sent to the 
    entire world except Prophet Muhammad (SAW).
Arabic, as a language, has become assimilated into Islam as a 
    culture. As a matter of fact, it is with that language that the 
    Muslims imbibed the formidability and courage of resistance which 
    enabled Islam to survive all intrigues, aggressions and 
    intimidations of many empires through the centuries.
As a culture, Islam remains irrepressible for two main reasons. 
    One reason is that it is a spiritual rather than a physical nation 
    with an everlasting ideology. Even if its adherents are conquered, 
    the idea that makes that religion a nation can never be conquered 
    because it is invisible. The other reason is contained in 
    Qur’an 15:9 thus: ""It was ‘We’ who 
    revealed the Qur’an and ‘We’ will certainly preserve 
    it"".
Formidability of a culture depends very much on the tenacity 
    accorded its language by the speakers of that language.
Sometimes a culture may get absorbed into another culture 
    without losing its accompanying language. Sometimes, a language may 
    be assimilated into another language even as the culture is 
    retained. Islam has resistance for both. The early Muslim Arabs did 
    not take only Islam to all conquered nations, they took Arabic, the 
    language of the Qur’an as well. The only exception is 
    Persia (now Iran) which was equally strong linguistically. 
    Countries like Iraq , Syria , Lebanon , Egypt , Morocco , Libya , 
    Algeria and Tunisia were not Arabic speaking until Islam spread to 
    them.
We have similar example here in Nigeria. The Fulanis, who, led 
    by Sheikh Uthman Dan Fodio, re-introduced Islam in its purified 
    form to the conquered areas now called northern Nigeria, had to 
    compromise their language in favour of Islam which was their 
    culture. The Hausas, on the other hand, preferred to sacrifice 
    their pagan culture in favour of their language. Thus, the 
    combination of both has come to give the northern Nigeria a 
    foremost cultural veracity that is almost second to none in Africa. 
    Not only has Hausa language become an international language spoken 
    in the media of most civilised countries, Shari’ah 
    has also been imbibed as the Islamic cultural law of the region.
Today, while most parts of the Southern Nigerian region have 
    enslaved themselves irredeemably to foreign cultures, the north 
    gives a new hope of cultural renaissance to Nigeria and even 
    Africa. From the cultural way the northerners dress and eat, from 
    the way they insist on speaking Hausa language irrespective of 
    where they find themselves, it is becoming clearer that adoption of 
    that language in the UN is just a matter of time. Already, 
    virtually all the countries that matter in the world today have 
    Hausa programmes on their radio and television stations. And far 
    from the self-deception of the southern people who want to eat 
    their cake and still have it, the long expected African 
    civilisation may start from northern Nigeria. The numerical 
    strength of that region is an added advantage.
It is rather unfortunate that the southern Muslims have had to 
    join non-Muslims in replacing their cultural language with the 
    colonial language. The tragedy of this development is that while 
    they are losing their own language, they are unable to grasp the 
    foreign language for which they are craving. In both ways, they are 
    the losers not only today but tomorrow as well.
Prophet Muhammad (SAW) though counseled Muslim Ummah on the need 
    to understand languages other than mother-tongues, nevertheless, he 
    did not support the abdication of one’s own language.

NigerianEnglish,can,Lack of knowledge of all these can seriously hamper meaning analysis,epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,ess_05,"INTRODUCTION
The study of meaning is a tasking exercise. Meaning has been 
    viewed as the most elusive and controversial phenomenon in language 
    study. Its' vague nature gives 
    room for diverse interpretations depending on the speaker, the 
    hearer and the situation. Philosophers, anthropologists and 
    linguists have tried to give solution to the unstable and ambiguous 
    nature of meaning but could not. It is because of the status of 
    meaning, certain problems associate with its analysis in natural 
    languages. Several theories of meaning have been propounded to 
    address these problems. This paper therefore aims at discussing 
    some problems associated with the analysis of meaning and a current 
    theory which has reasonably addresses these problems.
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANALYSIS OF MEANING IS 
    NATURAL LANGUAGES.
There are certain problems associated with the analysis of 
    meaning in natural languages. Some of the problems are discussed 
    below. The problem of graded boundaries hinders proper analysis of 
    meaning in natural languages. Jackendoff (1996) cited in Udofot 
    (2004:.140) observe that:
In talking about the colour ""red"" in 
    English one is faced with a broad range of lavender so that at a 
    point one may have a problem of hues from orange to lavender so 
    that at a point one may have a problem of noticing where orange 
    stops and lavender begins...
According to her, there is also borderline case where a 
    particular colour can be seen as red, orange or lavender depending 
    on the context. Similar problems exist for a word like 
    fat: What for instance is the lower boundary of 
    a fat woman? When or at what size can a woman be described as thin, 
    medium or fat? are relevant to the problem of graded boundaries.
Ambiguity is another problem 
    encountered in the analysis of 
    meaning in natural languages. Ambiguous words or utterance are 
    those open to diverse interpretations depending on the linguistic 
    context. For example the expression ""she is nice"", calls 
    for different interpretations. The word 
    ""nice"" could mean 
    ""caring, kind, accommodating, beautiful, 
    and other virtues. Another aspect of ambiguity of utterance is 
    seen, when an utterance is seen, when an utterance requires a true 
    or false response which cannot always be true or false. That is to 
    say, the utterance can be interpreted as true under a set of 
    conditions in a possible universe and false under another. Lyons 
    (1977:.169) observes: ""it there is a possible 
    world in which a sentence is both true and false, we can say that 
    the. sentence expresses two district propositions.
Also seen as a problem in meaning analysis is the fact that what 
    does not exist for a particular person or people, does not feature 
    in their speech and has no name or meaning for them (Udofot 
    2004:.136). What this means is that object to which humans 
    refer in their utterance have meaning only when they are within 
    their knowledge. They may not necessarily be objects that exist. If 
    such objects are mentioned outside the knowledge of the hearer(s), 
    it brings a serious problem in its analysis.
In the same vein, absence of the shared knowledge, as well as 
    the beliefs, conventions and presuppositions between the speaker 
    and the hearer can cause a very serious problem in the analysis of 
    the meaning of a given utterance. The presence of these contextual 
    features is important for a proper interpretation of an 
    utterance.
Another problem associated with meaning analysis is subjectivity 
    and introspection of concepts. It is difficult to have objective 
    meaning of words and utterances if everyone has to look into the 
    mind. Haas (1973:.20) said 'an empirical science 
    like linguistics cannot be content to rely on a procedure of 
    looking into their minds; each into his own"". Also, 
    some theories define meaning in terms of ""symbol - Image - 
    Referent relationships"" which only apply to concrete things 
    not obstructions. For instance, one cannot see the mental picture 
    of liberty, air; courage 
    courage and so on.
Moreover, the fact that people have different ideas about things 
    is a problem in meaning analysis. Udofot (2004) has it that ""a 
    well described picture can be perceived differently by different 
    people depending on their intellectual capacities, power of 
    imagination and backgrounds ( p62). 
    A person who has not experienced an eclipse of the sun can never 
    arrive at having a clear image of it no matter how well it is 
    described. Potter (1957) in his summation had it ""that 
    many people think through movements, gestures, ritual acts and many 
    other ways instead of seeing with the mind's eye.
Also, not all concepts are observable. This is viewed as a 
    problem in meaning analysis. As earlier stated, abstract nouns for 
    instance, are not observable. To explain a word like 
    ""nice"" one would say something like 
    beautiful, hand 
    some, charming,"" assuming that the 
    hearer already knows in his mind the meaning of these words. In 
    doing this one has to go to the mental bank where the meanings of 
    the words used in explaining another word are stored.
Furthermore, interpreting meaning based on the 
    in image visualized by the hearer is a 
    shortcoming in meaning analysis. Here meaning is conceptualized in 
    terms of the image that a particular object calls up in the mind 
    which is associated with the world. The image conceptualized may be 
    false. For instance, the difference between a hen and duck can 
    easily be visualized by calling up their images but scientifically 
    one would have to resort to descriptions using such terms as + LONG 
    NECK (Udofot 2004:.142).
It could also be however established as a problem the situation 
    where propositions vary depending on the time and place of 
    utterance. This means that every utterance occurs in a particular 
    spatio-temporal situation (Lyons; 1968:.413). This consist of 
    the speaker, the time of speech, the person spoken to, the action 
    of the speaker and hearer at the time and the other object and people also present. Lack of knowledge of all these can 
    seriously hamper meaning analysis.
Finally, a problem is viewed where many expressions used in 
    natural languages do not have single referents. For instance, the 
    expression ""that young-man is my brother"". One cannot 
    maintain whether a true or false proposition is expressed without 
    considering who the speaker and the reference. Also one may not 
    actually know the extent of relationship between the speaker and 
    the referent. Is he a biological brother, cousin, a male family 
    member or member of the same denomination?
A CURRENT THEORY WHICH HAS REASONABLY ADDRESS THESE 
    PROBLEMS.
A current theory recommended which has reasonably address the 
    above stated problems associated with the analysis of meaning in 
    natural languages is the pragmatic theory. Pragmatics according to 
    Levinson (1983:.24) is the ""ability of language 
    users to pair sentences with the context in which they would be 
    appropriate"". Pragmatics has a 
    ""user-centred"" description of language.
Pragmatics theory enables one to interpret not only the literal 
    meaning of an utterance but also the meanings that 
    drive from the nouns of formality 
    and politeness. This formality exists in the environment where the 
    language is used couple with the unstated meanings gotten from the 
    shared previous knowledge of the speaker and the situation in which 
    the utterances are used. Pragmatics is a recommended theory because 
    it is eclectic in nature. This means that it is all encompassing. 
    It incorporates the dimensions of context, concept, culture, 
    deixis, presuppositions, implicatures, besides paralinguistic 
    features in the interpretation of meaning. Pragmatics more or less 
    gives a comprehensive analysis. Pragmatics takes into account both 
    observationble 
    and unobservable aspects of a language events. According to Ndimele 
    (1997:.117) it cuts across ""the choices the users make, 
    the constraints they encounter in using their language for social 
    interaction and the effect their use of language has on other 
    participants"".
CONCLUSION
The paper looks at the problems associated with the analysis of 
    meaning in natural language. The 
    problems cut across graded boundaries, ambiguity, absence of 
    objects in a particular society; absence of shared knowledge, 
    beliefs, convention, subjectivity and introspection, perception, 
    multiple referents for a particular object among others. Pragmatics 
    has been discussed as a current theory which has reasonably 
    addressed these problems.

NigerianEnglish,can,"In fact, far from being a ""sales pitch ,"" a customer meeting should be a quest to come up with ways that you the customer can help each other to become more successful",dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,SkHo_22,"How to nurture customer relationship during 
    meltdown
Step one: Decide that you want to have more fun in your 
    job
Traditional wisdom says that the purpose of having better 
    customer relationships is to sell more products to those customers. 
    However, while higher sales figures are a natural by-product of 
    better customer relationships, the real reason to have better 
    customer relationships is to make the job of selling more fun and 
    fulfilling. Think about it this way: wouldn’t you rather be 
    spending time with people whom you like, and who like you in 
    return, than trying to manipulate people into buying things that 
    they may not want or need? Talking with people, and learning about 
    their lives, is inherently interesting and fun, provided your goal 
    in building a relationships isn’t self-serving. In that context, 
    selling is merely a way of helping the person with whom you have a 
    good business relationship, rather than an end in itself.
Step two: Be someone who attracts good customer 
    relationships
Customers choose to have relationships with sales reps who 
    exhibit four key attributes:
Professionalism
: There’s a huge difference between 
    professionals and amateurs. People want to do business with 
    individuals who are serious about what they do, and who are willing 
    to take the time to achieve a deep understanding of their craft. A 
    good way to increase your level of professionalism is to read the 
    trade journals for your industry that hone your business 
    skills.
Integrity: Integrity is being as good as 
    your word. If you say you’re going to do something, then your 
    customer knows it will be done. Integrity is also exhibited when 
    you’re willing to take a stand, even when it’s unpopular with you 
    customer or your company. That does not mean being adversarial, but 
    rather having the ability to make decisions based upon what you 
    know is right.
Caring: People value relationships with 
    people who care about them. A good way to show that you care about 
    a customer is to listen, really listen, to what the customer has to 
    say.
Knowledge: People respect people who have 
    some kind of unique knowledge. This doesn’t mean that you become an 
    expert on every product or service that you sell, but it does mean 
    that you have knowledge that is of value to the customer.
Step three: Align your thoughts and behaviours to reliably 
    generate trust
Who you are is only half of the equation. Your ability to build 
    customer relationships will also depend upon your thought processes 
    about yourself, about customers and about the process of selling. 
    Ideally you want all three of these aligned and congruent. Here’s 
    how.
Integrate the right mind-set
. If you want people around you to value having 
    a relationship with you, you must truly believe that relationship 
    building is important. You must also believe that you honestly have 
    something of value to offer.
Get curious about people. People are drawn 
    to those who show true interest in them. Curiosity about people is 
    thus a crucial element of relationship building. Having an abiding 
    fascination in others gives you the opportunity to learn new things 
    and make new connections.
Be reliable in your actions. A customer’s 
    ability to trust you, and thus be willing to have a relationship 
    with you, is dependent upon showing the customer that your 
    behaviour is consistent and persistent over time. When a customer 
    can predict your behaviour, that customer is more likely to invest 
    you with trust.
Step four: Approach meetings as relationship-building 
    opportunities
Every customer meeting is an opportunity to build or strengthen 
    the relationship, provided you remember that the messenger (who you 
    are) is much more important than the message (what you to say). In 
    fact, far from being a ""sales pitch
    ,"" a customer meeting 
    should be a quest to come up with ways that you the customer can 
    help each other to become more successful. To do this, you must 
    follow the following three touchstones.
Seek the truth
. You want to 
    fine out if you really have something that can help the 
    customer. To do this, the meeting must be a quest to discover the 
    real areas where the two of you can work together. Quick tip: your 
    customer knows that you’re telling the truth when you’re not afraid 
    where to say something negative (the true) about your product or 
    company.
Keep an open mind
. When you walk into a customer meeting 
    absolutely convinced that the customer needs your product or 
    service, the customer will sense you’re close-minded and become 
    close-minded in return. If, by contrast, you’re open to the idea 
    that the customer might be better served elsewhere, the customer 
    will sense that you’ve got his or her best interests at heart and 
    will be more likely to listen to what you have to 
    say.
Have a real dialogue. A customer meeting 
    should be a conversation, not a mere sales call. This means that 
    you should be listening to the customer at least half of the time 
    that’s spent at the meeting. Furthermore, the dialogue should be 
    substantive and about real business issues, not just office patter 
    or chit-chat about sport.
Step five: Maintain and deepen relationships with 
    inexpensive, thoughtful acts
A good way to show that you care about people is to notice their 
    interests and then fine small ways 
    to make them happy. For example, suppose your best customer is a 
    big football fan. You might call up the local newspaper in your 
    area (where the team is based) and arrange to have the Sunday 
    sports section sent to that customer each week. In some cases, a 
    simple telephone call when you’re in the area – even if you don’t 
    have time to visit that customer – is enough. The key concept here 
    is ""inexpensive."" You want to show that you care, not 
    make the customer feel obligated to buy.

    write to you because I know you can help
firstly there have been many accident on 
    the way each blessed day and also m-any children have 
    been killed due to env-ironment of my 
    home town.
Furthermore Secondly 
    the road has caused us many damages like our goods can not be 
    tran-sfer to the market just because of the rough road we 
    have and also, they can not bring goods from outside to my 
    home town to sell. we have been 
    using our head to pack the goods or walk all the way from home to 
    the market
Furthermore during raining season after 
    the rain the road will filled with water because it a clay soil 
     That is  1 
    word after the rain you have to follow the bush before 
    going out to the main road where you can get a vehicle to take you 
    where ever you are going to 
    
Pls, Sir, we know you can help 
    us through  this condition 
     pls 
     as a chairman of my local gove-rnment you have to do something so that we ur community will be happy for you I 
    pray and hope that my request shall be granted. Enjoy your

NigerianEnglish,can,Acute coughs can be divided into infectious (caused by an infection) and noninfectious causes,epistemic,dynamic,dynamic,PNsc_19,"Coughs Overview
A cough is an action your body takes to get rid of substances 
    that are irritating to your air passages, which carry the air you 
    breathe in from the nose and mouth to the lungs. A cough occurs 
    when special cells along the air passages get irritated and trigger 
    a chain of events. The result? Air in your lungs is forced out 
    under high pressure. You can choose to cough (a voluntary process), 
    or your body may cough on its own (an involuntary process).
Causes of Coughs
The list of possible causes of cough is long and highly varied. 
    Doctors classify coughs into 2 categories, acute and chronic. Many 
    doctors define an acute cough as one that been present for less 
    than 3 weeks. Chronic coughs are those present for more than 3 
    weeks.
Acute coughs can be divided into infectious (caused by an 
    infection) and noninfectious causes.
Infectious causes of acute cough include viral upper respiratory 
    infections (the common cold), sinus infections, pneumonia, and 
    whooping cough.
Noninfectious causes of cough include flare-ups of the following 
    chronic conditions: chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, and 
    environmental allergies.
The easiest way to simplify the causes of chronic cough is to 
    divide them into their locations with respect to the lungs. The 
    categories are environmental irritants, conditions within the 
    lungs, conditions along the passages that transmit air from the 
    lungs to the environment, conditions within the chest cavity but 
    outside of the lungs, and digestive causes.
Any environmental substance that irritates the air passages or 
    the lungs is capable of producing a chronic cough with continued 
    exposure. Cigarette smoke is the most common cause of chronic 
    cough. Other cough-producing irritants include dusts, pollens, pet 
    dander, particulate matter, industrial chemicals and pollution, 
    cigar and pipe smoke, and low environmental humidity.
Within the lungs both common and uncommon conditions cause 
    chronic cough. Common causes include asthma, emphysema, and chronic 
    bronchitis. Less common causes of lung-induced chronic cough 
    include cancer, sarcoidosis, diseases of the lung tissue, and 
    congestive heart failure with chronic fluid build-up in the 
    lungs.
The passages that connect the lungs to the external environment 
    are known as the upper respiratory tract. Chronic sinus infections, 
    chronic postnasal drip, diseases of the external ear, infections of 
    the throat, and use of ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure have 
    all been implicated in chronic cough.
In addition to disease processes within the lung and air 
    passages, diseases elsewhere within the chest cavity may also be 
    responsible for chronic cough. Conditions within the chest known to 
    cause chronic cough include cancer, unusual growth of a lymph node, 
    and an abnormal enlargement of the aorta, which is the main blood 
    vessel leaving the heart.
An often-overlooked cause of the chronic cough is 
    gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). GERD occurs when acid from the 
    stomach travels up the esophagus. This abnormal condition can cause 
    irritation of the esophagus and larynx resulting in the reflex 
    production of a cough.
Cough Symptoms
Although the signs of a cough are self-explanatory, what 
    differentiates the cause of a cough are the associated signs and 
    symptoms. Another important factor in determining the cause of the 
    cough is whether it is acute or chronic.
•Acute coughs have been divided into infectious and 
    noninfectious causes.
•Signs and symptoms that point to an infection include fever, 
    chills, body aches, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, headache, sinus 
    pressure, runny nose, night sweats, and postnasal drip. Sputum, or 
    phlegm, sometimes indicates an infection is present, but it is also 
    seen in noninfectious causes.
• Signs and symptoms that point to a noninfectious cause include 
    coughs that occur when you are exposed to certain chemicals or 
    irritants in the environment, coughs with wheezing, coughs that 
    routinely worsen when you go to certain locations or do certain 
    activities, or coughs that improve with inhalers or allergy 
    medications.
•The signs and symptoms of the chronic cough can be hard for 
    doctors to assess, because many causes of the chronic cough have 
    overlapping signs and symptoms.
• If your cough is related to environmental irritants, it will 
    worsen when exposed to the offending agent. If you have an 
    environmental allergy, your cough may improve when using allergy 
    medications. If you have a smoker’s cough, it may improve if you 
    stop smoking and worsen with increased smoking.

NigerianEnglish,can,"If the doctor and midwives can not detect it on time, he said, they will not know what to do",dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,PNsc_07,"Post-Partum Hemorrhage (PPH)
A joke Bello, 32, gave birth to the first set of sextuplets in 
    Nigeria in February this year. The woman was delivered of the 
    babies by Caesarean Section (C.S). But she developed 
    complications from excessive bleeding at the Olabisi Onabanjo 
    University Teaching Hospital in Sagamu, Ogun State where she gave 
    birth to the babies. She gave birth on Thursday and died on 
    Sunday.
According to figures from the World Health Organization (WHO), 
    published in 2007, Nigeria’s maternal mortality rate is the second 
    highest in the world, after India.
Over half a million women die during childbirth annually around 
    the world, according to the WHO, and Nigeria alone accounts for 10 
    per cent of these deaths.
The rate at which Nigerian women die after giving birth is 
    alarmingly on the increase. The most common cause of maternal 
    mortality in Nigeria today is excessive bleeding after birth which 
    is also known as Post Partum Hemorrhage (PPH).
Dr Abdul Lateef A. Imran of Beachland Specialist 
    Hospital, Arepo, Ibafo, Ogun State, speaking to The 
    Nation, said: ""On a yearly basis, there is more than 
    half a million women who die of PPH. About 80 per cent of the 
    deaths happen in the developing countries, one of which is 
    Nigeria.""
He described PPH as bleeding that is 500mls or more after a 
    woman has been delivered of a baby.
In an extract from Derek LLeweyn Jones’ 
    Everywoman, it is stated that, ""Most 
    women lose between 300 and 800ml of blood after their baby is born. 
    This is of little consequence, as during pregnancy, the woman’s 
    blood volume increases by at least one liter.
""However, if the woman is anaemic, has a forceps 
    delivery, or a caesarian section or has a multiple pregnancy, the 
    blood loss may be serious.""
David Werner, author of Where There is No 
    Doctor, stated that, ""When the placenta comes 
    out, there is always a brief flow of blood. It normally lasts only 
    a few minutes and not more than a quarter of a liter (one cup) of 
    blood is lost. A little bleeding may continue for several days and 
    is usually not serious. Bleeding can often be slowed down by 
    putting the baby to the breast.
""Sometimes, a woman may be bleeding severely inside 
    without much blood coming out. If it seems her stomach is getting 
    bigger, it may be filling with blood.""
Dr Imran identified what usually lead to PPH in the tropics as 
    anaemia. ""Women in the tropics are prone to PPH because most 
    of them are anaemic, even before pregnancy. Most of them have been 
    having below PCV of 30 per cent because of poor nutrition, frequent 
    pregnancy and delivery. Most of them do not wait to recover from 
    previous birth before conceiving again. They do not give adequate 
    spacing. Within a year, they have taken in again, the iron 
    deficiency they suffer from in the last pregnancy, they have not 
    even recovered before going into another pregnancy.""
He further said that, ""In Nigeria, most of the citizens 
    live in the rural areas where they do not have access to 
    qualitative healthcare and skilled personnel. Most of the women 
    would have lost a lot of blood before getting to the right place 
    where they can be attended to. While getting to that place, the 
    frustration of the health system itself and the bureaucracy of the 
    hospital (register, pay, wait for doctor etc.) can frustrate 
    the patient. This is coupled with the fact that the financial power 
    of women is so low. Most women have to wait for their husbands to 
    come before taking a financial decision or get support, even to be 
    able to get a good hospital.""
The Ibafo-based gynecologist said that there are many things 
    that can cause PPH, but atony is the commonest. Atony is a 
    situation where the uterus fails to contract after birth. He said, 
    ""The mechanism that makes bleeding stops is contraction of the 
    uterus, which narrows the vessel at the placenta where the bleeding 
    is coming from and form a clot, Once 
    that is in place, there would not be abnormal bleeding.""
He said further, ""The women who are at a risk of atony are 
    women who have fibroid. It dispenses the uterus and make it 
    difficult for it to contract very well. Also, any condition that 
    leads to enlargement of the womb in the uterus, beyond necessary, 
    like when you have multiple gestation, (twins, triplet, sextuplet, 
    octuplet) the uterus over extended and this does not make the 
    uterus to contract very well, thereby causing bleeding.""
Imran continued by saying that Infection can also cause PPH. 
    Infection occurs when there is product of conception left in the 
    womb, no matter how little. According to him, 
    It will not allow the uterus to contract very well, at the 
    same time, causing a lot of bleeding.
He also said, women who have had multiple scars; either from 
    previous termination of pregnancy or other surgical procedure such 
    as fibroid or caesarian. All 
    these leave scars in the womb. When a placenta is near the scar, it 
    does not shed out easily.
He related the death of women who die from childbirth bleeding 
    with the incompetent hands they often go to for delivery. ""For 
    medical personnel who do not know how to manage this, they will 
    just pull out the placenta and the thing will come out in pieces. 
    All those ones that are left behind will continue to bleed"", 
    he said.
Most of the time, he said further, it happens in the maternity 
    home, traditional birth attendance (TBA) home and they would not 
    know what to do. To make matters worse, the patient would not be 
    referred on time, until it is too late, and the patient will just 
    die like that.""
In continuation, he said that, for a woman to survive it, she 
    has to get to the right place at the right time. If the doctor and 
    midwives can not detect it on time, he said, they will not know 
    what to do. He observed that, those who die as a result of PPH do 
    so because they die in an unskilled hand, either in a church, 
    clinics, herbal home or even with midwives and nurses who have 
    centers all over the place. That is why it is a problem in the 
    developing nation.
In continuation of what cause PPH, Imran said, ""Ruptured 
    uterus, this occurs in women who have 
    ceasarian Section before, but who want to deliver normally 
    at the next opportunity. At times, the uterus can rupture, and if 
    it is not noticed, the woman will just be bleeding continuously. 
    For instance, women who have had two or three deliveries, go to TBA 
    home, and the midwives there apply pressure by climbing on the 
    woman and pressing her stomach from above, so that the baby can 
    come out. In the process, they sometimes rupture the uterus. After 
    the baby is out, the woman will just continue to bleed. If the 
    woman is not taken to the right place, at the right time, she could 
    bleed to death.""
He said that, there is primary and secondary PPH. It happens 
    within 24 hours of delivery, especially from infection. The person 
    does not start bleeding immediately. Secondary PPH is an infection 
    from the retained products. It is not immediate. In this case, the 
    woman would have delivered, she might have even gotten home, and on 
    the third day, she will just discover that she has started bleeding 
    seriously. If there is any product left, bacteria will act on it, 
    then she will start bleeding.
To combat PPH, Jones, the author of 
    Everywoman said, ""In most hospitals, 
    an injection of a drug which makes the uterus contract is given as 
    the baby is born. This method has reduced the risk of PPH 
    considerably. If bleeding continues, there are now new drugs to 
    combat it, and the doctor may put a hand inside the uterus to make 
    sure that no pieces of placenta remain, as these could be causing 
    the bleeding.""
Werner of Where there is no doctor also added 
    that, ""To help prevent or control heavy bleeding, let 
    the baby suck the mother’s breast. This will cause her to produce a 
    hormone (pituitrin) that helps control bleeding.""
Imran contributed by saying, ""The doctor has to be ready 
    for that by doing all sorts of things to ensure the contraction of 
    the uterus, otherwise, the woman will continue to bleed.""
Imran said that PPH can be managed if the person in charge is 
    able to recognise the situation at hand. ""Management starts 
    from anticipation. So, when you see somebody, who is probably in 
    her 40s with five or seven deliveries, the physician would have 
    anticipated that, when she delivers, there might be bleeding, so 
    plans must be ready to tackle it if it occurs,"" he said.
He explained, ""If you do not anticipate a problem, you will 
    not quickly find a solution during emergency. It will happen before 
    you know it. But, when you anticipate problems, by knowing the 
    women at risk; fibroid, multiple pregnancy, multiparity, 
    over-enlarged uterus, then, the health expert will watch out for 
    it.""
In order to decrease the number of women affected by PPH, Imran 
    mentioned some signs that will be noticed so that the woman can get 
    help and survive, if possible. ""When you lose blood, the body 
    wants to compensate for it, and one of the compensation mechanisms 
    is that, the pulse rate will increase, and that means, the heart 
    rate will increase too, and with time, the woman starts flaring the 
    womb, becomes weak (no stamina to do anything), develops features 
    of heart failure, legs will be swollen, congesting accumulation of 
    veins in the lungs, person would not be able to lie down flat, and 
    so on.""
Imran noted that ""PPH is preventable if the woman register 
    in a good health service place and deliver in a skilled hand.
""One of the problems doctors face with pregnancy is that a 
    woman might be registered in a place, but due to labour pains and 
    unavailability of a transportation at the oddest hour, she will be 
    taken to the next available hospital/clinic around. Even in some 
    situations, she delivers at home or inside the vehicle taking her 
    to the hospital.
""Doctors do not like to operate on a woman, and she starts 
    bleeding, he will be faced with the dilemma of either to remove the 
    uterus to save her life (knowing fully well that she will not 
    conceive again). If there is delay, she will continue to be weak 
    and by the time the doctor finalises the decision on removing the 
    uterus, it is already late. So, these are the dilemmas we face as 
    surgeons. For instance, somebody who is just delivering for the 
    first time, and you are removing the uterus, or worse still, the 
    baby is not alive, the doctor will definitely be reluctant to 
    remove the uterus to stop the 
    bleeding.
PPH will lead to death if it is poorly managed.
Dr Imran concluded by saying, ""We need blood to survive or 
    live if a woman is bleeding continuously, the total blood volume in 
    the body is 3.5 litres. So if a woman releases 500ml per 
    minute then, there will be need for an urgent attention.""

NigerianEnglish,can,Vision may become blurred or otherwise impaired and can result in blindness,epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,PNsc_03,"What causes high blood pressure?
High blood pressure can eventually cause blood vessels in the 
    eye to burst or bleed. Vision may become blurred or otherwise 
    impaired and can result in blindness.
Arteries
As people get older, arteries throughout the body 
    ""harden,"" especially those in the heart, brain, and 
    kidneys. High blood pressure is associated with these 
    ""stiffer"" arteries. This, in turn, causes the heart and 
    kidneys to work harder.
Kidney Damage
The kidneys act as filters to rid the body of wastes. Over time, 
    high blood pressure can narrow and thicken the blood vessels of the 
    kidneys. The kidneys filter less fluid, and waste builds up in the 
    blood. The kidneys may fail altogether. When this happens, medical 
    treatment (dialysis) or a kidney transplant may be needed.
Heart Attack
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attack. The 
    arteries bring oxygen-carrying blood to the heart muscle. If the 
    heart cannot get enough oxygen, chest pain, also known as 
    ""angina,"" can occur. If the flow of blood is blocked, a 
    heart attack results.
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
High blood pressure is the number one risk factor for congestive 
    heart failure (CHF). CHF is a serious condition in which the heart 
    is unable to pump enough blood to supply the body’s needs.
The causes of high blood pressure vary. Causes may include 
    narrowing of the arteries, a greater than normal volume of blood, 
    or the heart beating faster or more forcefully than it should. Any 
    of these conditions will cause increased pressure against the 
    artery walls. High blood pressure might also be caused by another 
    medical problem. Most of the time, the cause is not known. Although 
    high blood pressure usually cannot be cured, in most cases it can 
    be prevented and controlled.

NigerianEnglish,can,Your dreams can come true,x,epistemic,dynamic,Pr_15,"Free books for Lagos State public schools
Come September this year which signals the beginning of a new 
    academic session in the country, the Lagos State Government will 
    commence the provision of free books to pupils in all its public 
    schools.
Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babatunde Fashola (SAN), who 
    announced this today, said the programme was in line with his 
    administration’s commitment to provide the opportunity for every 
    child in the State to fully realize his or her potentials.
Fashola who spoke during a courtesy visit by and interactive 
    session with members of the State’s Chapter of Children’s 
    Parliament, said government’s action was also informed by the 
    realization that Education remained the greatest weapon to fight 
    poverty.
“The greatest weapon against poverty is Education. It is through 
    education that you acquire skill. It is with your skill that you 
    can get employed”, the Governor said adding that his administration 
    was also planning to provide such other learning aids like 
    computers.
Fashola, who said the commitment to looking after children of 
    the state was total and unflinching, declared, “We see in you our 
    future. You remind us of our past and you represent for us our 
    future. We are doing it for ourselves because when we must have 
    become old and infirm, you will look after us”.
The Governor noted that the only hope of having uninterrupted 
    power, water supply, well serviced roads, adequate security, 
    efficient and effective police and armed forces was through 
    grooming a well educated and responsible new generation of leaders 
    to take over from the old.
“We want the best for our State and country. We want the best 
    that the country and state can produce to take charge of our 
    resources”, the Governor said, adding that any other option would 
    be disastrous for both the country and the State.
On the various programmes his administration has embarked upon 
    for the benefit of Lagos State children since its inception, 
    Fashola, who noted that children were variously challenged at birth 
    and while growing up, said Government has put many programmes on 
    ground to protect them.
“In the last 363 days this administration has risen up to those 
    challenges. In the area of Security, we have endeavoured to put in 
    place the best security apparatus through our police to protect 
    life and property. Those who challenge the security of our society 
    and our children are being made to face the law, not only through 
    strengthening the police but also through the courts. Our fire 
    services have been upgraded to respond effectively to emergencies 
    while in the area of poverty alleviation, we have embarked on many 
    projects to create jobs for and empower your parents to be able to 
    take care of you”, the Governor said. He added that the 
    introduction of the toll-free 767 emergency dial system was also 
    meant to enhance security through effective information to the 
    security agencies in times of emergency.
Other areas which his administration has addressed for the 
    benefit of children of the state in the last one year, Fashola 
    said, include Health where it has introduced a number of free 
    programmes such as free Malaria treatment for children, HIV/AIDS 
    awareness programmes and advocacy and Information and Communication 
    Technology (ICT) among others.
The Governor commended the parliamentarians for a successful 
    election through which the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker emerged 
    without rancour.
“I am happy that the decision was accepted by all without going 
    to the tribunal. That is the only way to sustain our democracy 
    because when a decision is taken by the majority, the others must 
    abide”.
Also commending this year’s winner of the Spelling Bee 
    Competition, Master Osunbor Daniel, the Governor promised to 
    sustain the competition and told the children 
    , “Only your dream can limit you. Your dreams can come 
    true; we will help you make them come true”.
The Governor later presented a copy of the Child’s Right Law of 
    Lagos State and laptops to the members of the Parliament.
In her remarks earlier, the Speaker, Miss Deborah Adeboyejo 
    commended the State Government for all the programmes put in place 
    for the development of young people in the State noting that 
    children could not be expected to be suddenly patriotic and 
    responsible without being exposed to an environment conducive for 
    development of such virtues.
Earlier in her introductory remarks, the Commissioner for Women 
    Development and Poverty Alleviation Mrs. Orelope Ajoke 
    Adefulire noted that the Children’s Parliament was inaugurated in 
    2003 by the Federal Government to ensure their participation in 
    policy making adding that the inauguration has enabled the 
    Parliament to lobby the National Assembly for the passage of the 
    Law on the Right of the Child.

    ALLOYS
INTRODUCTION
There has been growing interest in the calculating the 
    properties of Na - Cs alloys. 
    (Bhatia and March 1975; Visser et al, 1980; 
    Singh 1981). These model calculations have primarily been concerned 
    with the incipient phase separation in the Na-rich part of the 
    phase diagram. Two origins for the effect have been used. Foremost 
    is the size difference between Na and Cs 
    . (Yih et al 1982). A number of recent 
    calculations have revealed considerably improved understanding of 
    the thermodynamics of molten alloys containing strongly interacting 
    metals (Ashcroft and Stroud 1978; Hoshino and Young 1980).
Na-Cs are alkali metals and their alloys have very interesting 
    properties in the liquid state. They occur together in group 1A of 
    the periodic classification, are strong reducing agents, volatile, 
    can be distilled out of the reaction mixtures and obtained as pure 
    products, and are of bright silvery luster characteristics of 
    metals. Na is used as coolant in the valves of internal combustion 
    engines and in nuclear reactors. The cesium is the most metallic 
    and can be used as reductants in laboratory and industrial 
    processes (Fischer et al, 1967). Various 
    properties of Na-Cs liquid alloy show anomalous behaviors as 
    functions of concentration. The thermodynamics data also reveal 
    anomalous behavior (e.g., the entropy lies below the 
    ideal mixing value, and Scc (0) lies below the ideal value 
    c(1 - c), the Gibbs energy of 
    mixing is small and less than the ideal magnitude (Yih et 
    al, 1982).
The thermodynamic properties of the alloys are important for an 
    improvement in the understanding of the transport properties of 
    these materials, which often form liquid semiconductors (Cutler, 
    1977). The present interest in these alloys is based on the 
    unavailability of recent experimental results on their 
    thermodynamic properties. The experimental results available are 
    only for a limited concentration range of 0 < 
    c < 0.3 (Yih et al, 
    1982), where c denotes the concentration of the 
    A atom in the alloy. These limitations in the 
    experimental results are due to the nature of the alloys. In this 
    present study we calculate all the investigated quantities for the 
    whole concentration range. An empirical approach which is based on 
    the complex formation model of Bhatia and Singh (1980) using the 
    quasi- lattice approximation has been used in the present work, 
    because of its success in explaining concentration dependence of 
    excess-free energy of mixing and other thermodynamics properties of 
    binary molten alloys.
The layout of our paper is as follows: An introduction; Critical 
    discussion of the complex formation model as applied to Gibb’s 
    energy and activity; Results for the concentration -concentration 
    fluctuations Scc (0), the Warren -Cowley short range order 
    parameter and calculation of diffusion coefficients; Discussion of 
    enthalpy and entropy of mixing; Conclusions.
FORMALISM
The fundamental idea is that the properties of a compound 
    forming A-B alloy can be explained on the 
    basis of a quasi- lattice model in which the alloy is treated as a 
    mixture of A atoms, B 
    atoms and Aμ 
    Bv, 
    complexes, all in chemical equilibrium with one another. All the 
    atoms are assumed to be located on the lattice sites.
We assumed that the binary A-B alloy 
    consists of pseudoternary mixture 
    NA = Nc, and 
    NB = N(1-c) g moles of 
    A and B atoms, and a type 
    of chemical complex. Here μ and 
    v are assumed to be integers, 
    c is the atomic faction of 
    A atoms and N is the 
    Avogrado’s number. From 
    the complex formation model (Bhatia and Singh, 1980), we assume 
    that the complex Na-Cs is a stable compound in the solid state and 
    also exists as stable compound in the liquid state.
For the present case of Na-Cs, it follows that it consists of 
    n1 atoms of Na, 
    n2 atoms of Cs and 
    n3 moles of the complex 
    NaCs. Thus μ = 1 and v = 1. 
    From the conservation of atoms, one has

In the equation, c is taken to be the atomic 
    fraction of Na atoms. The Gibbs free energy of mixing of the binary 
    alloy can be expressed as

Here g is the formation of the complex and 
    the first term in the equation represents the lowering of the free 
    energy due to the formation of complexes in the alloy. 
    ∆G represents the free 
    energy of mixing of the ternary mixture of fixed 
    n1, 
    n2 and 
    n3 whose constituents Na, 
    Cs and NaCs are assumed to be interacting weakly with each 
    other.
The Gibbs free energy of mixing of the binary alloy can be 
    expressed as

where the Vij’s 
    (i, j = 1, 2, 3) are average interaction 
    energies and by definition independent of concentration, although 
    they may depend on temperature and pressure.
The equilibrium values of 
    n3 at a given temperature 
    and pressure are obtained from the condition

From Eqs. (3) and (4), the equilibrium values of 
    n3 are given by the 
    equation

Where

The expression for the Gibbs free energy of mixing, Eq (3), can 
    be used to obtain an expression for the thermodynamic activity 
    i.e.,

from which one can write

In order to fit parameters for g and 
    Vij , the first thing to 
    do is to calculate the value of g at the chemical concentration
 using as a starting point,
. The energy parameters 
    v12 
    v13 and 
    v23 are then adjusted in 
    order to reproduce as closely as possible the experimentally 
    measured composition dependence of the Gibbs energy of mixing. 
    Using the above method, we determine the energy parameters for 
    Na-Cs alloys as,

Figure 1 shows that the interaction parameters as given above 
    yield an excellent fit of 
    GM/RT for liquid Na-Cs 
    alloys at 383 K. We note that the only physically meaningful 
    parameter is g/RT because it is a measure of the 
    formation of the complex in the alloy. It is obvious that its value 
    (-0.45 at CNa = 0.5) is very 
    low compared with 2.80 for Fe-Al (Akinlade et 
    al, 2000) and 47.8 for K-Te (Akinlade, 1994). This 
    is an indication that Na-Cs is a weakly interacting system.

Using the interaction parameters given in Eq. (9) together with 
    Eq. (5) one can obtain numerical values of 
    n3, the number of 
    chemical complexes, and thus the values of 
    n1 and 
    n2 from Eq. (1) 
    above. Utilizing the same values of the interaction parameters we 
    show in Figure 2 a comparison of the experimental and computed 
    values of the activity. It is quite clear that our model parameters 
    give an excellent fit to this quantity.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Concentration fluctuations, chemical short range-order 
    parameter, and chemical diffusion
Our main aim was to investigate the phenomenon of ordering in 
    the binary alloys. The first parameter investigated is the 
    concentration-concentration fluctuation in the long wavelength 
    limit Scc (0). This 
    quantity is of good interest because any deviation from ideal value 
     is significant in describing the nature of 
    ordering in a molten alloy. Because 
    Scc (0) is a response 
    function, stability requires it to be positive. A strong response 
    to a concentration-concentration stimulus shows that the system is 
    near phase separation (PS), while a weak one indicates a nearness 
    to compound formation (CF), in other words, 
     implies a tendency for heterocoordination (CF) (preference of 
    unlike atoms to pair as nearest neighbours), while 
     implies homocoordination (PS) 
    ((preference of unlike atoms as 
    nearest neighbours). For a demixing system, 
     . From a theoretical point of view, 
    Scc (0) is important 
    because it is possible to relate it to thermodynamic quantities via 
    the equation

The long wavelength limit of the concentration-concentration 
    structure factors Scc (0) 
    can be determined from equations (3) and (13) respectively. Bhatia 
    and Singh (1980) provided a more reliable expression for 
    Scc (0) which involves 
    ni, its derivative with 
    respect to concentration, 
    vij and its coordination 
    number Z, thus,

where

and

In the above equation

and the prime on the n′ s refers to their 
    first derivative with respect to c.
We note that the Flory approximation for 
    Scc (0) (which is the 
    approximation we have used to express 
    GM can be obtained simply 
    by putting Z = ∞ in the expression above. It 
    follows that by the time the Gibbs’s energy of mixing is correctly 
    fitted one would have determined all the parameters needed to 
    compute Scc (0) . In the 
    present calculation we have used typical value Z = 
    2 for our calculations.
As for the experimental values of 
    Scc (0) this has been 
    determined from activity data (Yih et al, 1982), with the aid of 
    the equation

Essentially, all that is required is to perform a polynomial fit 
    to, the experimental data and then taking an 
    analytic derivative as given in equation 15. Values obtained this 
    way are called experimental values of 
    Scc (0) .
Figure 3 shows the computed and experimental value of 
    Scc (0) as well as the 
    ideal values. We notice that the alloy Na-Cs is compound forming 
    over the whole composition range, this is because 
    Scc (0) is less than the 
    ideal values at all compositions. Also we notice that experimental 
    and computed values are not in good agreement. This might be due to 
    the fact that GM is 
    calculated in the Z = ∞ limit, while a finite 
    Z is used to compute 
    Scc (0). In addition, the 
    choice of NaCs complex gave the best fits available thermodynamic 
    information and we could not achieve better fits using order 
    complexes.
In order to fit the degree of order in the liquid alloy, 
    (Warren, 1969) and (Cowley, 1950), the short range order parameter 
    α1 can be determined from knowledge of the 
    concentration-concentration 
    Scc 
    (q) and the number-number structure factors 
    SNN (q 
    ) . However, in most diffraction 
    experiments these quantities are not easily measurable. On the 
    other hand α1 can be estimated from 
    knowledge of Scc (0) 
    (Singh et al, 1992).

The knowledge of α1 provides an immediate 
    insight into the nature of the local arrangements of atoms in the 
    mixture. For nearest neighbour sites, it can be defined as 
    
where PAB is the conditional probability 
    of finding B-atom next to a given 
    A atom. In terms of the unlike atoms equation 
    (16) can be expressed as

Z being the coordination number of the alloy. 
    From a simple probabilistic approach, one can show that the 
    limiting values of α1 lie in the range


At equiatomic composition, one has −1≤α1 
    ≤1 the minimum possible value of α1 is 
    α1min = −1 and 
    implies complete ordering of unlike atoms as nearest neighbours. On 
    the other hand the maximum value 
    α1min = 1 implies 
    total segregation leading to phase separation 
    α1 = 0 corresponds to a random distribution 
    of atoms.
From Figure 4, which shows the variation of 
    α1 with composition, we observe that it is 
    positive throughout, showing that Na-Cs is a segregating system 
    s over the whole concentration range and symmetric 
    as a function of concentration. In addition, 
    α1 is positive throughout with a value much 
    less than 1, this indicates that Na-Cs is a weakly ordered system. 
    We note that varying the value of Z does not have any effect on the 
    position of the minima of α1 ; the only 
    effect is to vary the depth while the overall features remain 
    unchanged.

A great amount of understanding at the microscopic level of 
    atomic interactions in a binary liquid alloy can be gained from 
    knowledge of the dynamic properties of the alloys.Using the 
    thermodynamic equation for diffusion (Darken, 1967), an expression 
    can be found that relates diffusion and 
    Scc (0) (Singh 
    et al, 1992) thus one can write,

Here, DM is the 
    chemical or interdiffusion coefficient and 
    Did is given as

where DA and 
    DB are observed tracer 
    diffusion coefficients. With regards to  , 
    we note that it approaches 1 for ideal mixing, is greater than 1 
    for an ordered alloy, and is less than 1 for a segregating system 
    s. The ratio is a better measure of order because it 
    does not have a direct Z dependence and thus 
    does not involve discrepancies that could come into play because of 
    the dependence of the results on this quantity. Figure 5, which is 
    a plot of this quantity, shows the existence of maxima at 
    cmm ≈ 0.3 . 
    D is close to 1 and is quite asymmetric.

NigerianEnglish,can,This abnormal condition can cause irritation of the esophagus and larynx resulting in the reflex production of a cough,epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,PNsc_19,"Coughs Overview
A cough is an action your body takes to get rid of substances 
    that are irritating to your air passages, which carry the air you 
    breathe in from the nose and mouth to the lungs. A cough occurs 
    when special cells along the air passages get irritated and trigger 
    a chain of events. The result? Air in your lungs is forced out 
    under high pressure. You can choose to cough (a voluntary process), 
    or your body may cough on its own (an involuntary process).
Causes of Coughs
The list of possible causes of cough is long and highly varied. 
    Doctors classify coughs into 2 categories, acute and chronic. Many 
    doctors define an acute cough as one that been present for less 
    than 3 weeks. Chronic coughs are those present for more than 3 
    weeks.
Acute coughs can be divided into infectious (caused by an 
    infection) and noninfectious causes.
Infectious causes of acute cough include viral upper respiratory 
    infections (the common cold), sinus infections, pneumonia, and 
    whooping cough.
Noninfectious causes of cough include flare-ups of the following 
    chronic conditions: chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, and 
    environmental allergies.
The easiest way to simplify the causes of chronic cough is to 
    divide them into their locations with respect to the lungs. The 
    categories are environmental irritants, conditions within the 
    lungs, conditions along the passages that transmit air from the 
    lungs to the environment, conditions within the chest cavity but 
    outside of the lungs, and digestive causes.
Any environmental substance that irritates the air passages or 
    the lungs is capable of producing a chronic cough with continued 
    exposure. Cigarette smoke is the most common cause of chronic 
    cough. Other cough-producing irritants include dusts, pollens, pet 
    dander, particulate matter, industrial chemicals and pollution, 
    cigar and pipe smoke, and low environmental humidity.
Within the lungs both common and uncommon conditions cause 
    chronic cough. Common causes include asthma, emphysema, and chronic 
    bronchitis. Less common causes of lung-induced chronic cough 
    include cancer, sarcoidosis, diseases of the lung tissue, and 
    congestive heart failure with chronic fluid build-up in the 
    lungs.
The passages that connect the lungs to the external environment 
    are known as the upper respiratory tract. Chronic sinus infections, 
    chronic postnasal drip, diseases of the external ear, infections of 
    the throat, and use of ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure have 
    all been implicated in chronic cough.
In addition to disease processes within the lung and air 
    passages, diseases elsewhere within the chest cavity may also be 
    responsible for chronic cough. Conditions within the chest known to 
    cause chronic cough include cancer, unusual growth of a lymph node, 
    and an abnormal enlargement of the aorta, which is the main blood 
    vessel leaving the heart.
An often-overlooked cause of the chronic cough is 
    gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). GERD occurs when acid from the 
    stomach travels up the esophagus. This abnormal condition can cause 
    irritation of the esophagus and larynx resulting in the reflex 
    production of a cough.
Cough Symptoms
Although the signs of a cough are self-explanatory, what 
    differentiates the cause of a cough are the associated signs and 
    symptoms. Another important factor in determining the cause of the 
    cough is whether it is acute or chronic.
•Acute coughs have been divided into infectious and 
    noninfectious causes.
•Signs and symptoms that point to an infection include fever, 
    chills, body aches, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, headache, sinus 
    pressure, runny nose, night sweats, and postnasal drip. Sputum, or 
    phlegm, sometimes indicates an infection is present, but it is also 
    seen in noninfectious causes.
• Signs and symptoms that point to a noninfectious cause include 
    coughs that occur when you are exposed to certain chemicals or 
    irritants in the environment, coughs with wheezing, coughs that 
    routinely worsen when you go to certain locations or do certain 
    activities, or coughs that improve with inhalers or allergy 
    medications.
•The signs and symptoms of the chronic cough can be hard for 
    doctors to assess, because many causes of the chronic cough have 
    overlapping signs and symptoms.
• If your cough is related to environmental irritants, it will 
    worsen when exposed to the offending agent. If you have an 
    environmental allergy, your cough may improve when using allergy 
    medications. If you have a smoker’s cough, it may improve if you 
    stop smoking and worsen with increased smoking.

NigerianEnglish,can,But even I was shocked when Baami mouthed the refrain 'afterall no religion can say that we shouldn't appreciate the practices of our forebears,dynamic,dynamic,dynamic,nov_11,"The era of monumental change or the monumental era of change, if 
    you prefer that — Take Your Choice (TYC) — is most certainly 
    here.
The scourge of returnees amounting to an insignificant one 
    percent of Baluba set about promptly installing themselves at the 
    topmost level of the nation's pyramid of social 
    stratification. The colonial enterprise assumed a new name once the 
    hundreds of dozens of returnees arrived to assume the 
    colonialists' mantle, and they went about it in style. 
    Structures colluded with forms and content could only hide in shock 
    and embarrassment. The logocentric rules of their ideological 
    precursors energized them, and like the proverbial converts, or the 
    inconsolable sympathizer known to be far more piqued than the 
    bereaved, they sang the song of progress in purely technocractic 
    terms, and terminologies.
As I lay on the opulent foam mattress, my body, my being or 
    beingness, as Baami would have put it, ached all over desiring 
    human contact. What began as respect for the communal mat of Aiyeru 
    soon turned into nostalgia for every face, every known heart in 
    Aiyeru. As Baami's dictatorial rule in our household paled 
    into insignificance in the face of the remoteness of the man I was 
    now encouraged to address as Daddy, my heart ached to reach 
    Maami-Agba to let her know about the transformations that have 
    occured in my life — the transformations she had talked about for 
    so long.
Baami left for Aiyeru two days after the returnee's return. 
    He had talked endlessly with my father the previous nights, and as 
    he got ready to depart Port-city they promised to continue their 
    conversations in Aiyeru upon the returnees' impending visit 
    there. Thanksgiving would be at Our Apostolic Church and the 
    Alayeru must be given a free hand in deciding which of the 
    town's many cultural practices would be appropriate in 
    welcoming a deserving son of the soil who has conquered the waves. 
    Call it excitement, over enthusiasm or what have you. But even I 
    was shocked when Baami mouthed the refrain 'afterall no 
    religion can say that we shouldn't appreciate the practices of 
    our forebears!'
But I've never seen very few people occupy so much space in 
    my entire life: Ralph's room, Liz's room, Living-room, 
    Master bedroom and yet there are still more rooms!
Rooms! Rooms! Rooms everywhere and no people to fill them. My 
    mind flew to Lati and his parents' shack at the lagoon and 
    again the contrast was staggering. Almost all of Lati's 
    predictions had come true to the letter, and that frightened me. 
    How could a boy, my own age, predict the life of the returnees so 
    clearly? Elizabethan Island, Lati had said was where my parents 
    would install themselves, side by side with their own kith, and 
    who, I asked myself are really their kins? The world is mixed — 
    that's what the word Aiyeru reiterates — and it was the first 
    sentence ever explained to me as I began to strew words together. 
    But the logic that informed the mixing in Elizabethan Island eluded 
    me. One knew — without being told — that terrible conflicts lay 
    ahead. Discursive and counter-discursive issues needed urgent 
    settlement or at the very least contextualisation, but where do you 
    begin when objects that one side holds sacred are merely art 
    objects to the other side?
Of my two siblings, Ralph was the most tolerant and tolerable — 
    Liz insufferable. Marked resemblance between Liz and Motunde, I 
    constantly assured myself, was the only reason why I've not 
    snuffed the life out of the child prodigy. She knew as much as I 
    did that the ground between us was inherently quaky, and she did 
    her best to steer clear of me. Of course, Ralph exuded major 
    irritants of his own, but not even his worst excesses could match 
    the unending antics of Liz's favourite playmate Michael the 
    destroyer — so named so as to differentiate him from another 
    Michael in the ever-expanding circle of returnees, both young and 
    old.
Elizabethan Island catered for them all. Huge gardens and their 
    accompanying neatly barbed lawns, each tended by a grown man called 
    gardener, reiterated the opulence of each household. A row of 
    duplexes on one side, a second street sporting lines of neatly 
    arrranged bungalows or still 
    more duplexes on the other. The houses were kept so widely apart as 
    if the occupants were aware of one another's reactionary 
    tendencies and tried to avoid each other's eavesdropping 
    company. In spite of this, gossip flowed from compound to compound 
    as the tribe of gardeners intermingled with the hordes of domestic 
    maids, and the retinue of drivers and houseboys — some of whom were 
    older than the masters of the house but were still called boy! This 
    in turn precipitated unending scandals.
Michael the destroyer, whose aggression didn't match his 
    fighting abilities — is a wild cat of about Liz's age. Among 
    Michael the destroyer's two sisters both of whom were left 
    with their paternal grandmother somewhere in Ekitiland while their 
    mother and father like my own parents went in search of the golden 
    fleece, it is Bukola's antics that provided unending amusement 
    for dwellers of Olanibi Street at Elizabethan Island. Very soon, 
    Bukola's tears became as famous as her memorable sayings. The 
    cause or causes of Bukola's tears vary, but a significant half 
    of it has to do with the dietary dictate of Bukola's returnee 
    father, mother, and a brother who was begotten abroad. Give Bukola 
    pounded yam with okro instead of melon soup and the story would end 
    in tears.
'The dish doesn't match the soup,' or vice versa, 
    Bukola would wail endlessly.
The story doesn't end there too, because for Bukola, yam 
    was the source of life and a recourse to cassava in whatever shape 
    or form is either due to chronic poverty or an excruciating lack of 
    imagination, or both. But the returnees' taste buds — as a 
    result of many years of re-acculturation — had acquired diverse 
    habits. With each returning family, cartons of tin food were 
    unloaded out of which a plethora array of dishes were concocted.
'Maami' — as Bukola insisted on calling her mother in 
    spite of the woman's repeated attempt to make her say Mummy — 
    Bukola would say: 'It's only when the dog is away that we 
    go hunting with the sheep. I thought you should know that if 
    you're really my mother.'
'I am your mother alright and it's the witch called 
    your father's mother whom I suspect of misbegetting you,' 
    Bukola's equally tough-minded mother would conjecture!
And so the battle raged. Then one day — a day which broke and 
    changed the course of the family's history — Bukola said to 
    her lionised mother: 'You're evading my question again 
    Maami. Monmi didn't beget me. She looked after me and my 
    sister Oiu, because you weren't there and it took her combined 
    effort and Olukori's help for her to succeed — or don't 
    you remember again that the long spoon belongs to Kori? You should 
    be grateful to Olukori first and Monmi next, but I've heard 
    you hurl nothing but insults at the two.
'Well you see Bukola, I am a Christian, and that fact alone 
    rules out thanking or even acknowledging Olukori as you call it. 
    And as for your father's mother, as I've told you 
    she's a witch. If only you know what I've suffered in the 
    hands of that woman.'
'But the woman you call a witch is the leader of the women 
    in our Church — do you say that merely because you don't like 
    her?' Bukola — who already stood on equal terms with her 
    mother in terms of physique — often asked.
'Watch how you talk to me young lady. Don't forget 
    that I'm your mother. Yes, I don't like your 
    father's mother, because she has never liked me. And how do 
    you call someone a Christian who mixes respect for God with the 
    worship of idols?'
'We would have to separate the two matters then,' 
    Bukola responded.
'What two matters? Look, I'm not going to stand here 
    all day and argue with you. You eat what is put on the table or you 
    go hungry.'
'I don't mind being hungry, Maami,' Bukola said 
    coolly. 'This land and its people taxed themselves so hard to 
    send you and others like you to go and learn about the white 
    man's power — his secrets — and not to go and become white 
    yourselves. We thought you were going to return with the theories 
    and practices of liberation and not icons of further colonisation 
    and enslavement!'
The crack on Bukola's face could have shaken the earth. But 
    to all consternation and amazement, Bukola took the mother's 
    slap without blinking. The tearful girl whose tears filled buckets 
    over pounded-yam and melon soup not even wincing at the sound of a 
    perfectly delivered, well aimed slap. Incredible. An inward rather 
    than outward strength no one thought existed suddenly manifesting, 
    making her look incredibly beautiful.
'Don't talk to me like that you daughter of a wicked 
    witch.'
'Which witch?' Bukola queried.
'Your father's mother — she is the witch.'
'But I'm not her daughter. I'm your daughter. 
    That means you're the witch.'
Bukola's mother was incensed. Her beautiful face contorted 
    and her shapely mouth twisted into a serpentine curl.
'Oh, so I'm now the witch. It's certainly true 
    what they say that if the farmer is slow in reprimanding the thief, 
    there's nothing stopping the thief from turning round to call 
    the farmer a thief.'
'And whose saying is that, Maami?'
'A human saying.'
'I am glad you're now tapping into humanity's 
    collective storehouse of knowledge and wisdom instead of the 
    monolithic after-thoughts of the land of your sojourn. Yes, Maami 
    you're still one of us. That is one of the wisest sayings of 
    our people — If the farmer is slow in apprehending the thief, it is 
    in the nature of thieves to turn round and accuse the farmer,' 
    Bukola said, breathlessly reappropriating her mother's 
    rhetorical lines.
You've got to be accustomed to mechanical images to 
    appreciate what happened next between Bukola and her mother. 
    Erstwhile concealed and unshed tears flowed freely on both sides of 
    Bukola's smooth cheeks. Her lips trembled as she placed shaky 
    fingers on them to muffle smiles of joy threatening to turn into 
    roaring laughter. Bukola looked at her mother anew — repeating 
    loving entreaties without uttering a single word. In contrast, age, 
    wisdom and experience featured on Bukola's mother's 
    diminutive demeanour and a thin line, like a fading furrow between 
    two heaps of mound, appeared on the mother's forehead. 
    Weariness displaced tiredness and truth prevailed. Bukola took two 
    faltering steps inside the large living-room and stopped as if 
    uncertain. Bukola's tears flowed freely and it was the mother 
    who reasserted control over a precarious situation.
'Come here! You daughter of Olatosa,' the mother 
    said.
'Maami! Omo amufa se mogitn se! 
    Art baba mogunjo! You're the true 
    daughter of your father.'
Bukola's mother laughed mirthlessly, blinked hard in an 
    unsuccessful attempt to stop three solitary flashing drops of 
    tears.
'Get the hell out here Olatunji. This is no sight for 
    sacrilegious souls,' Bukola commanded without even looking at 
    me.
I scrambled to my feet only to fall back into the extra 
    cushioned couch, but scrambled back and stood there like a 
    stupefied chick immobilized and transfixed by the mesmerising hawk 
    displaying its cannibalistic hawkitude. My only path out of the 
    large living-room blocked by Bukola's mother's half-naked 
    brown back. Without turning, Bukola's mother said in a voice I 
    don't think neither I nor Bukola have ever heard before:
'I'm sorry I ever fought you — both of you. Tunji and 
    Bukola there is nothing wrong with your upbringing. We're the 
    ones trying to be what we cannot be. But the story is far more 
    complex than you can both imagine. By picking huge holes in every 
    aspect of the univocality of The Great Tradition, you've 
    managed to poke the darkest origins of a very deep matter. And 
    whoever does that must be shown the discursive bottom of the matter 
    because as our people say, half a reptile does not inhabit the

The introduction of Windows 7 by the world’s leading 
    software producer, Microsoft Corporation, is to herald a revolution 
    in the usage of computers. CHUKS UDO OKONTA 
    examines its features and users’ expectations.
The launch of the long- 
    awaited Windows 7 last week, by Microsoft Corporation, 
    signifies another feat in the Information and Communications 
    Technology (ICT) sector.
The windows, which replace Vista, is said to be designed to meet 
    the trends in the communications sector and enhance human 
    productivity.
According to a recent survey, the production of the computer is 
    said to be the best human invention. To sustain this feat, 
    Microsoft Corporation, has continued to research and develop 
    devices that will aid and promote human existence.
Windows 7 which has the catch phrase: ‘Your PC simplified’, will 
    enable users to instantly locate and open virtually any file on 
    their computers - from documents to emails songs, right from the 
    start menu with just typing a word or two with the windows 
    search.
It also enables users open files and get around their computers 
    fast with the improved taskbar, which helps to pin programmes used 
    often to the taskbar, so that they can be located with a click. 
    Files used regularly are opened without hassles with jump list, 
    lots of open programmes; documents and browser windows are managed 
    easily with thumbnail and full-screen previews of open windows, 
    resize and organise open windows – arranging two windows exactly 
    side-by-side by dragging them to opposite sides of the computer 
    screen and more.
Country Manager, Microsoft Nigeria, Mr. Emmanuel Onyeje, 
    at the launch of the window in Lagos, said that with Windows 7, 
    Microsoft has taken the level of computer improvement higher. He 
    added that one billion windows users across the globe gave

    English, French and Portuguese, adding that Microsoft is working to 
    ensure the windows are available in African languages including 
    Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba within 18 to 24 months.
He said that the Windows will be available in all Microsoft’s

    windows.""
How to tell whether your PC can handle Windows 7.
Here are few handy tips before buying and installing Windows 
    7:
•If your current PC is running Windows Vista then it can also 
    handle Windows 7, no problem.
• If you’re running Windows XP, you need to see if your existing 
    hardware can handle Windows 7. Minimum specs for Windows 7 are: 1 
    gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor; 1 
    gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit); 16 GB available 
    hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit); DirectX 9 graphics 
    device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver.
•If your computer can handle the upgrade, what about the 
    software you use? The rule of thumb is as follows: If your 
    third-party programs work in Windows Vista now, they’ll work in 
    Windows 7.

The Signs, Symptoms, Causes, and Effects... General 
    Overview
We all face different challenges and obstacles, and sometimes 
    the pressure is hard to handle. When we feel overwhelmed, under the 
    gun, or unsure how to meet the demands placed on us, we experience 
    stress. In small doses, stress can be a good thing. It can give you 
    the push you need, motivating you to do your best and to stay 
    focused and alert. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a 
    presentation at work or drives you to study for your exams when 
    you'd rather be watching TV. But when the going gets too tough 
    and life's demands exceed your ability to cope, stress becomes 
    a threat to both your physical and emotional well-being.
What is stress?
Stress is a psychological and physiological response to events 
    that upset our personal balance in some way. When faced with a 
    threat, whether to our physical safety or emotional equilibrium, 
    the body's defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic 
    process known as the “fight-or-flight” response. We all know what 
    this stress response feels like: heart pounding in the chest, 
    muscles tensing up, breath coming faster, every sense on red 
    alert.""
The Body’s Stress Response
The “fight-or-flight” stress response involves a cascade of 
    biological changes that prepare us for emergency action. When 
    danger is sensed, a small part of the brain called the hypothalamus 
    sets off a chemical alarm. The sympathetic nervous system responds 
    by releasing a flood of stress hormones, including adrenaline, 
    norepinephrine, and cortisol. These stress hormones race through 
    the bloodstream, readying us to either flee the scene or battle it 
    out.
Heart rate and blood flow to the large muscles increase so we 
    can run faster and fight harder. Blood vessels under the skin 
    constrict to prevent blood loss in case of injury, pupils dilate so 
    we can see better, and our blood sugar ramps up, giving us an 
    energy boost and speeding up reaction time. At the same time, body 
    processes not essential to immediate survival are suppressed. The 
    digestive and reproductive systems slow down, growth hormones are 
    switched off, and the immune response is inhibited.
The biological stress response is meant to protect and support 
    us. It’s what helped our stone age ancestors survive the 
    life-or-death situations they commonly faced. But in the modern 
    world, most of the stress we feel is in response to psychological 
    rather than physical threats. Caring for a chronically-ill child or 
    getting audited by the company auditors are stressful situations, 
    but neither calls for either fight or flight. Unfortunately, our 
    body doesn’t make this distinction. Whether we’re stressed over a 
    looming deadline, an argument with a friend, or a mountain of 
    bills, the warning bells ring. And just like a caveman confronting 
    a sabertooth tiger, we go into automatic overdrive.
If you have a lot of responsibilities and worries, you may be 
    running on stress a good portion of the time—launching into 
    emergency mode with every traffic jam, phone call from the in-laws, 
    or segment of the evening news. But the problem with the stress 
    response is that the more it’s activated, the harder it is to shut 
    off. Instead of leveling off once the crisis has passed, your 
    stress hormones, heart rate, and blood pressure remain elevated.
Furthermore, extended or repeated activation of the stress 
    response takes a heavy toll on the body. Prolonged exposure to 
    stress increases your risk of everything from heart disease, 
    obesity, and infection to anxiety, depression, and memory problems. 
    Because of the widespread damage it can cause, it’s essential to 
    learn how to deal with stress in a more positive way and reduce its 
    impact on your daily life.
Signs and symptoms of stress
To get a handle on stress, you first need to learn how to 
    recognize it in yourself. Stress affects the mind, body, and 
    behavior in many ways— all directly tied to the physiological 
    changes of the fight-or-flight response. The specific signs and 
    symptoms of stress vary widely from person to person. Some people 
    primarily experience physical symptoms, such as low back pain, 
    stomach problems, and skin outbreaks. In others, the stress pattern 
    centers around emotional symptoms, such as crying jags or 
    hypersensitivity. For still others, changes in the way they think 
    or behave predominates.
Keep in mind that the signs and symptoms of stress can also be 
    caused by other psychological and medical problems. If you’re 
    experiencing any of the warning signs of stress, it’s important to 
    see a doctor for a full evaluation. Your doctor can help you 
    determine whether or not your symptoms are stress-related.
Causes of stress
Top Ten Stressful Life Events
(1) Spouse’s death (2) Divorce (3) Marriage separation (4) Jail 
    term
(5) Death of a close relative (6) Injury or illness (7) 
    Marriage
(8) Fired from job (9) Marriage reconciliation (10) 
    Retirement
The potential causes of stress are numerous and highly 
    individual. What you consider stressful depends on many factors, 
    including your personality, general outlook on life, 
    problem-solving abilities, and social support system. Something 
    that's stressful to you may not faze someone else, or they may 
    even enjoy it. For example, your morning commute may make you 
    anxious and tense because you worry that traffic will make you 
    late. Others, however, may find the trip relaxing because they 
    allow more than enough time and enjoy listening to music while they 
    drive.
The pressures and demands that cause stress are known as 
    stressors. We usually think of stressors as being negative, such as 
    an exhausting work schedule or a rocky relationship. However, 
    anything that forces us to adjust can be a stressor. This includes 
    positive events such as getting married or receiving a promotion. 
    Regardless of whether an event is good or bad, if the adjustment it 
    requires strains our coping skills and adaptive resources, the end 
    result is stress.
Major life changes
Major life events are stressors. Whether it be a divorce, a 
    child leaving home, a planned pregnancy, a move to a new state, a 
    career change, graduating from college, or a diagnosis of cancer, 
    the faster or more dramatic the change, the greater the strain. 
    Furthermore, the more major life changes you’re dealing with at any 
    one time, the more stress you’ll feel.
Daily hassles and demands
While major life changes are stressful, they are also relative 
    rarities. After all, it’s not every day that you file for divorce 
    or have a baby. However, you may battle traffic, argue with your 
    family members, or worry about your finances on a daily basis. 
    Because these small upsets occur so regularly, they end up 
    affecting us the most.
Daily causes of stress include:
• Environmental stressors – Your physical surroundings can set 
    off the stress response. Examples of environmental stressors 
    include an unsafe neighborhood, pollution, noise (sirens keeping 
    you up at night, a barking dog next door), and uncomfortable living 
    conditions. For people living in crime-ridden areas or war-torn 
    regions, the stress may be unrelenting.
• Family and relationship stressors – Problems with friends, 
    romantic partners, and family members are common daily stressors. 
    Marital disagreements, dysfunctional relationships, rebellious 
    teens, or caring for a chronically-ill family member or a child 
    with special needs can all send stress levels skyrocketing.
• Work stressors – In our career-driven society, work can be an 
    ever-present source of stress. Work stress is caused by things such 
    as job dissatisfaction, an exhausting workload, insufficient pay, 
    office politics, and conflicts with your boss or co-workers.
• Social stressors – Your social situation can cause stress. For 
    example, poverty, financial pressures, racial and sexual 
    discrimination or harassment, unemployment, isolation, and a lack 
    of social support all take a toll on daily.
Risk factors for stress
The presence of a stressor doesn’t automatically result in 
    disabling stress symptoms. The degree to which any stressful 
    situation or event impacts your daily functioning depends partly on 
    the nature of the stressor itself and partly on your own personal 
    and external resources.
Effects of chronic stress
Chronic stress wears you down day after day and year after year, 
    with no visible escape. Under sustained or severe stress, even the 
    most well-adjusted person loses the ability to adapt. When stress 
    overwhelms our coping resources, our bodies and minds suffer.
Health effects
Recent research suggests that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of 
    illness is stress-related. The physical wear and tear of stress 
    includes damage to the cardiovascular system and immune system 
    suppression. Stress compromises your ability to fight off disease 
    and infection, throws your digestive system off balance, makes it 
    difficult to conceive a baby, and can even stunt growth in 
    children.
Emotional effects
Chronic stress grinds away at your mental health, causing 
    emotional damage in addition to physical ailments. Long-term stress 
    can even rewire the brain, leaving you more vulnerable to everyday 
    pressures and less able to cope. Over time, stress can lead to 
    mental health problems such as: anxiety depression eating 
    disorders, and substance abuse.
Severe stress and trauma
Severe stress reactions can result from sudden, catastrophic 
    events or traumatic experiences such as a natural disaster, sexual 
    assault, life-threatening accident, or participation in combat. 
    After the initial shock and emotional fallout, many trauma victims 
    gradually begin to recover from its effects. But for some people, 
    the stress symptoms don't go away, the body doesn’t regain its 
    equilibrium, and life doesn’t return to normal. This severe and 
    persisting reaction to trauma is known as post-traumatic stress 
    disorder (PTSD).
Common symptoms of PTSD include:
• Flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, or nightmares about the 
    trauma
• Avoidance of places and things associated with the trauma
• Hypervigilance for signs of danger
• Chronic irritability and tension
• Depression.
PTSD is a serious disorder that requires professional 
    intervention.
While unchecked stress is undeniably damaging, there are many 
    things you can do to control it and reduce its effects.

Concessionaires of Inland Container Depots are at a cross road. 
    They have not been given title documents of the land acquired for 
    the dry port project despite the agreement signed by the government 
    with them.
The Chairman of the Association of Inland Container Depot 
    Operators, Dr Godfrey Shitgurum, has led a delegation to the 
    Minister of State for Water Transportation, Prince John Emeka, to 
    seek government intervention.
He lamented the lack of title documents and licence for the land 
    earmarked for the dry ports as they could not secure 
    financé from banks.
Shitgurum explained that land and title documents were important 
    for seeking financé and 
    investors for the inland container depot.
He itemised problems militating against the successful 
    implementation of the dry port as including lack of infrastructure 
    which entails a functional railway system and tax reliefs.
Shitgurum noted that a functional railway system was central to 
    the success of the government reforms in the maritime service.
He said:""This will bring in more funds into the 
    industry.""
Shitgurum urged the government to grant the operators tax 
    reliefs and strengthen the supervising agency of the ICD project — 
    Nigerian Shippers Council.
He also urged the government to empower the agency to organise 
    seminars and workshops on various aspect of the projects for the 
    dry put operators.
In a statement by the Minister’s Press Secretary Mr. 
    Abiodun Oladunjoye, Prince Emeka assured the operators that 
    government would look into their problem.
He said that it was important for the beneficiaries of various 
    aspects of government reforms to give adequate 
    feed back on the impact of such 
    policies in order to render assistance where necessary to the 
    private sector operators.
Emeka added: ""Once a policy has been taken, we need the 
    feedback to be able to beat our chest as to its effectiveness. 
    Government is not to frustrate any operator.
""It is vital that we open up our hinterland so that we can 
    have other businesses in those areas, not only importers will 
    benefit but exporters because, with more awareness, the farmer will 
    get their produce for export.""
The Federal Executive Council in March 
    , 1996 approved the establishment of ICDs to be carried out 
    by six preferred bidders at six locations — Abia, Borno, Plateau, 
    Oyo, Katsina and Kano States. The idea of building Inland Container 
    De on a Build-Own-Operate and 
    Transfer (BOOT) basis was muted in selected stations in Nigeria.
The purpose was to reduce congestion at the sea ports and 
    enhance easy clearance of goods. Under the arrangement, exporters 
    and importers will not need to travel long distances to take 
    delivery and dispatch cargoes. However, while the official 
    commencement of movement of concessionaries to sites have been 
    carried out in Kano, Jos and Isiala Ngwa, the turning of sod is 
    expected to be carried out in Ibadan, Funtua and Maiduguri 
    , in the first quarter of 2008.

NigerianEnglish,can,"Some children will benefit from extra support from a Learning Support Assistant (LSA), which can help in lessons and at break/lunchtimes",epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,PSsc_05,"Caring for Autism Children
Majority of children with behavioural, attention, 
    language, communication and learning disabilities such as autism 
    are not being identified early enough. But an organisation has 
    decided to see how it could put smiles on the faces of parents in 
    the care of such children, writes Funmi 
    
    Ogundare
Master Chidiebere Nwankwo, (not real name) the second in a 
    family of five, was born like any normal child, but at a stage when 
    he was supposed to be doing things just like his peers, he started 
    exhibiting strange behaviour such as having difficulty with 
    sleeping, eating and toileting, not responding to his name when 
    called, showing an unusual reaction to pain or pleasure, deaf to 
    loud sounds but affected by quiet noises, among others.
With these numerous challenges, his parents got very worried and 
    had to take him to a pediatrician for medical checkup. They were 
    advised to take him to a neuro-surgeon who diagnosed him as 
    autistic.
According to researchers, the disorder is related to over 
    excitability at nerve endings and mostly affects more males than 
    females. To this end, the Zammarr Institute, a non-governmental 
    organisation that supports children with developmental and learning 
    disabilities recently organised a one-day training workshop on 
    ‘Understanding Children on the Autistic Spectrum 
    Disorders: Implication for Families and Teachers.’ 
    The parley was for parents, teachers and social workers.
Founder of the institute, Mrs. Ronke Katagum said more 
    awareness is now being created so that people could be informed 
    about the disorder. She added that it was fast growing and there is 
    no known cure for it. She said, with behavioural intervention and 
    bio-medicals, it would go a long way in ameliorating the problems 
    associated with the disorder.
Asked what spurred her into working with autistic children, she 
    said, “It has been a long standing dream to work with the mentally 
    challenged children. People do associate them with distress and 
    their needs are not being met. I started 1997 by taking courses in 
    area of autism and today I am better for it.”
Katagum called on stakeholders to pay attention to autism, 
    saying, “it does not have a face and a child with autism may look 
    like you and I in most cases. He may be the next president as long 
    as he has the opportunity of getting early intervention which is 
    the key.”
The disorder according to International Development Director, 
    Autism Speaks United Kingdom, Mrs. Eileen Hopkins, is a 
    spectrum of developmental disorders involving impairment in 
    language, social behaviour and certain physical behaviors - with 
    symptoms that range widely in number and severity. She said it had 
    been attributed to biomedical factors such as allergies; vaccines, 
    genetic factors and neuro-developmental factors among others.
She added that parents of children with the disorder may have 
    worries about their child’s development, but should ‘come to terms’ with it, as soon as he or she is 
    diagnosed. Hopkins said people with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder 
    (ASD) usually have difficulties in three areas which included 
    social communication, interaction and imagination. With social 
    communication, she said the child might have difficulty in 
    understanding the social meaning of language and processing words, 
    be very anxious and would be unable to work out what one says or 
    means, not be able to make sense of jokes or sarcasm, misinterpret 
    body language, among others.
On the social imagination, she said the child usually have a 
    poor theory of mind, not understanding the consequence of his 
    actions and not having the flexibility of thought.
In the area of communication, Hopkins said the differences 
    include having less understanding of how to react and behave with 
    other people, and knowing how to use the signs, words and gestures, 
    as well as non-verbal method of communication.
She said teachers should be informed of his or her condition in 
    terms of social interaction and communication, adding, “a 
    child may have difficulties with reading, writing, number work or 
    understanding information, expressing themselves or understanding 
    what others are saying. There should be an Individual Education 
    Plan (IEP) to support them. Some children will benefit from extra 
    support from a Learning Support Assistant (LSA), which can help in 
    lessons and at break/lunchtimes.”
Hopkins noted that the teacher could also take reasonable steps 
    to ensure that the child is not put at a substantial disadvantage 
    and treated less favourably for a reason related to his or her 
    disability.
In helping children with the disorder, Hopkins, emphasised need 
    to increase the efficacy and range of treatment options available, 
    focus on biomedical and technological methods of treatments and 
    interventions.
A parent, Mrs. Aishatu Tukur said maintaining a child 
    with such problems could be very expensive, which requires one to 
    keep on re-assessing them by talking to the doctor, doing more 
    research that would guide them into taking good care of such 
    children. She said if one has to mainstream the autistic children 
    into the regular school, there is a need for parents to inform the 
    school of their situation, adding that it would do no good if they 
    are kept at home.
Another parent who does not want his name in print said it has 
    been very challenging taking care of his second son who was born 
    with the disorder. He said so far, he has been paying a special 
    teacher to cater for him at home. The workshop, he admitted is an 
    eye opener as it would give him more knowledge on steps to better 
    take care for his son. He emphasised the need for parents to give 
    them special attention rather than leaving them on their own.

NigerianEnglish,can,S o there can be lack of an invariable connection between bearer of natural meaning and its meaning,epistemic,epistemic,dynamic,ess_01,"Meaning in Natural Language
This general view of the status of language has enjoyed a 
    lengthy ascendancy. Critics, such as Wittgenstein, have not 
    prevailed. The recent focus by Dretske, Fodor, Pinker, and others, 
    on a semantics for mentalese exists 
    along side followers of Grice, who focus on the role 
    speaker intent plays in determining the meaning in natural 
    language. All hold that the principal bearers and determinants of 
    semantic properties are something other than natural language.
There is an alternative to the view that natural language has 
    meaning only that is derivative, as an encoding of thought and the 
    primary bearer of meaning. Since the cardinal aim of language is to 
    convey information about how things are viewed in the world, in 
    consonance with Locke's dire warning that taking words as 
    standing ""for the reality of things"" is 
    a perverting the use of words, and brings 
    unavoidable obscurity and confusion into their 
    signification, whenever we make them stand for 
    anything but those ideas we have in our own 
    minds.
In the analysis of how the meaning of natural language can be 
    understood as a special case of natural meaning. Language, of 
    course, is at least complicated by the presence of intelligent 
    language users. It is arguable that linguistic meaning is as much 
    like natural meaning as it could be, given the presence of an 
    intelligent agent in the causal web linking world and linguistic 
    representation.
The physical systems designed to convey information, 
    non-intelligent instruments that are such that their display states 
    mean one thing or another. Having developed a case for a meaning 
    for linguistic displays that is related to natural meaning, three 
    ways are set out in which meaning for natural language might be 
    understood as derivative of natural meaning. Then, let us 
    reconsider the arguments at the beginning of Paul Grice's 
    classic paper, 
    Meaning, to see if there is as great a difference between 
    natural meaning and linguistic meaning as Grice makes out.
Over the years since Grice' s ""Meaning"" appeared, 
    attention to his work has largely focused on his theory of 
    non-natural meaning. Independently, others have been developing 
    accounts of various types of natural meaning. Much of this work has 
    been done by Fred Dretske and Jerry Fodor, who have been interested 
    in understanding the meaning of mental representations in terms of 
    information they carry. While many have rejected Grice's 
    highly intellectualized theory of meaning, as far as I know they 
    have not discussed Grice's original distinction of the two 
    types of meaning. That distinction remains very interesting, and it 
    is useful, in light of subsequent 
    developments, to revisit his 
    paper.
Grice begins by making a distinction between two types of 
    meaning, then in the rest of the paper he attempts almost exclusively to the second of these, which 
    he calls ""non-natural meaning"". At the 
    very beginning of the paper, Grice invites readers to consider 
    three sentences having to do with meaning:
""Those spots mean measles.""
""Those spots did not mean anything to me, but to the 
    doctor they meant measles.""
""The recent budget means that we shall have a hard 
    year.""
These are all cases of natural meaning, or, following Grice, 
    meaning(n). Note that not all bearers of natural meaning are 
    natural events or facts - the last example is a budget. Generally, 
    natural meaning concerns symptoms or signs or some state of 
    affairs. Other examples might be ""smoke means fire"", 
    ""that drop in barometric pressure means rain"", and 
    ""the fact that the car is exhausting blue smoke means that it 
    is burning oil."".
In the cases of natural meaning, the connection between the 
    bearer of natural meaning and the state that it indicates does not 
    owe to agency. But even in cases like these one could suppose that 
    although no agent is a component of the causal connection, 
    nevertheless the existence of the causal connection itself is the 
    result of an intelligent agent. For example, one could suppose that 
    God has established the connection between measles and its 
    characteristic red spots, or between fire and smoke, perhaps just 
    so that we might know when someone has measles or that there is a 
    fire. If God were to act in these ways, he would be what Dretske 
    has called a ""structuring cause"" - He 
    would cause it to be the case that measles cause red spots, or that 
    fire causes smoke. The meaning of smoke and spots would still be 
    natural meaning, for God would not on each occasion of the 
    appearance of spots or smoke cause them to appear. Rather He would 
    have arranged things so that in the ordinary course of things, 
    measles cause red spots and fire causes smoke, so that from red 
    spots one may infer measles, and from smoke one may infer fire.
Cases where natural meaning is at work as the result of 
    structuring agents are particularly interesting for exploring the 
    connection between semantics and pragmatics, and the relation of 
    natural and non-natural meaning. Accordingly, considering the 
    special case of instruments, devices, which are designed to convey 
    information about some condition. These have, as it were, 
    artificial natural meaning.
The lights and gauges on the instrument panel of a car indicate 
    various facts about the condition of the vehicle. That the leftmost 
    light is on may indicate that the oil pressure is low. Or, as we 
    might also put it, that the light is on means that the oil pressure 
    is low. Although the light is an artifact, it functions as an 
    indicator or symptom of states of affairs. Statements about what 
    the display states of an instrument mean have the same logic as the 
    natural meaning of red spots on the skin and clouds in the sky. 
    Namely, they support inference to certain states of affairs, and it 
    they do not support inference to anyone meaning anything by turning 
    on the light. It is less clear (to use another one of Grice's 
    tests for non-natural meaning) whether they support inference to 
    something of the form:
The fact that the leftmost light is on mean ""the oil 
    pressure is low"".
In part this uncertainty, at least on my part, is because I am 
    not sure that this claim, that a fact means a sentence, is 
    coherent. But perhaps we could say :
The fact that the leftmost light is on means the same as would a 
    talking car that said, ""the oil pressure is low"".
This would relate the meaning of one state of affairs, the fact 
    that the light is on, to the meaning of another state of affairs, 
    one that involves producing an instance of a sentence. This at 
    least seems coherent, unlike Grice's own example involving a 
    quoted sentence. In any case, it seems reasonable to suspect that 
    Grice' s example has paraphrases that are coherent in 
    idiolects other than his own.
The oil pressure light can malfunction. Then its being on might 
    not mean that the oil pressure is low. Of course, it is supposed to 
    mean that the oil pressure is low. And it usually means that. But, 
    if it is malfunctioning, that is not what its being on now means. 
    This may appear to be a difference with some forms of natural 
    meaning, where there is an invariable connection between the thing 
    or state said to have the meaning and the meaning. But it is not 
    unusual even with paradigms of natural meaning for the connection 
    not to be invariable. Clouds that usually mean storms sometimes 
    appear without the storms, (and the storms may arrive unheralded by 
    any clouds). Most disease symptoms can appear in a variety of 
    conditions. S o there can be lack of 
    an invariable connection between bearer of natural meaning and its 
    meaning. We might then say ""x usually means p"". Common 
    simple single-purpose dashboard indicators are always each directly 
    connected with the sensors for the conditions they indicate. Such 
    single purpose indicators 
    may be supplanted by more sophisticated indicator systems. And in 
    order to understand meaning, it may be useful to consider what 
    would happen to meaning in more sophisticated indicator systems.
Now let us turn to reconsider the rest of Grice's 
    distinction between natural and non-natural meaning. Grice gives 
    two examples of what he subsequently calls non-natural meaning, and 
    then he draws five conclusions about the difference between natural 
    and non-natural meaning. His examples:
""Those three rings on the bell (of the bus) mean 
    that the bus is full.""
""That remark, 'Smith couldn't get on 
    without bis trouble and strife,' meant that Smith found his 
    wife indispensable. ""
With regards to these, Grice says that it is characteristic of 
    such cases of non-natural meaning that one can say ""x means 
    that p, but in fact not p"". Thus his first conclusion is:
1. Using the first of these, I can as well say, ""But 
    it isn't in fact full - the conductor has made a 
    mistake""; and I can use the second and go on, ""But in 
    fact Smith deserted her seven years ago.""
However it seems to me that this may not be true of the bell 
    ringing example! If the bus is not full, then those three rings on 
    the bell did not mean that the bus is full. Perhaps they are 
    supposed to mean that the bus is full, and perhaps they usually 
    mean that the bus is full, and perhaps they were intended to mean 
    that the bus is full, but they did not in fact mean the bus is 
    full. Similar considerations apply to the second example. The 
    remark - Smith' s remarking - did not mean that Smith finds 
    his wife indispensable, although it is plausible to suppose that it 
    was intended to be taken by Smith's auditors to mean that.
Also, as mentioned above, there appear to be cases of natural 
    meaning where there is not an invariable connection between a type 
    of sign and a type of indicated state of affairs. Thus, I can say 
    ""spots like those usually mean measles, but not in this 
    case."" And one could say much the same of the three rings of 
    the bell on a bus not yet full.
Grice's second point about natural and non-natural 
    meaning:
I can argue from the first to some statement about 
    ""what is (was) meant"" by the rings on the bell and from 
    the second to some statement about ""what is (was) meant"" 
    by the quoted remark.
This point seems correct. However, these sentences seem 
    elliptical for an explicit attribution of agency to the bell ringer 
    and the remarker. It is not that something is meant by the quoted 
    sentence, rather it is meant by the speaker in using the quoted 
    sentence. Compare a statement about what was accomplished by blows 
    to the midriff - this presumably is a covert attribution of agency, 
    elliptical for what x accomplished by x's blows to the 
    midriff. Similarly, in speaking about what was meant by 
    rin gs on a bell, I am speaking 
    about what x meant by x' s rings on a bell, or perhaps in the 
    case of meaning, what x intended to mean by x's rings on a 
    bell. The construction attributing meaning of this sort to bell 
    rings and remarks instead of an agent may be a natural 
    accommodation in cases where we don't know who the agent 
    is.
Taking into account from the first sentence to the conclusion 
    that somebody (viz., the conductor) meant, or at any rate 
    should have meant, by the rings that the bus is full, and I can 
    argue analogously for the second sentence.
Here Grice appears to be aware for the first time that we might 
    say something about what the conductor should have meant, by the 
    rings on the bell. But he does not seem aware that doing this 
    creates difficulties for his theory. For he later goes on to hold 
    that ""A meant(nn)something by x"" is 
    (roughly) equivalent to
But the last clause doesn't make sense - the conductor 
    presumably did intend the rings of the bell to produce an effect in 
    an audience, so what is the point of saying that he should have 
    done this? After all, if he should have intended, but did not 
    intend, to produce an effect in the audience, then presumably his 
    rings on the bell don't mean(NN) anything at all.

Hi Mazi ,
Merry Christmas and a prosperous new year mazi 
    . How are you doing?
Could you tell me why l cannot reach you with the phone number 
    you supplied me? l have added 00 to  using eurocity 
    card meant for W.Europe, USA and Canada 
    but was told that l was not allowed to reach this destination 
    (which cannot be true because a colleague reaches his Polish family 
    with it).
l'm waiting to hear from you soonest.
Cheers
Mazi ,
Thanks for your last mail. The dates you chose have sorted out 
    my troubles and confussion. 
    They have solved 's proposed 
    UK visit, even though he has not told me whether or not this 
    academic trip will enable him to see me. But I don't want to 
    take anything for granted. Whether he replies to my inquiry or not 
    has now been overtaken by events. Come any date in April now I will 
    be around, by God's grace. Then on May 10th, I will be 
    cracking jokes with you physically; take some strolls with you on 
    the 11th and on the 12th I will be headed home.
No, my human angel will not be travelling with me. I don't 
    want some uncalled-for attitudes. But the other angels will be my 
    bodyguards.
Please do not fail to let me know what to expect so that I will 
    start to prepare myself. First, I have been reliably informed that 
    I will need someone to take me from the airport since Polish 
    citizens on the roads or vehicles have no business with the 
    Queen's English.
Remain belssed as we keep in 
    touch.
Cheers.
Mazi ,
Please could you look at the dates below and tell me the one you 
    think will be good for you. The earlier I choose a date and make a 
    booking the cheaper the airfare becomes for me as 
    bro  
     is not forthcoming with the dates 
    he will be in the UK in April. I can't keep waiting for him 
    indefinitely, not even my voice mail has been responded to on his 
    return from Naija. It appears he is very 
    busy so I can't press him further on coming back.
The dates are: 23-25 April, 1-4, 10-12, 17-19 May. As it suits 
    you. If I spend one quality day with you it might help, isn't 
    it?
Cheers.
Mazi ,
Thanks for writing back so soon.
This age and times no longer require registration of business 
    for people to look for means of survival. How could you forget 
    this? I do not need a registration of those Ltds to buy a car from 
    Poland and send to Nigeria if we can find it cheaper there, or do 
    I? Yes, that is what I am talking about. Make your 
    inquries about what we can be 
    buying from there that are cheap and send to someone like 
      to dispose for us in 
    Lagos, take his cut, and send ours. Money? We can always use my 
    credit cards which I will keep repaying bit by bit if are sure of 
    some profit. We are not getting younger and retirement age is fast 
    approaching.
Thanks for your prompt invitation. I am actually thinking of 
    March/April so that I will recover from my US trip. If your 
    itinarary is ok in those 
    months, especially April you let me know.
Bless you. Thanks for your pic which 
    refused to get larger than the miniature.

Mazi ,
Bless you. Thanks for your mail at last.
It is true that I have become a traveller looking for any 
    international rather than local business. If you know what we could 
    get cheap in Poland and sell it elsewhere to make money please do 
    let me know.
The time being wasted doing one job and not realising anything 
    tangeable can be frustrating. I 
    have always told those who have the ear to listen that the Whiteman 
    has designed things such that you will eat and clothe yourself from 
    any job you do. Then pays all the taxes and bills and have little 
    or nothing to save at the end of the month. While this is happening 
    people home keep expecting you to send them elephants each 
    month.
So, I have decided to move around to see what to do. If it 
    clicks then the present job will go for good.
When you take a good look at the calender could you tell me the 
    month I could possibly check you up in 
     . When this is done I will also look at the suggested dates and 
    tell you how they run with my work roster which has been drawn to 
    the end of the year. I will spend two to three days with you.
Cheers and remain blessed.

Mazi ,
Happy New Year to you and to your family!
Thanks for your mail. It is good to read that you are ok and in 
    good spirit despite the sad situation at home, especially with 
    .
Did they stop your pay on the grounds that you have overstayed 
    the approved time?
How are you going about fighting the stopped salary? I know that 
    your physicalprescence will 
    make a difference but some brethren who are lecturers there can 
    also make some moves for you.
Your wife should be strong for you and for the children at this 
    time and pick up her healing from the Lord. I know it may be hard 
    for her but she does not need to give up at this eleventh hour when 
    you have made some in-roads already.
How is your programme progressing? What areas of breakthrough 
    with your acada at the moment?
I spent the Christmas period with the 
    s. He could not lay hands on your 
    number, we all would have said merry Christmas to you. My own phone 
    went dead as I did not take my charger with me else I would have 
    checked for your number.
I came back from  and picked up 
    some of those fevers and coughs and 
    cattarah that must have been hiding somewhere since I 
    returned from Nigeria. I have been out of job as a result for a 
    couple of days now. I dragged myself to check mails now.
Please do write again soon.
Bless you.

Mazi ,
Please accept our verbal Christmas card and greetings.
It is quite unfortunate that I have not come your way for a long 
    time now. I hope you have been hearing 
    form your wife and children? Do you have a last minute plan 
    to travel home in the next couple of days like you did last year or 
    is it two?
I was home in November and stayed for four weeks, returning on 
    the 18th of December. I produced some tracts for use by churches 
    and fellowships.
I shall say more on this later.
Cheers.
Mazi ,
Our spirit is one. As I was telling myself that it is long 
    overdue to do you a mail little did I know that you were already in 
    my mail box waiting for me.
Bless you real good. The Good Lord has always been faithful to 
    those who put their trust in Him.
My brother, I hope you are doing fine body, soul and spirit? 
    How bookuru? 
    Ma ndi ulo gi? God 
    will bring us together one day. I have applied for the oyibo 
    man's naturalisation. At the most it will take seven months to 
    materialise. They say the volume of application is great. That will 
    be followed with the application for the corresponding passport 
    after which I could travel with ease. The devil is fighting using 
    human agent to deny me the opportunity but the battle is the Lords. 
    By His grace, my hands are clean in not planning evil against 
    anyone therefore I am not afraid.
How is your work doing? Have you been learning Polish language? 
    I told my Polish colleagues that it might take me over 20 years to 
    learn the swiswiswi they speak here.
Please write again soon and speak much this time around.

Mazi ,
Thanks a lot for your mail. God bless you real good.
I am happy that you have got some dates at your disposal. I took 
    a look at the visa requirement for Poland and was surprised that 
    one can even go to USA ten times over before one can receive Polish 
    visa. I hope to give you extracts of what I found out soonest.
The whole thing looks like a code which needs to be cracked. I 
    shall find a way though, even if it may take time. But by 
    God's grace I will see your face one day, God keeping us 
    alive.
""See you again soon""

Mazi ,
It is nice reading from you. More importantly to know that you 
    are kicking fine like Nigeria's under 17 soccer world 
    conquerors. But I wish you are sharing from the bounties which the 
    country is showering on them.
I am happy that you are working hard to finish in record time. 
    The Lord will grant you that prayer in Jesus's name.
Yes I had always thought of retraining (not taught, as you put 
    it, since I am not sure of teaching). The problem really is that I 
    am not sure if I can raise the type of fees for education down here 
    after which one is not too sure of getting job with better pay as 
    our age continue to add. The youth now have an edge.
Is it like  
     who left the comforts of UNN and 
    took his family to settle in the US only to do all kinds of 
    minial jobs including working in 
    post office.
Someone who should have become a 
    prof long ago taking some good N200 000 and above per month. 
    When I heard of him last he was not even doing anything. The 
    brother I spoke with in the US two years ago was even promising him 
    a job to do care job with his clinic. I have considered the option 
    of teaching, with a view to training in PGDE to acqauint me fully 
    with the standard here. But one must produce evidence that one has 
    worked with children before of a particular age one desire to 
    teach. The process is like passing through the eye of a 
    niddle.
Mazi , it is really not the best 
    out in oyibo land.
If our country didn't turn out to be so corrupt how could 
    we all desire to leave home where our communal way of doing things 
    are more satisfying. Yes, we have electricity, water, good roads, 
    efficient transportation, jobs (no matter how poor) etc over here 
    but what about other things like relationship? How many people have 
    I visited this year and how many have been here? Maybe one or two. 
    (I was begging someone over a week ago so that I could visit their 
    family. It hasn't worked out). Is this it? What about 
    evangelism and all that? How many people are ready to give you one 
    minute to hear you preach to them? People at home think they are 
    missing heaven by not being abroad. But they don't know they 
    are not missing anything no matter how imperfect our systems may 
    really be.
Anyway, I do not know if I will say that I am confused as to 
    what to put my hands in. My wife has completed a degree and masters 
    degree in pharmacy yet no job for over a year now. Some two/three 
    weeks ago she was pursuing admission into the nursing profession. 
    Now she is frantically looking for job into anything. One of the 
    problems is that our tongue are not easily understood by the 
    average British. So how can you get a job when you cannot be easily 
    understood? Our closest White neighbour says she can understand me 
    but can hardly pick a word when my wife speaks. You must strain and 
    use no 6 to understand what this White lady is saying. I'm not 
    sure you have heard the Typical English person speak. I mean the 
    uneducated ones in particular. Don't mind the news readers. 
    Theirs look more like special English meant for everyone to 
    understand. I can go on and on. In any case, I will still be 
    praying for God to lead me into something that will be more 
    beneficial to me when I leave for home, God willing.
Have I entertained you?
Remain blessed.
Mazi ,
May the Good Lord continue to be your father even as you 
    continue to trust Him.
How are you doing brother, in faraway ? lt has been 
    long and I must apologise for not having knocked on your door all 
    this while.
First, I believe that your health is very much intact and that 
    your family is kept in touch with constantly.How are they doing?
What developments with your acada and teachers and researches? 
    Please keep me updated, including the job search. The last time we 
    spoke you promised to get me informed of any info geared towards 
    looking out for a vac job for you here 
    in the UK. Remember l promised to do all I can to help out if I 
    could get info about a non- 
    recident searching for job over here.

Last week, after my Focus on where you are going article on 
    Business class, I got 500 thank you calls, 50 commendation calls, 
    700 mails in my inbox, 250 text messsages, 17 consultation calls, 3 
    book publishing offers and 12 invitations to speak at a youth and 
    Business seminars and conferences. I was so overwhelmed that I felt 
    like calling everybody back to thank them for calling or sending 
    messages. You really cannot fathom what a single good article can 
    do?
Amongst all my mails, I noticed that 40% of them have challenges 
    or fears in starting up on their own and being their own boss. So I 
    thought I do a piece on that for this week. Being your own boss is 
    one thing but been good at it is another; you can start up on your 
    own but be a failure at it, so in that case you would have been 
    better off as an employee. I have taking time to go through my 
    history and also done research with some top Nigerian and 
    International CEO’s on the secrets of a successful boss. So when 
    you take that bold step as an entrepreneur and becoming your own 
    boss, these are the basics.
THINK OF LOTS OF IDEAS: The very first thing is, just start 
    thinking of lots of ideas. Starts reading a science fiction, 
    futurism, start watching TED... just start writing ideas 
    down. Look for a park, there are so many in Lagos now thanks to 
    Governor Fashola, take time to 
    Research, brainstorm and write down your ideas on a 
    precious piece of paper or better still your laptop, if you have 
    one.
DO NOTHING: And then, this is the crucial step, do nothing. 
    Don't do anything with those ideas. Just keep thinking of 
    ideas and writing them down, and the reason is that in three months 
    most of those ideas are going to be shit. And it's going to 
    take you at least three months, if not six to nine months to get 
    those ideas together. Too many people jump on the first ideas they 
    have and start doing them, and they shut their brain down and they 
    stop thinking of other clever things. This is my own personal test, 
    I called it the pub-test. I spent half of a year in England and 
    Brits are well-educated, which means 
    they're a very tough audience for new ideas. I go to a pub 
    with a friend, it's noisy, we're having a beer, and then 
    about 15 seconds I explain my idea. If they don't stop 
    drinking their beer and pay attention, my idea is not good 
    enough.
It's very simple. It's because a noisy pub, with beer, 
    lots of queue other people around... it's what the 
    Internet is like: there are tons of distractions, there are tons of 
    things pulling people away. Take yourself to a crowded area or a 
    noisy bar; if you're not interesting enough to get someone to 
    look up from their beer, it's not gonna happen. Try again.
RESEARCH IS A GREAT GAIN:just 
    before you decide on what you want to do, think about your 
    marketing options. For example; if you want to go into chalk making 
    business, start by going to the market and have a one on one with 
    the retailer who sells chalk. Go to a market like Oshodi or 
    Tejuosho, if you are not in Lagos, look for a local retail market 
    that consumes your idea of production. Ask him how many sales he 
    makes daily and weekly. By the time you do an analysis of his sale 
    and know the value of the demand then you think of your production 
    and supply chances on the chalk business. Besides the market, also 
    talk to your friends, especially the very blunt ones, they’ll give 
    you a better truth. Trust me, this is really a great gain.
THE ELEVATOR PITCH: Now, think about your product: what this 
    really comes down to, it's some sort of elevator pitch, some 
    sort of very simple explanation.
It's called an elevator pitch because if you're stuck 
    in an elevator with someone famous, let's say Ben Bruce or Jim 
    Ovia, and you want to speak at either of them.
What would you say in those fifteen seconds that would excite 
    him, that would make him take your card, and call you back? If you 
    can’t think of anything in your idea that you can say, then you 
    should brainstorm some more.
WRITE THE FIRST LINE OF YOUR PRESS RELEASE: I can't stress 
    this enough: before you do any work, write the first line of your 
    press release. So many Entrepreneurs’ and companies leave this 
    still later. They make the product, they get it to ship and then 
    they write the press release, and they realize that the first line 
    of their press release is boring. The product is already made, 
    there's nothing you can do: you have a boring product. You 
    need to work the other way around. How is that first line of that 
    press release going to get people interested?
WRITE THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF YOUR HOMEPAGE: Next, think about 
    what your website will look like and write the first paragraph of 
    your homepage. This is the follow one. Someone says, ""Uh, that 
    sounds interesting, tell me more"". You have three or four 
    sentences to get them excited.
HUNT FOR UNIQUE NAMES: This is actually not nearly as important 
    as you would think. A lot of companies like my own Exclusive Passé 
    or even ones my NGO Yesafrica Initiative, are not the best names in 
    the world, but if they're really good ideas and they're 
    memorable, that's fine. It's not a problem 
    
DON'T BORROW MONEY: This is really crucial. Don't 
    borrow money. Figure out how to do the idea extremely cheaply. 
    There are exceptions however depending on how big your idea and 
    start up budget is, but I want to advice that you start a bit of it 
    without borrowing and see how it goes, trust me on this.
MAKE A MOCK-UP: Just like a thriller before a movie, make a 
    mock-up. Show it to people and watch their reactions, see if they 
    are really excited. You can call up your cousins, siblings, parents 
    or friends to present your mock to. Do your presentation like you 
    are before a Bank CEO who you need a business capital from. Gather 
    their reactions and comments and go back to your drawing board 
    
LAUNCH BEFORE YOU ARE READY: And this is crucial. Launch way 
    before you're ready. Get it out there. Start getting feedback. 
    See if the idea is any good, because you might be really wrong. 
    After you pitch at the bloggers, if no-one cared, if you 
    didn't borrow money, you don't have anything invested in 
    it, other than a few months' work. Kill it, start over. You 
    just learned something; you just learned why the idea was bad. 
    Start again
DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB: This is also crucial: don't 
    quit your day job. A lot of people think they need to get funding, 
    quit their day jobs, start with a bunch of partners, and go off. 
    What you really need to do, is get that salary and find time on the 
    weekends, on the evenings, to work on your project, and gradually 
    lower your time commitment to your job. But only quit it once you 
    have enough money. So many people have regretted this part 
    
SALESPEOPLE ARE A BAD IDEA: You also discover that salespeople 
    are an extremely bad idea. The reason is that salespeople require 
    capital and that also generally mean that your idea isn't that 
    good. Your idea isn't that good because it requires 
    salespeople to convince people it's good. If it's good it 
    should convince people on its own. Great products build word of 
    mouth
PITCH THE BLOGGERS: Another fallacy is that if we just had a big 
    PR and marketing campaign that everyone would know about our 
    product that would be great. That's not true either. Because 
    if you can convince just a few bloggers that it's interesting, 
    and a few early users, that is something really unusual, then it 
    will happen on its own.
Now let me share my Tiny Little Secrets with you; these are some 
    of my stand out moves in the business and personal field. I call 
    them tiny little secrets because they are the very tiny we take for 
    granted and think are not relevant to what we do with a daily 
    business or personal interactive routine. I got a few case studies 
    here. This is my secret, it's really simple. The secret to 
    getting massive press, and I have got massive press for my project, 
    so the first one is the hardest
Be Interesting: Be really damned interesting. Guy Kawasaki in 
    his famous books says: ""If you're not getting 
    press, get better reality"". That's a more clever 
    way of saying what I'm saying, but find something really 
    interesting.
Understand the Internet power: The Internet is another great 
    place to get free advice. SCORE, for example, boasts a mentor 
    network of more than 10,000 mostly retired entrepreneurs 
    nationwide. You can search by related background and meet the 
    mentor locally or by email. You can also get feedback online from 
    12,000 peer entrepreneurs at YoungEntrepreneur.com. And seek 
    out local organizations. At 27, New Yorker Leah Alani founded 
    SophieSays.com, an online boutique for stationery and gifts 
    for special events. She gained the confidence and the practical 
    skills to accelerate the start-up date after taking a four-week 
    class with Ladies Who Launch, which has local chapters in 
    metropolitan areas.
Have a Mentor: most Nigerians 
    and Africans in General don’t understand the power of mentoring. If 
    you desire to be like Aliko Dangote in future, try and take out 
    time to research on his life and secret to his success. I have read 
    over 250 Biographies of 
    great writers and entrepreneurs’. I know what sparked off their 
    idea, their immediate and follow up challenges, how they were 
    discouraged and betrayed and how they found their silver lining to 
    becoming the big giants that they are. Its so simple, all it 
    requires is a book or some little surfing on the internet and you 
    can be in touch with your mentor.
Okay, one final tip: Do everything yourself. And if you're 
    not technical, sorry, you're going to have to be technical. 
    You're going have to learn technology at some level. Otherwise 
    it's not going to happen. You're going have to read a lot 
    of books. You got to learn everything out running a company, but 
    it's going to be a lot of fun. And if it is successful, you 
    get all the percents. You can't lead people if you don't 
    know how to do their job. Food for thoughthun!?
Next week I will take you step by step on some point you should 
    consider before you finally quit your Job and be your own CEO. Be 
    on the look out…

Nwa-Nna,
Was a warm chat with exciting recalls and 
    memiors of the fellowship we 
    shared. God bless you and we keep on our kneels for your 
    wife's health and the success of the '
     touch-down'.

You sound pious and at the same time I read bitter 
    vernoms. You wish me well and at 
    the same time I see concluding phrases to years of relationship. It 
    should not be so. When and how did all these start? I am not a 
    saint neither are you. But we must make certain that the devil is 
    armbushed to devour, to put a 
    knife on the string that holds brethren together. You should be 
    able to tell who  is by now. 
    Wealth, material things are but 
    ephumeral and fleeting. Riches have wimgs. And they can fly. As I said earlier, I trusted you 
    and committed a few things under your care. I 
    dont regret it. I will not. 
    It is not common with me to undo my conviction about someone I am 
    committed to. Yes committed to. When this bond turns to gratifying 
    a selfish interest, there trouble looms. 
    , I was pissed off when you could 
    not consider my dad's plight, when 'it was 
    not convinient for 
    you' to the dismay of my dad. (I have returned 
    that cheque given for the hire of the van because the van was not 
    delivered before the young man travelled East-ward). That should 
    tell you how hard it has been to cope financially with my school, 
    my family, my dad's upkeep, and my 
    sibblings. Second, without recourse to our 
    aggreement to put the van into 
    transport business, the use was diverted without a clear consent. I 
    sent it in your name but it still belonged to me. Assuming my dad 
    was not involved, maybe nobody would have heard us. That old man is 
    my pride, he deserves all the support I can provide. Thirdly, I 
    think you needed to be more open and expressive in your spending. 
    No updates, to mention of or detailing of the list of expenses. I 
    was not told, so I continued to plan on the initial bulk sale price 
    of the land (such plans as 'open account with 
    it', 'give your wife 50,000 
    naira for your car fix', 'pay 
    the clearing agent whatever you have' etc). 
    These are but the cracks. I still believe in times of pressure we 
    should observe to carefully yield to the inner voice of conscience 
    and obey the spirit of grace. I know you have much to chew with 
    putting things together for the family. Even at crossroads, 
    blisters and bitterness should not pervade the path of godliness. I 
    feel the pain as much as you do. But it is not yet over. You 
    dont have to say all the good 
    you have done for me, it is also unwholesome for me to give a 
    laundary list of mine. If we did 
    business together, I did not know the details. All I know is that 
    we traded TRUST, of which my financial stream powered the process. 
    I am willing to give you ALL the profit, if any, from all the 
    deliveries you undertook on my behalf. (I mean what I say without 
    any bitterness). I dare say, hold unto the 250,000 naira you said 
    is left of the 850,000 from the land sale. Charge whatever is 
    outstanding to my account, by the grace of God, I will pay when I 
    visit again. Again, I am not bitter; NO, not me. The 6 months you 
    used the Dodge should be charged to my account, its a goodwill to 
    you. And whatever we did agree that you use from the house you 
    should stay as we discussed.  it is 
    'an off tangent' to let the 
    devil smile at us after more than 30 years. Keep and own the 
    company-  papers. It is yours from 
    henceforth. I sent some books through 
     for your kids as we discussed. 
    Please accept them from him. I apologize for telling brethren the 
    issue that started all these. Again I did that knowing that we are 
    of same household, the inner caucus; Never intended it to be a tale 
    told by certain 'strangers'.
I will wait for the storm to settle, for I intend to find His 
    path and instruction and leadership therein. Do your best not to 
    end it like this. You were hurt, I was hurt; but we can only lead 
    the sheep by showing maturing and 
    examplifying with our lessons and take-homes from this 
    rancour.
God bless you and please kiss your wife for me.
 
    
Bro ,
As per this matter. it remains a 
    cord and a deadly blow to me. I 
    dont know what to say. Presently, I owe the clearing agent 
    500,000 naira for the 2nd container; I owe more than $20,000 on 
    credit due to the shipments; I owe total commitment to the course 
    of the Lord in the church and elsewhere; I owe my family 
    sustainance courtesy of the 
    expected job being applied for. I dont think these calculations 
    will help me. If my brother feels anything with respect to money 
    committed to his care, it is worthwhile to go pay the clearing 
    agent who has my wares under seizure. If he feels bitter for ALL HE 
    HAS DONE FOR ME FOR WHICH I HAVE NOT PAID, let it be and by the 
    grace of God, I will pay for those (if only I can be made to 
    understand what I am owing). I want to thank you for the great 
    concern and prayers. I write in pains; trusting God to help me. 
    Tell  that I 
    dont regret our relationship; 
    that I love him as ever and I appreciate our friendship even in 
    these confusion and dissections. God bless you, brother.
as always,
 
    
Beloved,
Kaanu!
For the meantime, please see the attached for your necessary 
    comments.
We will win the crown, no matter how the enemy schemes.
Udo diri unu,

,
I owe you appologies for 
    this mess. I believe the faith we share is worth more than gold. My 
    heart bleeds with these woes. I never intended it to be so. But I 
    could not but call  
    , 
    and 
    Sis.  
     to let out my burden. I did not 
    call you because it is never to be heard; a detestable development. 
    Trust me, I tried my best to get  to 
    open up and do the right thing. I have been hurt thrice by my 
    beloved  in business circles. This 
    time, my father is involved, credit card money is involved and the 
    issue of accountability and trust is fast eroded. The devil struck 
    a cord the past 6 or 7 months with a worldly possession. What a 
    shame! But it is now a known fact that 
     thinks I owe him a fortune. I 
    dont think so. Or he may be 
    right as my brother in Christ. Whatever it is, I 
    dont have that money I used 
    to have before; so the expectation is misplaced. I just want people 
    to wait until the harvest. I trusted 
     . That is why I gave him my money to hold, gave him the 2 vans I 
    sent (Sienna and Dodge) to sell and maybe I do not have any other 
    fellow to entrust my stuff with. I sold land (with him) and never 
    asked him to show me the physical cash; trusted him to use it to 
    open an account with it.(This he 
    alledges I was unstable in the 
    use) Along the line, money was needed to 
    clear the second container. And he came up with expenses that he 
    had done before. He cant 
    account for 850,000 correctly. Maybe he did not misuse the money. 
    But I have the right to know and ask for what belongs to me. 
    Assuming a certain need took part of that, he could have explained 
    upfront. (Afterall I forgave 
    more than 100,000 naira worth of goods from Cotonou in 1999). The 
    Dodge was for sale. He said it 
    couldnt sell. Upted for transport and I asked if he could 
    manage it. He said yes. I left Nigeria, and he diverted it to his 
    Daycare use without any recourse to our plans. I never knew about 
    this. All these while, my dad had been waiting. Nothing. I called 
    and asked him to please release the van; he wanted to buy it. 
    Offered 500,000 naira. The cost is $4,800 plus 250,000 naira 
    clearing. I refused to sell for his bid. Asked if he can pay the 
    cost instalmentally.  said no. About 
    2 weeks ago,  
     's brother wanted to hire 
    tha van for a week. 
     already paid for this. I asked 
     to release the van. He argues that 
    it is not at his 
    convinience.  judge 
    ' 's 
    convinience and my 
    father's loss.
Now here is the account:
Toyota Sienna sold for (according to 
    ) 1,150,000 naira. Plus 
     land land sold for 850,000 = 
    2,000,000 naira
Clearing cost for Dodge and Sienna= 500,000 naira
Changed to $2,500 = 420,000 naira
's expense in Nigeria = 
    350,000
Disbursed to my Dad = 170,000
 
    purchaesd row seats for Dodge= 35,000
Hotel Accomodation in 
    Lagos =30,000
Total 1,505,000 Bal. 495,000 naira (
     I asked him to give the clearing 
    agent this money)
, this is my very first attempt 
    to calculate this money. I trusted , 
    I gave him a free hand. I never doubted his fidelity. But the 
    problem is that he would not open up to let me know what he wants 
    out of our relationship. I borrowed to buy and send the van, to buy 
    the computers, I have been in school for these 2 and half years. 
    Never earned an income. My wife works to sustain the home. And 
     prizes his business more than my 
    father's daily feeding. Rebuke me where I err. Is it a bad 
    thing to put the van into something that will yield some cash for 
    my dad?
Let me hear from you my brother.
Thanks for your concern.
 
    
, release my Dodge van to Mr.   
    today 5/20/09. You should also provide the 850,00 naira from the 
    sale of my  land. Give it to 
      my 
    causine. Kindly send the 
    computers to my causine as well. 
    My properties in your flat should also be sent there, I will be 
    willing to provide labour and transport for conveyance, please. 
    Just to let you know that I have nothing against you if you can do 
    these. Remember the scriptures: What shall it profit a man, 
    if he gains the whole world and suffers the loss of his soul, or 
    what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Your 
    account is cooked up, we never agreed to use the van 
    van for your private use (you call 
    it 'efficient use') to the 
    detriment of my father in whose name the van was sent. Very 
    unfortunate! Release my van today, turn in the other stuff and the 
    money and we'll be fine. Remember we are all brethren
    ,( I suppose we are).
God bless you.

NigerianEnglish,should,"But Counsel to Yar’Adua, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) objected, saying that Kasumu should file his written address before INEC could respond",deontic,deontic,deontic,Pr_11,"Tribunal gives Iwu 24 hours to reply Atiku
From Kunle Olasanmi, Abuja
In 24 hours, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) 
    Chairman Maurice Iwu must answer some questions on last year’s 
    presidential election, the tribunal said yesterday.
Prof. Iwu is to anwer 
    27 questions raised by Action Congress (AC) candidate Atiku 
    Abubakar, who is challenging the election of President Umaru 
    Yar’Adua.
The Supreme Court last Friday gave Atiku the go-ahead to ask him 
    the questions, which he says are relevant to the determination of 
    his petition .
Some ministers and governors were at the court yesterday to show 
    their support for the President –an action the Action Congress (AC) 
    condemned as a ploy to intimidate the tribunal.
The former Vice President sued Yar’Adua, INEC, the Inspector 
    General of Police and the Chief of Army Staff before the tribunal 
    over the conduct of last year’s presidential election.
He said there were irregularities in the conduct of the April 21 
    election.
Parties at the tribunal were supposed to adopt their written 
    briefs yesterday but that was altered by the judgment of the 
    Supreme Court which ordered Iwu to be interrogated by counsel to 
    Atiku, Prof Alfred Kasumu (SAN).
Atiku formulated 27 questions for the INEC Chairman.
Yesterday, Kasumu told the tribunal chairman, Justice James 
    Ogebe, that there was a Supreme Court judgment last Friday, which 
    ordered that Iwu be interrogated.
He said the INEC chairman was expected to respond to those 
    questions and also file a written address.
Counsel to INEC, Mr. Kanu Agabi (SAN), agreed with 
    Kasumu.
But Counsel to Yar’Adua, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) objected, 
    saying that Kasumu should file his written address before INEC 
    could respond.
Justice Ogebe turned to Olanipekun and said that if INEC had 
    agreed with Kasumu, there was little or nothing he (Olanipekun) 
    could do to change the position because INEC is more concerned in 
    the interrogatories.
Kasumu’s position was agreed upon.
Agabi is expected to file his response to the interrogatories 
    today and his final address tomorrow. Olanipekun is to file his 
    final address on Thursday.
When Kasumu told the court about the judgment of the apex court, 
    Agabi said the Chairman of INEC would have responded to the 
    question immediately he became aware of the judgment but could not 
    because some staff who could assist him with the information 
    concerning the questions had left their offices.
The tribunal wanted to hear the petition filed by General 
    Muhammadu Buhari, the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) presidential 
    candidate in the April, last year election, but his counsel, Chief 
    Mike Ahamba (SAN), objected , 
    saying that he would wait for the interrogatories to be answered 
    before proceeding.
Buhari is also challenging the election of Yar’Adua at the 
    tribunal.
Justice Ogebe was disappointed that parties could not address 
    the tribunal as planned.
""I am disappointed that this matter could not go on today. 
    We have agreed at the last adjourned date that parties would 
    address the court today and a date will be fixed for judgment.
""The whole world is watching what we are doing here and 
    they are also waiting for the outcome,"" Justice Ogebe said.
Yar’Adua’s in-law and the governor of Kebbi State, Seidu 
    Dakingari, was at the tribunal. Also in court was his counterpart 
    in Nasarawa State, Aliyu Akwe Doma,
The minister of Energy, Odenyi Ajumogobia; Prince Adetokunbo 
    Kayode (Tourism); Godwin Abe (Interior); John Odey (Information) 
    and Aja Nwachukwu (Education) were there.
Police chief Mike Okiro, one of the respondents in the petition, 
    was also present. Buhari was there.
Thousands of supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 
    were in court to also show their solidarity to the President.
Scores of anti-riot policemen had a hectic time controlling the 
    crowd at the tribunal.
The court adjourned till February 4 for the final adoption of 
    briefs.
Last Friday, the apex court held: ""Our laws demand that he 
    (Iwu) provide answers to the question and I so hold.
""Court of law cannot sacrifice justice on the altar of 
    speed. A party who demands interrogatory and is denied, is denied 
    fair hearing.""
Atiku brought the interrogatories under Order 33, Rule 1 (1) and 
    Order 3, as well as Order 26, Rule 27 of the Federal High Court 
    Rules and Paragraph 17 (1) and 50 of the 1st schedule to the 
    Electoral Act, 2007.
In the motion paper signed by Kasumu, the request ""to serve 
    interrogatories on Iwu in terms of the questions formulated"" 
    on the order paper were expressed.
Among the questions put forward were issues relating to the 
    award of contracts for the printing of ballot papers to an unnamed 
    South African firm five days to the election even though the 
    company had earlier expressed its inability to deliver such papers 
    on schedule.
The former vice president wants the tribunal to help him 
    ascertain whether or not it was true the company in question had 
    expressed it incapability ""on 
    the ground that delivery deadline was unrealistic if the ballots 
    must carry serial numbers and be in booklet form with 
    counterfoils"".
He also wants Iwu to disclose the ""reasons for the 
    re-award"" of the contract and whether or not the company in 
    question supplied the documents for which it got the contract.
Aside from these questions, Atiku urged the tribunal to allow 
    him interrogate Iwu on whether or not he supplied Anambra, Adamawa, 
    Bauchi, Benue, Cross River, Ebonyi, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Imo, 
    Jigawa, Katsina, Kebbi, Kwara, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, Ogun, Osun 
    and Zamfara states INEC offices with the ballot papers emanating 
    from such a contract for the election.
Similarly, the former vice president wants INEC to answer 
    questions relating to contracts for the construction of voting 
    cubicles for use by voters to thumb-printing during the 
    election.
Specifically, he wanted to know whether the contract for such a 
    project was executed at all and the specific company or companies 
    that won the contracts.
Mr Rickey Tarfa (SAN), who led a team of lawyers to represent 
    Atiku before the tribunal said: ""Answers to these pertinent 
    questions will help us canvass our arguments that the election was 
    flawed.""

NigerianEnglish,should,"That's what you should have said, old man",deontic,deontic,deontic,nov_19,"Threshold of Madness
GOT BOTH OF YOU AT LAST!' shouted the madman. He was 
    frothing in the mouth like a benign cow on its way to the slaughter 
    slab. His massive pair of lips could hardly cover a set of uneven 
    greenish-yellow teeth that could not have been employed for 
    masticating any type of chewing-stick for the last few weeks. His 
    hair and the grains of sand embedded in them had coagulated with 
    the active aid of his sweat, grease, grime and sand into tiny 
    pebbles that made an unsuspecting onlooker to see what looked like 
    a head of unwashed gravel. He had on an embroidered light blue 
    brocade danshiki that had completed the process 
    of transformation into dark brown around the shoulder blades. The 
    armpit area of the unfortunate apparel was already blackened by 
    layers of dead skin from beneath, and grimy fingers, in their 
    unending battle with parasites that inevitably lurk under unwashed 
    and disease riddled skin. His trousers, which did not quite match 
    the top, were torn in several places, barely hiding his male pride. 
    As if to convince the world that he was truly mad, he wore 
    flip-flop on his left foot and a battered trainer on the other one. 
    In his hand, was a large butcher's knife with which he held 
    his victims captive. Both women, who incidentally were sisters, 
    held each other tightly in downright horror almost certain that 
    they had just a few seconds to say their last prayers.
'Begin to run now.' continued the madman. 'You 
    think you have escaped your punishment? Can a chicken escape the 
    claws of a hungry kite?'
'Please calm down my darling,' Adunni managed to say. 
    'My beloved son, descendant of Adigun, the conqueror of seven 
    towns, the brave....'
'Sharrap! Don't mess with me.' 
    responded the madman. 'What has all these nonsense got to do 
    with me? Give me first my breakfast, lunch and dinner money for the 
    past two weeks? Then you can darling me as much as you 
    like.'
'My darling...'
'Don't darling me. Pay up first,' was his 
    guttural response as he launched again at the petrified women. 
    'You turned me into the monster that is standing before you 
    and you shouldn't shy away from meeting the costs.' He 
    seemed to change his mind at the last minute and scratched the road 
    surface with his unwholesome blade, which in turn produced a 
    thousand sparks. Both women quickly opened their handbags and 
    handed over to him all the cash they had between them. The madman 
    could hardly suppress an insane grin. 'God has saved you 
    today.' The relief on his face was palpable, as his knife 
    became lowered and was no longer pointing at the sisters. This was 
    the opening Adunni seized without thinking:
'Oh my darling, Jibowu Akanbi, my son. the one that paid my 
    dowry, please come home with us.' Adunni was about to embrace 
    her son. unmindful of the filth, stench and danger.
""Touch me and you are a dead woman!' barked Jibowu, 
    who suddenly realized that any sign of capitulation on his part 
    might be perceived as a sign of weakness by the demons he had been 
    playing host to for the past few years. He had just enough money to 
    keep him supplied with crack cocaine for a couple of days. The mere 
    thought of what he could achieve, the height of excitement he could 
    attain, the sheer bliss ahead made his spirit to soar. He was blind 
    to the crowd that began to accumulate like dirty flood water at a 
    roadjunction. Adunni had stopped thinking of how to persuade her 
    only son to follow her back home. She had tried many places and 
    spent all she had to find a cure for her son's dangerous 
    addiction.
Native doctors, itinerant alfas and commercial prophets, all 
    agreed with one voice that it was the handiwork of her detractors. 
    'People who are jealous of the youth's rising profile are 
    at the bottom of your son's predicament,' one of them 
    told her. She had spent a fortune on ritual sacrifice and charms to 
    help restore her son to normalcy, but it seemed she hadn't met 
    a good medicine man or a competent alfa yet.
As her mind wandered to the joy her son's condition would 
    bring to the heart of her imaginary enemies, hot tears began to 
    cascade in torrents down her sagging cheeks. Her spirit cursed them 
    and wished them a thousand misfortunes, worse than what had 
    befallen her son. They were not expected to die well... Leprosy and 
    a thousand horrible diseases were her wishes for them. Like a burst 
    dam, she began to rain expletives on her real and imagined enemies, 
    pointing to the trees and punching the air between her and the 
    increasing crowd of spectators.
The person that did this to her would never encounter good 
    luck... People who just arrived at the scene could not reconcile 
    the calmness of a smiling madman with the agitation and tantrum of 
    an expensively dressed woman shouting and screaming at no one in 
    particular, as if she had just swapped minds with the silly looking 
    and dirty young man.
More people continued to arrive like vultures and hawks hoping 
    to catch rodents fleeing from a harmattan conflagration. Jobless 
    men, idle housewives, truant school children, all stopped by for a 
    glimpse of the unusual spectacle.
'Has she gone mad too?' asked Khadijat, a roving bean 
    cake hawker, on tip toe, almost tripping her wares which were 
    skilfully balanced on her head in a glass display box.
'Why doesn't she give him her purse instead of 
    endangering her life?' asked another newcomer to the scene, 
    who thought he was witnessing a case of mugging.
'It looks like a domestic matter between husband and wife 
    o,' said a spectator who was trying to make sense of the scene 
    that has interested so many idle people.
'Ah ha, stupid! Can't you see that 
    the boy is the woman's son?' responded another voice in 
    apparent irritation.
That's what you should have said, old man. You don't 
    have to call me stupid, not with such a wretched mouth.' Some 
    of the people that heard the counter response giggled lightly as 
    they assessed the mouth of the abusive old man. Truly, no one could 
    have described the mouth more scientifically.
'Next time, I will call you an imbecile.'
'Yeah, I will not agree if I were you! This papa is simply 
    wicked,' encouraged more onlookers, obviously experienced in 
    fanning the embers of trouble. This further incensed the younger 
    man who decided to give it back to the old manure fire for 
    fire.
'Old man, respect your scanty grey hair and toothless 
    gum...'
'Oh, this is too much, Papa; the young man has killed you 
    completely! You must not allow him to get away with it,' the 
    trouble-shooters egged on the insulted old man.
'... One of these days, somebody will whack you into good 
    behaviour,' the young man concluded his sentence.
'You see what I mean... Can anyone distinguish between this 
    fool and the madman over there?' Most of the crowd found the 
    old man's remarks quite amusing and they laughed uproariously. 
    The young man, who was not one to allow an insult of that magnitude 
    to pass without an appropriate response, rose to the challenge. 
    Realising that this was going to be a more interesting encounter 
    than the one between the mother and her mad son, the crowd quickly 
    formed a jagged circle around the new adversaries.
'Old man, I've given you enough warning... I can see 
    why you lost so many teeth.'
'You are a useless boy.'
'Poverty stricken old man.'
'Neer-do-well.'
Toothless bulldog.'
'Ugly Rottweiller.'
'You are a beast of no nation.'
'And you, a monkey in the town centre.'
'A bloody nincompoop.'
'Useless vagabond.'
Hot saliva accompanying each expletive flew as far as the nearer 
    spectators who were too absorbed in the prevailing monstrosity to 
    notice or mind. Fingers were pointed and directed like poisonous 
    arrows aimed at burning eyes. White teeth and red gums were exposed 
    like male dogs fighting for supremacy at mating time. The much 
    needed tie break came when the young man called the old man 'a 
    wrinkly old chimpanzee.' The old man was so angry that he 
    pulled down his trousers and pointed his exposed bottom towards the 
    young man. The smoothness of the exposed behind completely belied 
    the deep lines of hardship carved by decades of deprivation and 
    want on the old man's face.
'Can you see any wrinkle?' asked the old man.
'No,' was the unanimous answer from the ecstatic 
    crowd.
'Can you see any craw-craw?' The old man asked another 
    question for greater effect. Most people in the crowd wondered what 
    craw-craw had to do with the encounter.
'No,' was their deafening answer.
'If you see his bum, there is craw-craw there."" This 
    time the old man accompanied his declaration with an obscene 
    cackle.'
Adunni's eyes were dried by the sunny reflection from the 
    old man's incredibly shameless act. It was a comic diversion 
    from the tragedy of her son. If only I could be that modest, 
    thought Adunni in spite of the sorrow that held her captive. She 
    considered briefly, the impossibility of swapping her wobbly behind 
    with the old man's firmness before her eyes settled once again 
    on the foolish grin wandering around her son's lips.
Who would believe that this accident of humanity used to be an 
    undergraduate in one of the world's best universities? No 
    amount of money was spared to provide him with a sound education 
    and to make him comfortable in the foreign country. He spent most 
    of his adolescent in England and came home only on holidays.
Adunni and Kadiri, her husband, promised themselves that their 
    only son would tread triumphant on the grounds they were not 
    privileged to step upon, rub shoulders with the sons of the high 
    and mighty and attain the peak of academic excellence before 
    returning home with honour and pride to the Kadiri family.
While in England, Jibowu spent more time hanging out with 
    transient friends in London's red light districts. He was more 
    determined to be one of the boys than anything else. Pleasing his 
    friends and meeting their expectations of him were uppermost in his 
    priorities. He learnt to match them in potent spirits and smokes. 
    He started with mere cigarettes, then, he learnt to lace it with a 
    little hashish and finally a little crack cocaine now and again. He 
    learnt fast and soon acquired the perverse taste for hard drugs.
On the day his course mates at the South Bank University 
    graduated into independence and self-actualisation, he was still 
    wallowing in the bondage of drugs. He had become enslaved to it and 
    all his allowances and school fees, which his parents struggled to 
    send from far away West Africa, went up in smoke or flowed down the 
    urinary of London public houses.
As he needed extra money to pay for his expensive addiction, his 
    friends introduced him to drug dealing, but the Metropolitan Police 
    were not too pleased with such business.
He was so good at it that he hadn't been in it for more 
    than a few months before they arrested him, charged and secured a 
    conviction against him earning him a deserved place in a British 
    prison.
At last, he was deported back home after completing his term. 
    The Kadiri family had never experienced anything more embarrassing. 
    Mr Kadiri became totally crestfallen and almost died of shame from 
    the consequence of the disrepute brought upon the family name by 
    his son.
After serving his term, the British authorities withdrew 
    Jibowu's residency permit and deported him to his country of 
    origin. Back home in disgrace, his family rallied around him 
    nonetheless and tried to give him as much support as they could 
    muster. They soon discovered after a couple of weeks that the 
    bright boy that had been sent off to England a few years back had 
    grown into an uncontrollable monster who was better left to his own 
    devices. His physical appearance was almost always slovenly, his 
    breath was forbidden and his behaviour was utterly appalling. He 
    quickly overdrew his filial goodwill, completely wiping out all 
    compassion from his relatives. Family members stopped allowing him 
    into their premises as their personal effects frequently developed 
    legs and vanished into the thin air.
Ultimately, cocaine became his sole friend, he trusted it 
    religiously and depended on it absolutely. Together, they descended 
    the steep stairs of mental deraiIment and ventured into the 
    subterranean depth of human degradation and poverty. So fast was 
    his descent that he reached the nadir of human existence in record 
    time. The destitute who slept rough under overhead bridges and car 
    parks in the city centre became his companions. They in turn 
    reciprocated their profound appreciation of his distinguished 
    company by calling him Jibs-Londoner.
The living condition at the car park was such that it was 
    impossible not to be thoroughly filthy. It was convenient 
    nonetheless, as destitute didn't pay rent, electricity bills, 
    taxes or water rates. The society looked down on them as insane and 
    they in turn smelt and acted as such. As a true ambassador of this 
    class of citizens, Jibs-Londoner frequently put on the cloak of 
    madness to generate some of the huge amount of money needed to fund 
    his expensive habit and those of other car park dwellers. His 
    co-travellers encouraged him to explore the vast potential provided 
    by his family and their friends who can be relied upon not to press 
    charges if they were ruffled a little or stripped of a little cash 
    now and again.
'Death is more tolerable than dishonour,' was the wise 
    saying that echoed repeatedly in Adunni's sensibility as she 
    studied her smelly son.

Dear Prof.  
    ,
I commenced procedures yesterday - after waiting about one month 
    to get an intrnational 
    passport - towards getting a German visa for my intended journey to 
     on August 14. The earliest interview 
    date available, and for which I have been scheduled is August 
    12.
With depature date being 
    August 14, and the usual slow pace of such processes back here ( as 
    I ealier 
    hintend in a previous mail to you 
    ), I'm worried that I may not be able to get a visa in time 
    for my journey.
I crave your to help quicken the issuance to me, of the German 
    visa, which is the most relevant requirement for my attendance at 
    the Summer School, which I look forward to. If I could obtain the 
    visa by next week, I'll be glad, and conclude other 
    preparations for my journey in August.
I have forwarded a scanned copy of my appointment letter for 
    interview for the German visa, which contains relevant information, 
    with this mail to you. In case it becomes necessary, my mobile

I'm glad to read from you this morning, as that hasn't 
    happened for sometime now.I must say, 
    it's been hectic trying to register my request for an early 
    visa at the consulate.
However, I'm glad to inform you I've passed through 
    the interview stage yesterday. I made my request, and later spoke 
    with the visa officer,
Mrs , who gave me her phone 
    number to call her on the morning of my departure - 14th August - 
    for confirmation. I'm hoping that with my 
    depature date on my E-ticket, 
    and time table for the workshop, I'll be 
    oblidged with an early visa. 
    If you could do anything to further this, it 
    would be comforting. I don't know how feasible it'll be 
    for you to reach her on phone - .
Another question bothered me as I took a closer look at my 
    E-ticket and movement plans for my journey. Arrival at 
     Airport is for 15th of August, while 
    arrival at the hotel is for 16th August. M

    supposed to check into the hotel?
2. How may I get from  to

    since it's my first time. 
    Will there be someone to meet me?

NigerianEnglish,should,"support of courts’ decisions by every level of government and every government official, like that of private citizens, should be automatic",deontic,deontic,deontic,ed_14,"Ilorin 49, the judiciary, and the academy
Ropo Sekoni commends the Supreme Court judgment on the Ilorin 
    university lecturers
The recent Supreme Court decision on five of the famous Ilorin 
    49 has once again demonstrated that Nigerians at all socioeconomic 
    levels believe in the role of knowledge in the construction of 
    modern society and in the role of the judiciary in stabilizing 
    modern societies. Formal and folk media have been overflowing with 
    expression of congratulations for the judiciary and the 49 workers 
    in the nation’s vineyard of knowledge production. The Supreme Court 
    that has recently been acquiring the status of savior of the 
    country’s democracy on account of a few restoration of the mandate 
    of some governors is also believed by many to have recently added 
    another laurel. The judiciary is also now being seen as the 
    defender of academic freedom and the right of academics to use 
    strike as a legitimate way of expressing grievances to their 
    employers, be they private owners of capital or governments. In 
    addition, the positive reaction of the attorney-general to the 
    judgment is encouraging, even though superfluous. But more 
    superfluous is the statement from the University of Ilorin 
    administration on the judgment.
It is surprising that government officials think they need to 
    assure the nation about their intention to support a court 
    decision, more so a decision of the Supreme Court. In the context 
    of separation of powers that Nigeria finds itself, it is expected 
    that government officials, particularly the attorney-general should 
    have no reason to assure Nigerians that they would support the 
    decision of the nation’s highest court. support of courts’ 
    decisions by every level of government and every government 
    official, like that of private citizens, should be automatic. To 
    say that the government is in support of court decision is to give 
    the impression that it has a choice not to do so. Even if President 
    Yar’Adua had not started his regime by announcing an abiding 
    commitment to the rule of law, it still would have been wrong for 
    the attorney-general or anyone in government to refuse to implement 
    the decision of the court. It is the job of those in the executive 
    and legislative branches of government to accept and implement the 
    verdict of the courts.
While the Minister of Justice’s statement ""If the 
    Supreme Court gives a judgment, that is the position of the law. 
    And this government has never disobeyed the Supreme Court. We will 
    comply with the apex court. . . . I have already left instructions 
    for the Solicitor-General of the Federation to get a copy of the 
    judgment on Monday and write the University of Ilorin immediately 
    to comply with the judgment"" is not an offensive 
    thing to say. However, one wonders if this assurance is necessary 
    in a truly democratic context. The reporter’s question to the 
    attorney-general surely gives him a good opportunity to reaffirm 
    the rule-of-law credentials of his government. Ordinarily, nothing 
    is wrong with giving a politician an opportunity to campaign for 
    his party. But the average reader of newspapers is likely to be 
    confused by the attorney-general’s need to urge the University of 
    Ilorin to comply with the judgment. Does the institution have a 
    choice over the matter in a democracy?
When the executive branch failed to accept the decision of the 
    judiciary during the regime of General Obasanjo, Nigerians drew 
    attention to the irregularity of such behavior in a democracy. For 
    example, When General Obasanjo refused to carry out the directives 
    of the court on payment of the funds due to local governments in 
    Lagos State, Nigerians complained bitterly and called Obasanjo a 
    dictator and an enemy of democracy. Even Obasanjo’s 
    attorney-general who appeared to share Obasanjo’s view of the 
    superiority of the executive to the judicial branch got some flaks 
    from his fellow members of the bar, as well as from the citizenry. 
    In other words, it is not a sign of political strength for anybody 
    in the executive to give the impression that he or she is doing 
    anything special by his or her acceptance of judicial 
    interpretations and decisions. It is, constitutionally, the job of 
    the judiciary to interpret the law of the land and the duty of the 
    executive and all agencies of government to accept such 
    interpretations.
More worrisome is the reaction from the University of Ilorin. 
    According to media reports, one of the institution’s deputy vice 
    chancellors seized the opportunity of reacting to the judgment of 
    the Supreme Court to rehash the story of the problem that led to 
    the case itself. Let us hear from the deputy vice chancellor in 
    charge of management services: ""As an institution, we 
    believe in the rule of law. The Supreme Court has delivered its 
    judgment. We believe in the rule of law and we will obey, . . . 
    Judgment is one thing but the truth of the matter is cause and 
    effect in nature. People who have forgotten what caused the problem 
    are now making pontifications about the case in the 
    media.""
Agonism or conflict that is the driving force for tragic drama 
    is finding its way to news writing. Otherwise, there would have 
    been no reason for the deputy vice chancellor to re-open the case, 
    accuse the media of bias against the institution, and blame 
    citizens for pontificating. The question that would have helped the 
    University of Ilorin to look ahead on this matter is to find out 
    what difficulties the institution envisages in implementing 
    re-instatement of the five lecturers and payment of salary arrears 
    for nine years, not whether the university will accept the 
    judgment. The University does not appear to have any choice in the 
    matter. It is expected to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision 
    and should not have needed any prodding from the Minister of 
    Justice.
The point of this writer’s complaint is about the danger of 
    information overload for young children being socialized into 
    modern society. In the way questions are posed by the media or are 
    answered by public servants, we may unintentionally be sending 
    wrong signals to children being socialized into the culture of 
    democracy. To ask the attorney-general and the deputy vice 
    chancellor their position on the verdict of the Supreme Court is to 
    use impunity as the cultural default. We need to use the rule of 
    law as the default in post- military and post-Obasanjo Nigeria.
The academy also appears to be under the undue influence of the 
    agonistic aspect of Nigerian politics. If it was not, there would 
    have been no Ilorin 49 in the first instance, but the post-Obasanjo 
    era should call for a new sensibility on the part of all agents of 
    socialization: the media, government ministers, and institutional 
    leaders. In the academy, the dominant culture does not encourage 
    analysis after conclusion and recommendation. The Supreme Court’s 
    verdict constitutes conclusion and recommendation on the issue of 
    five out of the Unilorin 49. There should be no attempt to re-open 
    the case or start analysis after the delivery of concluding 
    statements on this matter.
A judgment is a settlement of conflict. What is needed now is, 
    while waiting for similar verdict on Ilorin 44, how to make sure 
    that the University of Ilorin is financially and psychologically 
    pre-disposed to carry out the orders of the Supreme Court, not to 
    re-open old wounds.

    years old, 87% married while 66% were literate. About 86% were 
    full-time small-scale rice farmers (69% growing less than 2.6ha) while only 48.8% of these had fortnightly contact 
    with agricultural extension agents. Most of the farmers (72.4%) were land secure while about half relied solely on hired 
    labour. The knowledge level of agrochemicals and their level of use 
    were found to be moderately high. About 41% of them depended on 
    extension agents as major source of information about rice 
    agro-chemicals. Other major sources were salesmen of agrochemicals,

    knowledge of safety devices and methods used in the application of 
    rice agrochemicals. The literacy level of farmers need to be raised 
    while extension agents need to intensify their visit and campaign 
    on the use of rice agrochemicals, particularly the safety devices 
    and methods attached to the application of the chemicals.
INTRODUCTION
Rice is one of the oldest foods known to man, and it is taken as 
    part of the three daily meals in certain areas of the world [1]. 
    About three decades ago, except in areas where rice was grown as 
    traditional crop, many households took rice only on Sundays or 
    during important festivities. Today, all households have 
    incorporated rice into their regular menu, some taking it on daily 
    basis. Rice has therefore shifted from being a 
    ""ceremonial"" or ""weekend"" food in Nigeria to 
    part of the normal diet [2].
Since the early development of agricultural practices, people 
    have always sought different ways to increase their crop yield. 
    Notable are the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, 
    insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, thuricides (for soil worms) 
    and improved cultivars. The early use of pesticides included a 
    variety of substances such as urine, lime-soap suds, vinegar, 
    tobacco, and similar simple compounds [3].
Agrochemicals are used extensively in modern farming, hence it 
    is almost impossible to avoid daily exposure to low levels of 
    different ones. There is now a great concern about the possible 
    adverse effects on human health arising from continuous long term 
    exposure [4]. According to Sarnar [5], agricultural workers run at 
    least twice the risk of dying on the job than workers in other 
    sectors. In a global overview prepared for a recent conference on 
    farm safety and health, International Labor Organization (ILO) 
    reported that tens of thousands of agricultural workers die each 
    year, and millions suffer injuries or poisoning from agrochemicals. 
    Most of the time, exposure to agrochemicals also constitute another 
    risk of farm workers accounting in some countries for as much as 
    14% of all occupational injuries in the agricultural sector and 10% 
    of all fatalities.
Rice farmers are exposed to agrochemicals when chemicals are 
    used during rice cultivation as insecticides, herbicides and 
    fungicides. After harvesting, during storage, most cereals are 
    doused again with several chemicals to protect them from pests and 
    diseases. It has been estimated that cereal crops receive 
    approximately 5-8 pesticide applications per growing season [3].
The general public is becoming increasingly aware about 
    agrochemical use. This is because the effects of such use are not 
    always confined to the area of land treated. Nitrates and 
    fertilizers may seep into sources of drinking water, and pesticides 
    may contaminate river water or be carried as spray drift onto 
    public land. Unfortunately, the public is more aware about the 
    benefits of agrochemical application than about the harm that 
    misuse can cause [6]. The pertinent question to ask now is that 
    ""are rice farmers aware of the high risk due to inadequate 
    education, training and safety devices in adoption of 
    agrochemicals?"" [5].
To minimize the hazards caused by wrong use or poor handling of 
    agrochemicals, Udoh [7] advocates that banned chemicals not be 
    imported, recommended ones be available all year round at 
    affordable prices, while consistent educational campaign should be 
    directed at the rice farmers. The problem of poor handling and 
    wrong use of agrochemicals is still rampant among rice farmers, 
    making them victims of frequently occurring chemical accidents. 
    Much of the educational campaign effort to mitigate this problem 
    still lies with the field extension agents. To this extent, this 
    study was designed to investigate the use of safety devices adopted 
    in the use of agrochemicals by rice farmers in Obafemi-Owode Local 
    Government Area of Ogun State. The specific objectives of the study 
    are to: (1) identify the socio-economic characteristics of the 
    respondents, (2) identify the commonly used agrochemicals in rice 
    production in the study area. (3) find out the respondents' 
    knowledge of safety devices employed in the application of 
    agrochemicals and (4) determine the extent of use of such safety 
    devices by the respondents.
The hypotheses of the study, stated in the null form, are: (I) 
    There is no significant relationship between selected personal 
    characteristics (age, cosmopolitanism, level of education, primary 
    occupation, farm size, labour, extension contact) of the 
    respondents and adoption of rice agrochemicals. (II) There is no 
    significant relationship between selected personal characteristics 
    (age, cosmopolitanism, level of education, primary occupation, farm 
    size, labour, extension contact) of the respondents and their 
    knowledge of safety measures used in the application of rice 
    agrochemicals.
METHODOLOGY
This study was carried out among the rice farmers in 
    Obafemi-Owode LGA of Ogun State, Nigeria. The list of registered 
    rice farmers in the local government area obtained from the 
    Agricultural Development Programme Zonal office at Ikenne indicated 
    that 426 of them were still functioning. They were registered on 
    'cell' basis and there were 7 
    cells. 'Cells' are 
    geographical units of a local government area delineated for easy 
    administration by village extension agents (VEAs). One hundred and 
    thirty, representing one-third of the registered farmers, were 
    randomly selected, pro-rata per cell. These 130 constituted the 
    sample respondents on which validated and structured interview 
    schedule was administered to procure data. One hundred and twenty 
    seven interview schedules were found well administered and 
    therefore, processed. The data were then subjected to descriptive 
    and inferential analyses.
RESULTS
Sex: Data collected indicated that 93.7% of the respondents were male while 6.3% were female.
Age, Marital status, Level of education : 
    Data in Table 1a indicates that almost two-thirds (63.4%) of 
    the respondents were not more than 50 years old while only 12.2% were above 60 years. About 87% were married while only 5% were 
    single. About 66% of the farmers were literate out of which a 
    majority of 38.6% attended only primary school. However, 4% 
    acquired post secondary education.
Primary and Secondary occupations - Table 
    1a further indicates that about 86% of the respondents were engaged 
    in farming as their primary occupation while 21.3% adopted 
    it as secondary occupation. From the data on secondary occupation 
    most of the farmers were engaged in other non-farm income 
    generating activities such as Trading - 15%, Artisans - 14.2%, Civil service - 11.2%. Only 21.3% of the 
    respondents had no secondary occupation.
Membership of formal social groups - 
    Majority (63%) of the respondents were members of cooperative 
    societies while 37% did not belong to any formal organization 
    (Table 1b). About 41% and 21.3% belonged to religious and 
    socio-cultural groups, respectively, while 17% were members of 
    trade/professional associations.
Cosmopolitanism: This is the exposure to 
    more developed areas beyond the respondent's abode. It is 
    measured by the frequency of visits to major towns and/or cities by 
    the respondents. About 45% (weekly - 26%, fortnightly - 18.9%) had a high level of cosmopolitanism, while 35.4% 
    rarely traveled out of their farming communities.
Extension contact: Data in Table 1b 
    revealed that only 48.8% had fortnightly contact with 
    extension services while 27.6% did not enjoy extension 
    services at all.
Farm size, Land ownership, Labour source - 
    Table 1b indicates that majority (68.5%) of the farmers were 
    small-scale rice producers because 68.9% were growing less 
    than 2.6 hectares. Only 31.5% had farms larger than 
    2.6 hectares. About 72.4% were land secure - 66.9% were operating on inherited land while 5.5% purchased 
    theirs. Only 17.3% of the respondents depended solely on 
    family labour while 49.6% relied solely on hired labour. 
    About 25% augmented hired labour with family labour.
Knowledge and Use of Agrochemicals
Data in Table 2 contains data about knowledge and use of rice 
    agrochemicals. About 54% had the knowledge of herbicides but only 
    41.4 actually used them. For seed dressing chemicals, 
    51.2% knew about them but only 30% used them while 78.7% knew pesticides but only 50.4% used them. About 7.1% did not have the knowledge of agrochemicals at all while 
    12.6% were not using them at all.
Main source of knowledge about agrochemicals
Table 3 contains data that reveal the major sources of 
    information which the farmers patronized about rice agrochemicals. 
    Most of them (40.9%) relied on agricultural extension agents 
    while 10% depended on salesmen of agrochemicals. Rice merchants who 
    sometimes pay in advance for the farmers' products were the 
    sources of knowledge about the chemicals to 16.5% while 
    24.4% depended on Radio and Television. However, those who 
    depended solely on radio and television may only be aware and not 
    convinced enough to adopt the chemicals.
Knowledge and Use of safety devices
Data in Tables 4 and 5 show the percentage of farmers that had 
    the knowledge of safety devices used during application of 
    agrochemicals and the percentage of those that were actually using 
    the devices. Forty percent of the farmers knew that they should use 
    overalls when applying herbicides but only 11.8% were 
    actually using them. About 12.6% of the farmers knew they 
    should bathe after applying pesticides but only 7.1% were 
    actually doing so. About 47.1% of the farmers knew about the 
    use of nose guards when dressing seeds with chemicals but only 
    10.2% were actually using it.
Result of hypotheses
Chi square analyses revealed that none of the selected 
    socio-economic characteristics was significantly related to 
    adoption of rice agrochemicals. However, age 
    (χ2 = .266, p=.018) and 
    educational level (χ2 = 72.003, 
    p=0.051) were significantly related to knowledge of safety 
    devices used in the application of rice agrochemicals.
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
Sex, Age, Marital status - Rice cultivation 
    is known to be time and energy sapping [6]. Except where reliable 
    labour is available, women could hardly combine their other 
    non-farm activities with rice cultivation, hence the few women 
    recorded. The large proportion (63.4%) of respondents found 
    to be less than 50 years old indicates that majority could still be 
    actively and productively engaged in farming. The resource-scarce 
    farming still being practised in this area requires a substantial 
    input of family labour, hence majority of the farmers were 
    married.
Level of education - Findings here are 
    consistent with [1] who reported in his study of rice farmers in 
    Ogun State that 40.4% of the respondents had no formal 
    education. In Nigerian extension studies, innovativeness has been 
    found to be positively related to high levels of education [8]. The 
    relatively high level of education found among the respondents 
    would help them in adopting chemicals and safety measures.
Occupation - Engagement in non-farm 
    occupations by many of the farmers is a poverty alleviation 
    strategy. Income realized from these is used to augment the farm 
    earnings in order to meet the numerous financial demands of the 
    households.
Membership of formal organizations - 
    Sixty-three percent of the respondents belonged to cooperative 
    societies which happened to be veritable sources of loans to 
    members. Some cooperative organizations even procure material 
    inputs for members and help them market their produce. About 17% 
    were members of trade/professional groups. Such groups protect the 
    interest of members and often formulate marketing strategies for 
    members.
Cosmopolitanism - High level of 
    cosmopolitanism may sometimes affect farming activities adversely 
    [9] while sometimes it enhances innovativeness because of exchange 
    of ideas with more enlightened colleagues met in the course of 
    traveling [10].
Extension contact - Because most of the 
    farmers were operating under the auspices of Agricultural 
    Development Programme (ADP) village extension agents were supposed 
    to contact them fortnightly. It is however surprising that only 
    48.8% enjoyed this fortnightly contact, contrary to 
    expectation. Extension agents were not even visiting about 27.6% of the farmers and they too were not visiting the extension 
    agents. This would definitely affect adoption of innovations 
    adversely.

    LARUTIm
As the Lagos State Government commences the pilot scheme of its 
    tri-cycle initiative tagged Lagos State Rural Transportation 
    initiative (LARUTI), residents have expressed optimism that the 
    development would not only create employment opportunities, but 
    also address the challenges encountered by rural dwellers in the 
    transportation of goods and services to the urban centres, 
    MIRIAM NDIKANWU reports.
The Lagos State government on Tuesday, flagged off the LASRUTI 
    scheme with the distribution of 82 tri-cycles to beneficiaries.
At the commencement of the first phase, at the State Vehicle 
    Inspectorate Officer (VIO) training school Ikorodu, the state 
    Commissioner for Rural Development, Prince Lanre Balogun , said 
    that the first batch would be use to test run the scheme.
He announced Governor Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola SAN, 
    would commission the scheme later in the year after government have 
    certified the efficiency of the scheme, through feedbacks from 
    operators. He tadded that 
    government is sowing a mustard seed through beneficiaries whom he 
    said, are expected to the new tri-cycles for further growth that 
    would improve lives as well as the nation’s economy.
""This idea to find solution to the challenges of 
    transportation for rural people was conceived so many years ago, to 
    alleviate poverty in the rural area for people who lack proper 
    transportation means.""
Speaking on the criteria for participation, Balogun explained 
    that on whatever platform an interested investors want to 
    participate, he or she would make an initial deposit of N100,000, 
    plus a weekly installation ranging from N14,000 and N12,000.
The programme, he added, was designed to enable beneficiaries 
    pay back and become entrepreneurs within the shortest possible 
    period.
Explaining the duration for payment, he said the programme does 
    not have a terminal date, it is dynamic and continuous for all 
    season'
He said government have also put in place a team of engineers 
    that the beneficiaries can always called on when the need 
    arises.
He however, warned that riders should not patronise road side 
    mechanics whenever the tri-cycles break down, disclosing that 
    arrangements have been made for spare parts and service 
    personnel.
Some of the beneficiaries who spoke with the nation at the event 
    described the scheme as a laudable project.
He said that the tri-cycles which are in batches of three cost 
    N623000, N340000 while the third type is still been awaited.
He further added that the tri-cycle is meant for everybody 
    including civil servants who are living in rural areas of the state 
    as long as they are ready to keep to the necessary procedure on the 
    acquisition of the tri-cycle.
""The manner of acquisition is based on first come first 
    serve and not on selective process"" he added.
Mrs. Kehinde George, a female trader from the Lagos 
    Island, who said she would drive the tri-cycle herself commended 
    the government. In her words: ""This would create employment 
    opportunity for those of us that do not have job as well as assist 
    us in raising funds for the home front.""
A middle-aged man named Kola. from Alimosho/ 
    Igando- Ikotun LCDA, was visibly 
    excited about the project. He commended the state government for 
    the laudable initiative.
""I feel very happy and I think that our Governor has shown 
    that he has the plight of Lagosians at heart. If I should take this 
    home today, even the people at home too will feel the impact and 
    they would be very happy,"" Kola told The 
    Nation.
""I am optimistic that people would patronize the 
    tri-cycles because it is better than Keke Marwa or Keke Napep. 
    There are different models and the sitting arrangement is well 
    structured than the Keke Marwa.""
Akinsanya stated that the break down of the fund 
    include 8,000 for registration, 15,000 for insurance, while the 
    N600000 is the initial price without interest from the state 
    government.

    Part (11)
“Optic Fiber Vs Wireless” Chris Uwaje _ with contribution from 
    Roland Alden.“ However, in the developing economies where network 
    construction is viewed in context as an investment in the economy 
    and driver of economic growth, this view is 180′ out of synch.
Network construction in these environments should be optimized 
    to enable the maximum amount of opportunity along and adjacent the 
    network route. For example, in the “cost” view model of network 
    construction the need for reliable electricity at a regeneration 
    point is viewed as a negative input that must be compensated for by 
    either 1) costly construction or by 2) fancy electronics that allow 
    the “powerless” region to be traversed without stopping.
In the “development model” the need to provide an oasis of 
    electricity and infrastructure along the network route is also an 
    opportunity to enable an economic environment that will create 
    network customers over the long term. Furthermore, this investment 
    in a “micro economy” lowers the cost of providing service to 
    possibly larger economies elsewhere on the network.
This view of network construction is not common in telecom but 
    is the norm for other networks, such as roads and waterworks.
In many large countries it is not at all uncommon to travel on a 
    long, nearly deserted highway only to find gas stations at 
    amazingly regular intervals which provide the fuel that makes the 
    highway into an economically useful resource. No one builds special 
    purpose vehicles equipped with gigantic fuel tanks that make such 
    gas stations unnecessary.
Typically a small economy may grow up around such a gas station; 
    at a minimum one large enough to sustain the gas station itself but 
    typically one which might further leverage the investment such as 
    mechanized farms, irrigation pumps, a small airport and perhaps a 
    regional healthcare facility. The value of the gas station to the 
    adjacent economies that it nourishes can easily be doubled simply 
    by locating it at the intersection of two highways instead of 
    alongside only one.
Using this example it is easy to see that the “topology” of 
    human trade routes and living patterns guides so much 
    “infrastructure” development. Telecom development follows these 
    patterns to the degree that they must but there are two 
    externalities that have significantly distorted the evolution of 
    telecom. First, there is regulation.
The development of cities, settled areas, roads and trade routes 
    were largely subject to the kind of narrowly focused grants of 
    monopoly seen in telecom. Secondly, the use of technology to 
    attempt to “by pass” small and 
    large blocks of humanity in order to communicate across, over, 
    around and through them is somewhat unique to telecom.
The combination of wireless technology and Africa is often 
    painted as a logically synergistic combination. Large areas that 
    have historically been poorly served by dysfunction monopoly PTTs, 
    poverty that argues for a cheap and “quick fix” solution.
I often hear arguments to the effect that “since Africa is 
    different” …a different approach logically follows. As long as the 
    first postulate goes unchallenged the second assertion gets an 
    intellectual free ride that it does not deserve.
In making the case for fiber in Africa I’d like to argue that 
    Africa is *not* different and that the Africa we see today proves 
    that, if we’d only see it with open eyes.
It would be a tragedy to not apply lessons from other parts of 
    the world which could be used to make Africa 
    telecom_rich simply because 
    of a mistaken notion that somehow Africa is “different” and has to 
    underwrite a costly discovery of its own rules.“

NigerianEnglish,should,"Public, politicians and senior government officials should be taught that the purpose of government is to “serve civil society, not exploit it”",deontic,deontic,deontic,PSsc_07,"Corruption Management – An Alternative Proactive 
    Approach
Over the past few years, corruption has become a topic of 
    increased interest and debate within Nigerian society. Nigeria’s 
    independent media and other commentators worldwide are constantly 
    assessing the government's efforts to address corruption. This 
    public discourse is a critical element in any anticorruption effort 
    and is essential in raising public awareness of the issues 
    associated with corruption in Nigeria.
In a democratic society, the public's tolerance, or more 
    significantly, intolerance, of corrupt practices determines the 
    success of any anticorruption campaign. In established democracies, 
    elected officials react to the public's intolerance of 
    corruption by initiating investigations and/or enacting legislation 
    that results in reform. Consequently, we hope, the continued public 
    debate and publicity occurring within Nigeria on corruption will 
    result in the public becoming less tolerant of corrupt 
    practices.
The history of corruption is as old as the world, because 
    ancient civilizations have traces of widespread ‘illegality and corruption.’ (Dike, 2003). Thus, 
    Lipset and Lenz, 2000 noted that ""corruption has been 
    ubiquitous in complex societies from ancient Egypt, Israel, Rome, 
    and Greece down to the present."" Corruption is also 
    believed to be endemic in modern governments and it is not peculiar 
    to any continent, region, or ethnic group. This does not, however, 
    mean that the incidence and magnitude of corrupt activities are the 
    same in every society. Some countries are obviously more corrupt; 
    yet others have better plans in managing corrupt activities. 
    Obviously, Nigeria is not one of those countries with a better 
    handle on corruption, despite its unending corruption commissions 
    and all the noise made by every administration on the efforts to 
    transform the nation into a corruption-free society (Dike, 
    2003).
Therefore this article is written with a view to adopt a new 
    approach - managing the challenges posed by corruption in the 
    Nigerian society, rather than acting to punish incidents. This is a 
    sort of proactive prevention in the first place, containing it to a 
    manageable level. Corruption in Nigerian society has eaten deep 
    into the fabric, and is perpetrated not only by those who govern, 
    but also by the governed. Management should therefore be a 
    combination of sincere prevention measures and tough remedial 
    measures. These should be unconditional. (Zero-tolerance comes to 
    mind here).
Corruption is a complex and adaptive phenomenon that affects 
    many aspects of society and has plagued societies from the 
    beginning of time. It is difficult to define, understand, and 
    control. Because of the complexities associated with corruption and 
    the differing perceptions individuals have of the phenomenon; it is 
    not easy to define a realistic anticorruption goal.
* Is it realistic to strive for the total elimination of 
    corruption in any society?
* Can a corruption-free society actually exist?
Although a number of societies may have reduced corruption to 
    relatively low levels, none has created a utopian society where 
    corruption does not exist.
Today, corruption in its various forms and manifestations is 
    prevalent in all societies, even the most advanced Western 
    democracies. Transparency International's Annual Corruption 
    Perception Index does not reveal any country receiving a 
    ""perfect 10"" or ""zero corruption"" in the annual 
    country corruption environment rankings.
* Rather than creating unrealistic public expectations 
    suggesting that corruption can be eliminated, would it not be 
    preferable to educate the public to the reality that corruption 
    cannot be eliminated but can be effectively managed?
* Can realistic goals and milestones be established within 
    various components of society, specifically government 
    bureaucracies, to effectively manage corruption?
* Perhaps either knowingly or unknowing, this is what is 
    occurring in many modern societies in which corruption is a 
    relatively minor social problem. If so, can an effective corruption 
    management strategy be developed and implemented in Nigeria?
* What should be the focus of an effective corruption management 
    strategy?
As a Food Hygiene and Safety trainer, I always enjoy teaching 
    Pest Control to my students, and hence came up with what I call the 
    “Vermin Allegory” or figure of speech. The vermin allegory can 
    provide some guidance in developing an effective anti-corruption 
    strategy. When mice, rodents or other vermin infest a building, 
    there are two distinct strategy options available to combat the 
    infestation.
One is a ""detection strategy"" that attempts to catch 
    the vermin, most likely one at time. The other is a strategy that 
    cleans up the environment to make it unattractive to vermin. In 
    fact, the most effective vermin control strategy includes both 
    prevention and detection components. Pests like vermin, need 
    several favourable or conducive conditions before they can infest a 
    building: they need warmth; they need food; they need a dirty 
    environment; they also need some form of encouragement from the 
    building’s owner. Take all these favourable conditions away from 
    them, and they will not be able to infest the building, or if they 
    do, they will not multiply.
The vermin allegory can be used to develop and educate the 
    public about a national corruption management strategy. Its 
    application could result in the government establishing realistic 
    goals and milestones, and, most importantly, specific strategies to 
    address corruption throughout all the arms of government, the 
    public sector and the public in Nigeria. Although applicable to a 
    national corruption strategy, the methods described by the vermin 
    allegory might be better applied to address corruption within 
    individual Nigeria government bureaucracies. It would mark a new 
    direction if Nigerian government bureaucracies openly conveyed 
    their own anticorruption, or integrity strategy, to their employees 
    and the public. Perhaps this should be one of the initial 
    milestones of the Nigerian government's overall anticorruption 
    strategy.
As in the vermin allegory, any anticorruption strategy should 
    encompass both detection and prevention components. Since they are 
    more tangible, detection components of an anticorruption strategy 
    are easier to develop and implement. Investigations, prosecutions, 
    convictions, and sanctions for corruption-related offenses as well 
    as a mechanism for the public to report incidence of alleged 
    corruption are the most common anticorruption strategy detection 
    components.
Although the uniform application and effectiveness of these 
    components might be subject to debate, Nigeria has already 
    implemented a number of anticorruption detection components. The 
    high profile corruption investigations and public reporting 
    mechanism initiated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission 
    (EFCC) called the Anti Corruption Revolution (ANCOR) project, as 
    well as the conviction and sentencing of a number of high-profile 
    officials highlight anticorruption detection on a national 
    level.
Due to an absence of communication and the lack of transparency 
    at both political and bureaucratic levels, it is difficult to 
    assess what, if anything, various Nigerian arms of government and 
    organizations are doing to detect corruption. Similar to what 
    should occur on a national level, bureaucracies should establish 
    mechanisms for employees and the public to report alleged 
    corruption. This reporting mechanism should be structured so that 
    nothing can be hidden and be supported by an independent 
    investigation that would determine if the allegations can be 
    substantiated. The government organization's management should 
    also lead in a way that encourages managers and supervisors to 
    detect and report illicit activities.
In contrast, corruption prevention actions are far less tangible 
    and far more difficult to implement and assess. However, as 
    reflected by the vermin allegory, the proactive prevention 
    components of corruption management strategy are significantly more 
    important than those focused on detection. Realistically, it is 
    certainly more cost effective to expend resources to prevent 
    corruption than to incur the financial, social and political costs 
    associated with corruption. Additionally, once corruption has 
    permeated an environment or society such as ours, there can be no 
    assurance that any type of detection efforts will be successful in 
    eradicating it. Unfortunately, in most anticorruption campaigns or 
    efforts, detection is usually overemphasized at the cost of 
    prevention.
When addressing the issue of corruption, politicians and senior 
    government bureaucrats tend to emphasize reactive detection 
    methods. At the national level, detection activities are important 
    in demonstrating political will and gaining public confidence in 
    the government's anticorruption efforts. Detection activities 
    are also critical at the bureaucratic level in demonstrating 
    management's intolerance for corruption. However, detection 
    methods alone will never be sufficient to effectively manage 
    corruption.
On a national level, a corruption prevention strategy should 
    focus on enhancing the public's awareness of the social, 
    economic and political costs associated with corruption. Public, 
    politicians and senior government officials should be taught that 
    the purpose of government is to “serve civil society, not exploit 
    it”. These educational efforts should diminish the public's 
    tolerance of many corrupt practices that are currently viewed as 
    acceptable. Additional, national public education efforts may cause 
    the various agencies within government to be more concerned about 
    their public image. Government educational efforts, possibly in 
    partnership with social organizations, should also focus on 
    educating the younger generation on the evils of corruption as well 
    as acceptable and non-acceptable standards of public behaviour.
To prevent corruption, bureaucracies/civil service should do 
    everything possible to recruit individuals of high moral character 
    and do everything possible to ensure that the honest employees that 
    are hired remain honest throughout their careers, and this could be 
    achieved by commensurate reward. The same conditions should be 
    applied to political candidates for all elective positions. Since 
    prior conduct is the best predictor of future behaviour, a 
    comprehensive background investigation process would help ensure 
    that new employees or potential political candidates are of good 
    moral character. Establishing and enforcing agency codes of conduct 
    and instituting integrity-related training programs, including 
    enhancing critical thinking and situational planning, are also 
    necessary to prevent corruption.
In addition, government systems and processes should be 
    modernized and streamlined to minimize rent seeking opportunities. 
    Although the fear of punishment is seldom sufficient to deter 
    habitual bad behaviour, the various governments should establish 
    and consistently apply penalties that reflect the consequences of 
    violating the agency's code of conduct.
Supervisors and managers within the bureaucracy should also be 
    held responsible and accountable for any misconduct by their 
    employees. There is no reason, for example, why all the states and 
    local governments in the country should not have their own 
    independent anti-corruption agencies which will work very closely 
    with the national agencies like the EFCC, ICPC and the Code of 
    Conduct Tribunals.
In all sincerity, Nigeria, since the new democratic dispensation 
    began in 1999, has made noticeable progress in its ongoing 
    anticorruption campaign, although many Nigerians believe the 
    anti-corruption campaign under President Yar ‘Adua has floundered, 
    what with the on-going political somersaulting, double-speaks, 
    subterfuges and face-volte in the country, it does not look like 
    the Yar ‘Adua administration would be anything different than that 
    of Obasanjo or even previous military governments. In fact, it 
    seems to be getting worse, and this seems to be buttressed by the 
    fact that many indicted, accused former Governors, Ministers and 
    party officials are still walking around free today, their loot 
    intact, and several of them are alleged to be the real power behind 
    this Administration of the so-called “servant-leader.” Some of them 
    have even found their way back into the government openly and 
    against public opinion. Several of them, including serving 
    Governors are known to be controlling the Federal ministries by 
    installing their appointees in choice ministerial or civil service 
    positions.
At the same time, let us realise and accept that we are all 
    complicit in this corruption issue. It is not only the leaders, but 
    also the “led”. We, the “led”, are as complicit, because we allow 
    the leaders to be corrupt in so many ways. We are as complicit 
    because we tend to turn a blind eye such that the leaders now take 
    it for granted to be corrupt, and we also expect them to be too. We 
    even sing their praises, adore them, and confer dubious honours on 
    them in the traditional society, the churches, the mosques, at 
    parades, at parties, events, seminars, conferences, offices, etc. 
    No, our leaders are not the only corrupt ones; after all they are a 
    product of the society that spawns them. The larger Nigerian 
    society cannot absolve itself of this blame.
The government should consider how best to maintain and refine 
    the country's corruption detection activities while also 
    developing and implementing corruption prevention strategies 
    essential to effectively managing corruption throughout Nigeria. 
    This is the only alternative. If the government keeps on saying it 
    wants to eradicate corruption in Nigerian society, it is not being 
    sincere with us. Corruption can never be eradicated in any society, 
    it can only be managed, and managed effectively and efficiently to 
    derive any success.
The key word here is “management”. It is how the government 
    manages corruption that will determine its effectiveness. In this 
    century, emphasis is being placed on management – change, 
    financial, people, information, self, stress, time, absence, 
    capacity, etc – and this is how we should view corruption: 
    Corruption Management.
Unruh, 2008 concluded that taking a corruption management 
    approach requires fusing the insights of corporate ethics with the 
    tactics used to fight systemic corruption. When successful, it 
    creates something simple and elegant: integrity. I will add that, 
    in the case of governance of a country, it also creates 
    development, justice, peace and progress. And these are all we need 
    and ask for from our various governments.

For two tortuous years, Timothy Oni combed the nooks and 
    crannies of Lagos metropolis for accommodation to no avail. If it 
    was about money, it was not a problem as he had loads of it to pay 
    even shylock landlords. Yet, accommodation remained elusive even 
    after he commissioned agents. ‘’I moved from one agent to the 
    other, doing everything possible to get a place to keep my head,’’ 
    he recalled. Oni was a qualified tenant except that many landlords 
    considered him a risk. ""They would not give me accommodation 
    because I am blind,’’ he lamented, battling hard to keep tears from 
    flowing. After two frustrating years of searching for something his 
    able-bodied counterparts will get in less than a month, he finally 
    secured one last month in a suburb of Lagos. By then, he was so 
    drained that he could not even celebrate what he described as 
    ""a big miracle"".
Dare Dairo, a qualified TV producer once attended applied for a 
    job in a broadcasting station. Like all applicants, he went through 
    the long process of recruitment and was always emerging top. At the 
    interview panel leading to his final engagement, he shone like a 
    galaxy of stars, winning the respect of the interviewers. Just when 
    he was almost sure of resuming, the executive producer called him 
    aside and told him that the job was not meant for people like him. 
    ""He said I should find somewhere else to work because of my 
    physical disability,"" he remembers with sadness. Dairo, who 
    limps, says he was devastated. Last week, he was still a sad man as 
    he recounted the incident, ""That was a very sad day in my 
    life. I mean it was my dream job and I was set to give it my best 
    shot. If I was disqualified on the basis of incompetence, I would 
    have understood. But here was someone telling me I was unemployable 
    despite my qualification and experience on the field"".
Stella Emeka woke up one morning late last year, bubbling with 
    life. On her schedule was a visit to a bank for transactions. To 
    have a head lead, she was at the gate of the Bank located in Agege, 
    Lagos as early as 8am. But two hours later, she was still outside 
    the banking hall, unable to make withdrawals. ""I watched 
    helplessly as people came and walked in freely while I was denied 
    access because they said the security door will not allow me 
    in"". Sensing she was heading to spending the entire day locked 
    out, Emeka said she created a scene, which attracted top officials 
    of the bank inside. ""We had to reach a compromise that I 
    should be attended to outside in the full glare of everyone since 
    the security door would not allow me inside with my crutches,"" 
    she said. Since then, she said she hates banking with great 
    passion.
Oni, Dairo and Emeka represent 14 million Nigerians believed to 
    be living with one form of disability or the other by a World Bank 
    report. Put differently, not less than 10% of the Nigerian 
    population consists of persons living with disabilities (PWDS). 
    According to the World Health Organisation, persons with 
    disabilities are such ""individuals with physical, sensory, 
    intellectual or mental health impairments that have a significant 
    and long-lasting effect on the individual’s daily life and 
    activities"". For these 14 million Nigerians, living has been 
    anything but pleasant. Asked how it’s been living with disabilities 
    in Nigeria, all of those who spoke with The 
    Nation on Sunday used adjectives such as 
    ""horrible"", ""hellish"", ""terrible"", 
    ""tough"", ""frustrating"", ""killing"" and 
    ""draining"" to describe their experiences.
They agree that the main challenge against them in Nigeria is 
    stigma and discrimination. ""Nigerians see us as ‘abami’ (strange people) 
    who are under divine punishment. They feel that we must have done 
    something to be blind, invalid, walking with crutches and 
    limping,"" Dairo said. He adds that this is why they are 
    discriminated against and treated as objects of scorns. Veronica 
    Okoli who has spinal cord injuries which confined her to a wheel 
    chair narrated her harrowing experiences with commercial vehicle 
    operators. ""Many times, they won’t wait to pick you up and 
    when they do, they expect you to be as fast as the able bodied. 
    Just last week, I was thrown out of a moving vehicle because the 
    conductor was in a hurry"".
At a point, she decided to patronise only cabs for conveniences. 
    ""But it did not get any better because they won’t even wait 
    for you in the first place. When one out of ten waits, he is 
    charging you thrice what he will charge able-bodied passengers. 
    That was a big put-off because they should have charged us less in 
    the first place if they had any milk of human kindness flowing in 
    them."" Dairo, who shunned the temptation to join the millions 
    of blind Nigerians begging for alms on the streets, started 
    producing soaps and insecticides to make a decent living. 
    ""Will you believe that my products were discriminated against 
    in the market? People jeered at me and said ‘what 
    good can a blind man produce’. As a result, I had to 
    start giving free samples to people to test their 
    effectiveness"".
Many Nigerians, they lament, will not even want to have anything 
    to do with them. ""They see us as dispensable beings on the way 
    to hell. They consider us worthless and unable to get anything out 
    of life,"" said Victoria Akanji, an amputee. The impression 
    fuels stigma and discrimination as Nigerians keep them at arm’s 
    length, ostensibly to rot away. A few who lean towards them only 
    consider them as charities and paupers. This irks David Anyaele, 
    executive director of Citizens with Disabilities (CCD). ""We 
    are not asking for alms or handouts but recognition as 
    full-bloodied human beings. People should stop insulting by 
    thinking of us as alms-takers,"" he said frowning. He said PWDS 
    need empathy, not pity, and support, not handouts. Already bugged 
    down by disabilities, stigma and discrimination from fellow 
    Nigerians are killing PWDS much quicker than their conditions, 
    subjecting them to psychologically torture on a daily basis.
Anyaele says it is hurtful that fellow Nigerians consider them 
    as second-class citizens who deserve no recognition or 
    acknowledgment. ""You see it in the way they look at us. For 
    many millions, we are simply burdens who just fill up the space 
    with no economic values. This gets at us in a way we cannot 
    relay"". For example, he said it is painful that able-bodied 
    Nigerians can push PWDS aside during rush for vehicles. ""They 
    won’t even allow us to go in first. Whereas when I travel overseas, 
    people are willing to assist you get whatever you want first before 
    them,"" Anyaele said. This thoughtlessness and disdain for PWDS 
    extend to the provision of public infrastructures, most of which 
    are inaccessible to the disability community in Nigeria.
With this disdain, not all PWDS feel this bad. Aliyu Amusu has 
    only one leg - a victim of childhood disease which he doesn’t know 
    of. Last year, he was part of the team that represented Lagos state 
    to win silver at the Para-Olympic games. At twenty six, he is 
    unemployed. To make ends meet, Aliyu sits on a skateboard which in 
    other climes is for able-bodied people in Agege, Ikeja and its 
    environs in Lagos, darting between pedestrians begging for alms. He 
    presents a scary sight when he zips at top speed in and around 
    cars, trucks motorcycles, and pedestrians during the rush hours. 
    The deft but dangerous moves as he and others who share the same 
    plight would be envy of stunts men. He laughs and grins when told 
    of the implication of his brazen acts, but maybe he sees it as an 
    extension of Para-soccer (soccer for the disabled) skills which he 
    plays. He also does not feel too bothered about his condition. 
    ""Na God makes me like this"", he said. However, he 
    confessed his choice mode of transportation on fast moving 
    skateboards scares him at times. And it should.
Most roads in the nation are without sidewalks, which would have 
    enabled PWDS to walk beside vehicles on roads without the danger of 
    being crushed. Ditto for vehicles, which have no consideration 
    whatsoever for how PWDS will access them. Mohammed Sanni says 
    whenever he boards vehicles, he has to squat since his legs were 
    amputated. ""My son has to practically carry me inside where I 
    only squat instead of sitting properly"". Public places such as 
    libraries, stadia, schools, post offices, hospitals and worship 
    centres are constructed without any thought for PWDS, meaning most 
    of them cannot even access, less alone benefit from them. Dele 
    Bankole recalls with bitterness his inability to attend church 
    service in the last 25years 
    since he started using wheel chairs.
Also, many public buildings in the country do not have 
    facilities for physically challenged people. Even places of worship 
    are plagued with the same challenge. ""I love to serve God but 
    I must confess I have not been in church for 25 years now. How can 
    I go when my wheel chairs cannot even gain access to the church? I 
    have to content myself with staying at home for worships,"" he 
    discloses. Azeez, as he simply called himself, managed to attend a 
    church service not long ago. ""As I made to the altar to give a 
    testimony, I slipped and broke my back. My disability has worsened 
    since then,"" he says. An exception is however the Church of 
    Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. At the church premises in Opebi, 
    Ikeja, Lagos, the Lagos Centre Manager of the Latter Day Saints 
    Employment Resource Services, Victor Onumah said the structures 
    were built with easy mobility of people in mind. Onumah said, 
    ""this is the way all buildings of the church are built."" 
    The Utah-based church ensure all buildings on their premises have 
    gently sloping ramps to make movements of people on 
    wheel chairs a more pleasant 
    experience of entering and exiting. It is also good for the 
    elderly, many of whom might find climbing steps stressful due to 
    suffering arthritis and joint pains.
In public and private schools, blind students have no study aids 
    such as Braille for conducive learning. In hospitals, PWDS can 
    hardly access treatment, especially if they have to use lifts. 
    Broadcast stations have no sign translations for the deaf. Offices 
    and public buildings without ramps remain inaccessible to PWDS. All 
    of these mean inclusive and accessible public places therefore 
    remain a lofty dream for the disability community in Nigeria.
While able-bodied Nigerians simply walk to the polling booths 
    and vote for candidates of their choices, their disabled 
    counterparts have no such luxury. Anyaele, who was amputated by 
    Sierra Leonean rebels during the nation’s civil war, said he has 
    never voted since then. ""My brother, I cannot vote because I 
    cannot thumb-print since I am an amputee,"" he said, shaking 
    his head. Perhaps mindful of this, the Justice Uwais-led committee 
    on electoral reforms recommended in his report under the general 
    recommendations section that ""the national assembly should 
    enact laws appropriate for the protections of persons with 
    disabilities to enable them exercise their rights to vote and be 
    voted for"". The report also in the proportional representation 
    and the under-representation of women and other disadvantaged 
    groups section asked that 2% slot be reserved for PWDS for 
    representation. Both recommendations are yet to be implemented.
At the governmental level, the situation is even worse. As at 
    today, experts say there is no government policy whatsoever geared 
    towards issues affecting the disability community. Prof. 
    Iheanacho Izuka of the department of Special Education and 
    Rehabilitation, University of Jos should know if there is any. He 
    says, ‘I am not sure they have it because I have not seen any. In 
    fact, there is none"". Checks by our correspondent revealed no 
    policy whatsoever exists for PWDS in Nigeria. This means PWDS are 
    left on their own with no governmental direction or support 
    whatsoever. Izuka says such lack of governmental attention for PWDS 
    is as criminal as unacceptable. He disclosed that Nigeria, as a 
    signatory to international treaties and charters, get developmental 
    grants with the understanding that such benefits will be enjoyed by 
    all.
Izuka said, ""The millennium development plan, NEPAD, IFAD 
    say it is a matter of right for all people. When money is given 
    out, it is expected that all stakeholders should benefit, including 
    people with disabilities. Nigeria is under agreements not to 
    discriminate against anybody on the basis of their status so that 
    everybody can be productive. Any act of discrimination, whether by 
    omission or commission, is unacceptable by the charters they 
    signed. The documents are replete with such statements. ""
The special needs expert says it is a shame that Nigeria is 
    lagging behind in designing appropriate mechanisms for PWDS. Izuka 
    said that Nigeria has not even started at all. Nigeria, he said, 
    ""should start with a national disability policy.
""Then we should do sector analysis as it concerns 
    disabilities in all sectors of the nation. If we don’t move, the 
    whole world is moving and leaving us behind. We have a lot to catch 
    up on. Every ministry concerned with the affairs of persons with 
    disabilities must have a sector analysis. There should be needs 
    assessment. Then, policy and objectives, which should be tied to 
    their strategic plans. There must be implementation blueprints, 
    which must be broken down to action plans tied to time frame. Then, 
    they must bring out monitoring and evaluation plans, which will 
    enable them to track for elimination of obsolete ideas and 
    evolution to make what they are doing relevant.""
While PWDS wait for government to get to that state, they say 
    Nigerians should show them empathy, understanding and support. Oni 
    says, ""We need a lot of encouragement. People should know we 
    did not ask for what is upon us. We need more love than money. When 
    love is there, other things will handle themselves. People should 
    support us to live better lives"". For Dairo, ""the first 
    thing Nigerians should not do for us is to pity us. Empathy is 
    better. They should not give us hand-outs or charities but 
    opportunities. We should assess people more on the values they 
    carry, not their physical status. It should be on what they can 
    contribute to the commonwealth. Let us give persons with 
    disabilities access and assistance to infrastructures that will 
    make us perform better.""

NigerianEnglish,should,"Why should such a grave decision be based on the whims of a letter by the Akwa Ibom State Governor asking for a resolution of the boundary dispute between Cross River and Akwa Ibom State , using the historical application",deontic,deontic,deontic,bl_10,"Matters arising on Cross River 76 oil wells
The revolting decision by the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation 
    and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) to unjustly relocate 76 oil wells 
    from Cross River State to Akwa Ibom State leaves tons of gall in 
    its wake. The action is provocative, reactionary, unreasonable 
     unconstitutional and against all reasonable 
    rationalization. Coming a few months soon after the handover of 
    Bakassi to the Republic of Cameroon 
    , it amounts, to every extent, an insult to the agony being 
    suffered by Cross River State over the loss of Bakassi.
The allocation of the oil wells to Akwa Ibom State has resulted 
    in the delisting of Cross River State from the list of 
    oil-producing States. Consequent upon this, the State was credited 
    with a zero allocation from the 13 percent derivation fund 
    exclusive to oil-producing States. This drastic fall in the revenue 
    stream of the State has placed the state on a virtual collapse 
    curve. Not only in terms of meeting its wage bill, a daunting 
    primacy of Government anytime, but also the funding of programmes 
    and projects, including counterpart financial contributions to 
    interventionist programmes and projects by international 
    agencies.
The feeling of anguish by Cross Riverians is captured by the 
    State Governor, Senator Liyel Imoke, who summarized the 
    difficulties and enormous challenges the State has been thrown into 
    as ""dire"". No national institution dare compromise the 
    destiny of a State and its people as the Revenue Mobilization, 
    Allocation and Fiscal Commission, and the National Boundary 
    Commission have done.
In many quarters home and abroad, the criminal allocation of the 
    wells to Akwa Ibom State is viewed as conspiracy between RMAFC, and 
    the NBC. This conspiracy theory is fuelled by the clandestine 
    manner the decision was arrived at by RMAFC and the NBC. The 
    strength of the decision, according to media reports, was rested on 
    a dubious interpretation of a Supreme Court opinion that the 
    littoral status of Cross River State following the ceding of 
    Bakassi to Cameroon cannot be determined, until the international 
    maritime boundary between Nigeria and Cameroon is modified and 
    published, in accordance with the ruling of the International Court 
    of Justice at the Hague.
So the entire episode itself starts from the historical tussle 
    over the ownership of Bakassi. When Cameroon joined issues with 
    Nigeria over the ownership of Bakassi, an oil rich Peninsula on the 
    South East Coast of Nigeria . Both countries opted for the 
    arbitration of the International Court of Justice over the issue. 
    This was after the dispute had led to military skirmishes between 
    the two neighbours and attracted the attention of the international 
    community.
The resource-rich Bakassi Peninsula , and the 1,600 
    kilometre-long border area between Cameroon and Nigeria extending 
    from Lake Chad to the Gulf of Guinea has been a bone of contention 
    between the two countries dating back to 1913. In 1981, both 
    countries almost went to war over the Peninsula , and an area 
    around Lake Chad . Tensions 
    reached fever pitch between the two countries in 1993 and again in 
    1996.
In 1994, Cameroon took the matter to the International Court of 
    Justice (ICJ). The case was intricate and sensitive, requiring the 
    court to re-examine colonial records 100 years back. On October 10, 
    2002 , the ICJ ruled that Bakassi belonged to Cameroon . Against 
    all rational opinion in the country, Nigeria
     , under President Obasanjo 
    accepted the judgment. On June 2006, to the consternation of Cross 
    Riverians, Archibong Town and its environs were handed over to 
    Cameroon . The rest of the 
    disputed territory was ceded to Cameroon on Thursday, 14 August, 
    2008 , an event that brought tears 
    to many.
Against the strategic long term interests of Cross River State
     , the then Governor Donald Duke 
    deferred to the national interest, at the expense of the strategic 
    interest of Cross River State . 
    Some would say he had no choice in the matter. It was strictly a 
    Federal issue. That settled it. But it was critical for a lasting 
    solution to be found to the genuine fears of the state over the 
    relocation of Bakassi inhabitants, and the status of Cross River as 
    an oil-producing state.
This was in effect, the substance of the Green Tree Agreement 
    between Nigeria and Cameroon in 2006. Although a new Bakassi has 
    been provided, the resettlement issue is not yet fully settled. 
    This is in betrayal of guarantees from the international community 
    and Federal authorities that they would protect the corporate 
    interests of Bakassi indigenes and Cross River State
     . The first act of betrayal was 
    the deliberate undermining of the resettlement exercise by Federal 
    authorities through non-release of the requisite funds. Cross River 
    State was virtually left to bear the brunt of the resettlement of 
    Bakassi people alone.
These were great challenges the State was grappling with only 
    for a knife to be put through its underbelly by the RMAFC and NBC, 
    who acting in contempt of the Constitution, the Presidency and 
    Cross River State , fraudulently 
    moved the State’s 76 oil wells to Akwa Ibom State
     . By this abominable act, the 
    RMAFC and NBC have thrown the financial security of Cross River 
    State to the dogs.
This contemptible act has nothing to do with the ceding of 
    Bakassi to the Republic of Cameroon 
    . The oil wells could as well be assigned to Cameroon and 
    not to Akwa Ibom that Bakassi was not ceded to. How did the oil 
    wells end up in Akwa Ibom when it was not even joined in the 
    Bakassi dispute? Where is the Supreme Court judgement that gave the 
    oil wells to Akwa Ibom? For such a fundamental decision, was the 
    Presidency not put on notice even as a matter of courtesy?
The whole thing smacks of a grand conspiracy, a classic 
    financial coup. Why should such a grave decision be based on the 
    whims of a letter by the Akwa Ibom State Governor asking for a 
    resolution of the boundary dispute between Cross River and Akwa 
    Ibom State , using the historical 
    application? In the event, new grounds were applied without the 
    knowledge of the parties, and the oil wells allocated to Akwa Ibom 
    State just like that. What a stupendous gift that was?
The immediate effect of this is the possible crippling of 
    developmental activities in Cross River State. The State’s revenue 
    has dropped from N2.2 billion monthly to about a billion 
    Naira monthly. In the light of the prevailing meltdown, the 
    prospects for the state are bleak indeed. Many people have argued 
    that Cross River should rise up in protest. But fair play demands 
    that the issue be settled politically and peacefully. Cross River 
    State has had an unfair deal in the entire issue. It would seem 
    that the State is being punished for putting national interests 
    ahead of hers. If Bakassi was ceded to Cameroon in the national 
    interest, the oil wells should also be returned to Cross River 
    State in the national interest.
As it is, the matter has acquired a jigsaw puzzle. It is no 
    longer about who is wrong or who is right, and even what is right 
    or what is wrong but about doing the right thing. A lot of 
    Nigerians do agree that the right thing to do is to allow the 
    status quo ante bellum until a delineation of the international 
    maritime boundary between Nigeria and the Republic of Cameroon is 
    determined. Commonsense 
    ought to apply in certain matters. It does not make any sense to 
    give what does not belong to Akwa Ibom State to it. It is morally 
    reprehensible and a flagrant abuse of equity and justice.
This matter brings the fairness and sense of responsibility of 
    our national institutions into question. On a day of reckoning, the 
    RMAFC and the NBC, must explain to Nigerians, how they arrived at 
    such a crazy decision. Between Cross River and Akwa Ibom State
     , there is nothing much to 
    choose. If anything, the two sister States should have the same 
    number of oil wells each. To sit down in a conference table, deal 
    cards under the table, drink Champaign and reach a ridiculous 
    decision on an issue of national interest because of qualified 
    privilege, as the RMAFC and NBC have done is a disservice to 
    Nigeria and Nigerians.

Every year, young, energetic, and vibrant graduates are being 
    pumped out of NYSC in two batches. Many of them travel here and 
    there in search of greener pasture in several multinational 
    companies, private companies, banks etc. but only a few 
    remain lucky after several attempt. Seriously I have always 
    wondered how unemployment can be high in a country like Nigeria 
    where barriers to business have not yet been set up (the 
    politicians haven't had time). But how long will people fold 
    their arms and remain hungry waiting for government to give them 
    jobs? Do we really think government can provide jobs for all? What 
    then will happen to the unlucky ones that will never get a job? 
    That’s what pumps into my mind, so I made up my mind to write on 
    youth empowerment, atleast for 
    four series, because I believe the youth need to be empowered 
    because they are the future of Nigeria and if they fail, the nation 
    would fail. Seriously every time I look on the streets and see the 
    hopelessness on the faces of highly qualified but jobless people 
    eats at my soul.
The truth is that an average young Nigerian has a mentality to 
    go to school, study well then look for a well paying job. Nobody is 
    thinking of how to create a job and that is why there will always 
    be no job for the job seekers. You know it beats me that here it is 
    becoming the norm to find whole families where virtually every 
    member of that family is unemployed, not because they don’t have 
    qualified people in that family but they just can not get 
    employment. I believe there are so many opportunities in this 
    country, once you get out of the mindset of getting jobs or 
    ‘just opening a shop and selling 
    things'. People need to be innovative; seriously 
    we have a lot of entrepreneurial drive in this country, far more 
    than any other sub-Saharan black nation. Let me give you some 
    wisdom now that there is no job, this is an opportunity for you to 
    make some cash. You can create a career school, were people learn 
    some technical stuff, you just have to find a venue, probably a 
    school which you can use in the evening, and find people with 
    skills to teach, and they should be the best in their given field. 
    About money you can get the LGA to sponsor people, or even 
    politician or companies. You never can tell what you can achieve 
    till you start thinking and start acting. Or 
    As a fresh graduate, you can do some menial jobs to get 
    some money for yourself before your NYSC and start up something. 
    You can even make a lot of sacrifices during your service year to 
    be able to make some savings, and if you have the mindset that this 
    country doesn't have anything to offer you on completion of 
    your service, you can then use the little money you were able to 
    save to start up a small business which you know you are good at 
    and if you are focused, I assure you, the top will be your 
    position. And for young 
    entrepneur, this might be an “Expo” 
    The packaging industry in Nigeria is unexplored. Garri packed the 
    same old way, palm oil- you have to take your own bottle along to 
    buy, do you like plantain chips- how is it packaged. The truth is 
    that people will pay abit more for 
    quality especially Nigerians, you know we like style. Remember ice 
    water, over thrown by pure water. The population of Nigeria is over 
    150 million, if you can satisfy 1% of this population and make =N= 
    1 .00 profit from each customer, in a year your business 
    would have made =N=1,000,000.00 profit 
    But you have to Do your research well and think of the market you 
    want to satisfy. Finally Change your orientation towards creating a 
    job no matter how small you start as long as you are focus, within 
    few years you will see yourself at the top. Bishop David Oyedepo 
    started the winners’ chapel with his family as the only

NigerianEnglish,should,The idea of catchment areas should be reviewed even if priorities are going to be made for some groups,deontic,deontic,deontic,ASsc_11,"Staff
A peculiar responsibility of anyone charged with the management 
    of university education in Nigeria or anywhere, for that matter, is 
    the awesome task of managing an enormous pool of human resource. 
    The true quality of a university is determined by the calibre of 
    staff, both academic and non-academic, that it has. The university 
    is a place of learning, of scholarship where the highest standards 
    are expected. At the best of times the staff, especially academic 
    staff, are supposed to be inspired by the greatest ideals of 
    scholarship and conduct. This comes about when they are motivated 
    by the provision of equipment and facilities to work with and when 
    they are paid wages that enable them to concentrate all their 
    energies on teaching and research. Unfortunately, this has not been 
    the situation in Nigeria in the last two decades. The 
    scabrious environment and inadequate salaries have led to 
    the brain-drain syndrome. But a more deadly effect of the situation 
    has been the almost complete breakdown of moral consciousness and 
    adherence to the ideals of the teaching profession. Much of what 
    passes for normal university culture has disappeared and there is a 
    frightening degree of delinquency among staff.
The need to re-direct staff, to coax and cajole them back to the 
    primary vision and mission of the university is one of the grave 
    duties of the manager of university education at this time. The 
    temptation to make quick and easy money by exploiting students has 
    diverted the attention of many academic staff from research. Even 
    in difficult times, our universities must strive to remain at the 
    cutting edge of knowledge, to create and contribute new knowledge. 
    University education should be so managed to ensure that good 
    quality teaching is going on and equipment for research provided. 
    These are the raison d'etre of 
    universities.
To facilitate this attempt to keep in the fore quality research 
    and familiarity with current scholarship, Nigerian universities 
    should take the establishment of linkages and exchange programmes 
    with African and overseas universities seriously. Any university 
    that is out of date is dead. The area of the provision and 
    maintenance of good academic staff desires critical attention as 
    attempts are made to reposition our universities for proper 
    performance. The fact that academics is no longer the first choice 
    of many bright undergraduates and many of the lecturers now are 
    only secondarily interested in teaching and research, should be 
    cause for worry.
The area of the relationship between the staff and the 
    management is delicate and should be the business of the manager. 
    University staff are outspoken, know their rights, are aware of the 
    rules and insist on conscientious welfare packages. While 
    management must ensure that there is discipline and that staff 
    perform their duties, the leadership of the university should run 
    an open administration with which everyone can identify. Some of 
    the tensions that plague our universities result from preferential 
    treatments given to some members of staff where the leadership is 
    unable to be even-handed and fair.
Students
Students represent the largest segment of the university 
    community. They are partly the reason for the establishment of 
    universities and their fortune in the university is part of the 
    litmus test for good management of university education. They are 
    vulnerable, they are the recipients of the education offered in the 
    institutions and their quality partly determines the success or 
    failure of the system. They are also extremely impressionistic, 
    critical and problematic and malleable; good student management is 
    part of the question of the vision of the university. One sad 
    aspect of student management in the campus is the belief among the 
    radical and activist few that students must confront the 
    administration and that the only way they can make their presence 
    felt is by causing crises and disrupting the orderly running of 
    sessions. Good university management would recognise this tendency 
    and devise strategies to repudiate such culture and tradition.
Students seem to suffer the decay in the system in some very 
    special ways, right from when they are admitted into the university 
    to the end of their programmes. For many of them, their first 
    experience of a university during their admission is not of a place 
    inhabited by gods who are upright and decent, but clay-footed and 
    corrupt individuals who extort money from them before they are 
    admitted. No good university management should tolerate this 
    unhealthy situation. Admission scores introduce distortions that 
    must be removed from university education. Some of the violence and 
    frustration the students exhibit in their demonstrations can be 
    traced to the perceived injustice they experience.
In this connection, government's admission policy is faulty 
    and needs to be reviewed. The recent re-definition of catchment 
    areas which officially encourages the concentration of people from 
    certain tribal groups in different universities promotes ethnicity 
    and defeats one of the missions of the university - to promote 
    national unity through a citizenry liberated by education. Many 
    candidates who are prima-facie qualified for 
    admission lose out because they come from outside certain 
    geographical zones. If this policy must be maintained, it will be 
    advisable to increase the percentage reserved for candidates 
    admitted on merit to fifty per cent (50%) of the total number that 
    applied for a particular course and the other prescribed 
    permutations for admission used for the rest. But it is, perhaps, 
    best to loosen the stranglehold of the Joint Admission and 
    Matriculation Board. JAMB should not be involved in admissions 
    per se. The results of the University 
    Matriculation Exams should be a guide to individual universities in 
    making their choice of candidates. And universities may decide to 
    adopt additional steps to ensure that they get the calibre of 
    students they want. Such a step will also save JAMB some of the 
    unsavoury criticisms that have been levelled against it of late, 
    especially the allegation that the performances of some 
    high-scoring candidates in the UME bear absolutely no relationship 
    to the capabilities they demonstrate in class on admission. The 
    idea of catchment areas should be reviewed even if priorities are 
    going to be made for some groups.
A disheartening feature of Nigerian universities and the despair 
    of most managers of our universities in the last two decades has 
    been the high degree of indiscipline among university students. 
    Apart from the fact that students have active and inquiring minds, 
    have high expectations that can be easily disappointed, they are 
    generally impatient, at times irritating and enjoy letting off 
    steam before they realise the amount of damage they have caused. In 
    some cases, they are also instigated by mischievous members of 
    staff and some political forces outside. All these lead to 
    situations of disorder that often cause harm, even death, and the 
    frequent closures of our universities. For the manager of the 
    university, this is one of the most unwelcome experiences because 
    it means the students are out of school for several months and do 
    not get the education they should.
The most harrowing indication of the breakdown of discipline in 
    our unwillingness is the demonic feature of cults and cultism on 
    almost every campus. At the last count, there were more than forty 
    cult groups among both men and women in our university system. And 
    reports show that they have also spread to the secondary schools. 
    Several historical and sociological studies have been made of this 
    menace in attempts to understand and stamp out the evil. Over and 
    above all the brilliant suggestions that have been made, it seems 
    clear to the present writer that the main problem can be located in 
    the breakdown of moral order and the erosion of the essential 
    culture of the university: the pursuit of truth, the sense of right 
    and wrong, adhesion to civilised and decent ways, devotion to 
    scholarship and research at different levels, development of 
    potentials in sports and the arts, community service, interest in 
    mental and spiritual development, and innocent fun. If our 
    universities were seen as communities where certain practices were 
    forbidden by the sheer force of their traditions and were stamped 
    out as soon as they reared their heads - barring interference from 
    outside - cultism would have been contained. The operation of cults 
    on campuses do not provide the right condition for learning. To 
    improve discipline among students, three important steps need to be 
    taken: attention to student welfare, serious counselling of 
    students and a lifting of the moral tone of the universities. 
    Students should be made to understand that as adults they are fully 
    responsible for their action and the law would take its full course 
    in cases of infraction. In this regard one of the worst syndromes 
    that has polluted university education here is the sickness of 
    examination malpractices. They betray not only the moral vacuity of 
    our students and the denigration of the most important aspect of 
    their training but also their lack of confidence in the university. 
    This problem must be eliminated in our universities.
Finally, it is possible that one of the reasons for the 
    persistence of almost identical forms of violence and cultism in 
    our universities to the complete negation of what true university 
    education stands for, is the insularity of our situation. In spite 
    of the explosion in the information market, few of our students 
    seem to know what their counterparts in other parts of the world 
    are doing, their concerns and their view of education for 
    sustainable development. To complement what little our students get 
    from the clamorous, programmes should be devised that enable them 
    travel to other universities outside the country either on short 
    term visits or on exchange programmes. The importance of travel as 
    part of education has always been recognised, and now that our 
    system here seems to have been so polluted, such a tonic will help 
    to rejuvenate and re-direct our university communities as we seek 
    to pull them back from the brink of disaster. In Europe the ERASMUS 
    and SOCRATES groups are popular travel bands of students and the 
    experiences they acquire not only encourage comparison and 
    cross-fertilisation of ideas but lead to richer personal 
    development.
The Unions
The revolutions in labour relation matters of the seventies and 
    eighties impacted significantly on the nation's universities. 
    Hitherto, full-blown unionism was anathema to the universities. 
    However, with the new trend in the country and in the spirit of 
    democracy, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) was 
    granted the full status of a trade union to protect the interest of 
    academic staff of Nigerian universities. Thereafter, the 
    non-academic staff also organised themselves into the Senior Staff 
    Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic 
    Staff Union (NASU) as pressure groups in the university. The 
    students have always had the National Association of Nigerian 
    Students (NANS) and students unions in individual universities. 
    These local unions have now been elevated to the status of 
    governments and prefer to be known as Student Union Government 
    (SUG). The striking point about the existence of these staff unions 
    on campus is that they are national bodies only represented by 
    chapters in the various universities. The implication of this 
    structure is that the unions owe their allegiance elsewhere outside 
    their parent universities. University administrations have to 
    contend with the harrowing pressures from the local branches and 
    directives from the national headquarters of the various unions.
This thumb-nail account of the unions on our university campus 
    immediately alerts any reader to the nightmare which their various 
    demands and activities constitute to the university management. 
    Indeed, Vice-Chancellors are the only Chief Executive Officers who 
    have to contend with such a large number of labour unions in any 
    organisation. The ability of a Vice-Chancellor to manage his 
    unions, assuage their intemperance, keep his university open 
    throughout the session and provide a peaceful learning environment 
    is certainly an index of his leadership ability and determination 
    that our universities should concentrate on their primary 
    assignments of teaching and research. The unions' protest area 
    cover a wide range of perceived grievances; some serious, others 
    trivial and still others plainly mischievous. Some of the unions 
    have become tools in the hands of disreputable staff union leaders 
    who merely use them to create problems for the administration.

NigerianEnglish,should,"State Ministries of Education should be responsible for Special Education programmes in their states, this is to include planning, supervision, and finance (FME circular, 1976)",deontic,deontic,deontic,Adm_03,"Special Education Policies in Nigeria
The genesis of special education 
    -the modification of regular education to enable the 
    handicapped to derive benefit from it - could be traced to the 
    establishment of the first school for the blind in Kano by the 
    Sudan Interior Mission (SIM) in the early forties. Between 1953 and 
    the outbreak of the Nigeria Civil War, more schools for the 
    handicapped, particularly those for the visually handicapped, the 
    hearing impaired and the mentally retarded, were established in 
    different parts of the country. This first generations of 
    institutions for the handicapped, according to Obani (1989), were 
    largely the result of efforts of dedicated Christians propelled by 
    missionary zeal. They charted the course of special education and 
    recorded modest successes with the 
    meagerresources and the small subventions from the federal 
    and regional governments. Their devotion, indefatigable spirit and 
    tenacity of purpose, largely compensated for the poor funding and 
    inadequacy of equipment. The role of the government was minimal 
    during this phase of development. There was no clear-cut policy of 
    government except, a few terse provision of dormant legislations in 
    some parts of the country (Obani, 1989). The education of the 
    handicapped according to Obani was treated as a welfare service 
    rather than a national investment and as a 
    priviledge rather than a duty 
    for government.
With the end of the civil war in 1970 came the oil boom and the 
    second phase of development of education for the handicapped. The 
    government started to play an increasing role in the special 
    education sector. This resulted in the establishment of many 
    schools for the handicapped in all the states of the federation, 
    but many without proper planning and adequate staffing. Moreover, 
    departments for the training of special educators were established 
    in both Ibadan and Jos universities. The Federal College for 
    special education was also established.
Another important phenomenon of this phase is the enunciation of 
    a definite policy on special education contained in Section 8 of 
    the National Policy on Education (1977), revised in (1981).
In this section, the purpose of special education is clearly 
    stated and this includes the provision of adequate education for 
    all handicapped children and adults so that they can contribute to 
    national development (para. 55 b), the policy also 
    identifies integration as the most realistic form of special 
    education since handicapped children are eventually expected to 
    live in the society (para. 56(5).
The Philosophy of Special Education
The National Policy on Education has these as the purpose and 
    objectives of special education:
(a) To give concrete meaning to the ideas of equalising 
    educational opportunities for all children, their physical, mental, 
    emotional disabilities not-withstanding.
(b) To provide adequate education for all handicapped children 
    and adults in order that they may fully play their roles in the 
    development of the nation.
(c) To provide opportunities for exceptionally gifted children 
    to develop at their own pace in the interest of the nation's 
    economic and technological development.
Section 8 of the policy highlighted governments intention in 
    this form:
(1) Sub section 56 (1) the Federal Government will set up a 
    committee to co-ordinate Special Education activities in 
    collaboration with the Ministries of Health, Social Welfare and 
    Labour.
(2) A census will be taken of all handicapped children and 
    adults by age, sex, locality and type.
(3) The government accepts the responsibility for making 
    provision for training teachers in Special Education as well as the 
    supportive staff required by the school, colleges, clinics and 
    centres in this area.
(4) The government has decided that integration is the most 
    realistic form of Special Education, since handicapped children are 
    eventually expected to live in the society.
(5) The education of the handicapped will be free at all levels, 
    up to the University level where possible.
(6) Vocational schools will be made to reserve places for 
    further education of handicapped children and adults - government 
    will provide suitable employment opportunities for the handicapped 
    workers.
(7) Children clinic will be attached to most hospitals for early 
    identification of the handicapped children, and for curative 
    measures and medical care before and after the age of primary 
    schooling.
(8) Ministries of Health, Education, Social Welfare, Social 
    Development and Labour will work jointly on most programmes for 
    handicapped children, and the National Council on Special Education 
    will be composed to reflect this collective responsibility.
Strengths of the Policy
There is no doubt that this policy which has identified central 
    issues in special education has some strengths.
1. The National Policy on Education (NPE) represents the most 
    comprehensive and most far-reaching education policy ever devised 
    in Nigeria. This view finds support from Thakur (1983), Nwaogu 
    (1988), Osokoya (1989) and Nkangwung (1994). Thakur (1983), for 
    instance, described it as the first comprehensive document produced 
    since the beginning of the Western type of schooling in Nigeria. 
    Education policies before now, as Nkangwung (1994) puts it, had 
    limited concern geographically and in the programmes. Unlike the 
    previous policies, this new policy was developed in Nigeria by 
    Nigerians to cater for the needs of Nigerians.
2. It also represents an articulation between education and 
    national objectives. The policy sees education as a means for 
    achieving national objectives which are identified as the building 
    of:
• a free and democratic society
• a just and egalitarian society
• a united, strong and self-reliant nation
• a great and dynamic economy
• a land of bright and full opportunities
for all citizens (NPE, 1981). Both in concept and design, this 
    new system can be seen as a radical departure from the former 
    British implemented education system in Nigeria which was guided by 
    the imperial utilitarian considerations (Osokoya, 1989).
3. Education is seen as a right of the citizen not a 
    priviledge of the few.
4. Also noteworthy about the policy is the fact that we have for 
    the first time in Nigeria an education policy and practice that are 
    based on a definite social philosophy. This is important because 
    the planning for an appropriate education of any society should be 
    done in relation to the social ideals - philosophy of the society 
    in question (Nkangwung, 1994).
5. Another strength of the policy and perhaps the most relevant 
    for the purpose of this paper, is its provision for the education 
    of exceptional children. The purpose and objectives of special 
    education are clearly stated in Section 8 (55) while Section 8 (56) 
    specifies the ways and means by which the government intends to 
    achieve the stated objectives. Nwaogu (1988) also reported that the 
    National Policy on Education envisages that:
(a) Special Education will lead to early detection of students 
    with learning problems.
(b) Identification will lead to early intervention.
(c) It will help to provide adequate knowledge of a child's 
    characteristics, aptitudes, interests, strength and weaknesses and 
    ensure adaptation of materials and programme to the benefit of the 
    student.
(d) The intervention may focus on remedial or compensatory 
    education.
(e) Knowledge about the causes of handicapped conditions and 
    their attendant learning problems will help bring about changes in 
    people's attitudes that are rooted in ignorance and 
    superstition.
(f) The use of individualized instruction methods will ensure 
    proper selection of materials, assessment criteria evaluation and 
    grading.
(g) Teachers to be produced for Special Education are those who 
    have vision, who are responsive, perceptive, alert and thorough in 
    their duties towards children.
Weaknesses of the Policy
1. The aims of education are not consistent at all levels of 
    education, for example, national integration is an aim of education 
    only at the secondary level.
2. There is too much presence of government in the policy with 
    the result that private initiative is stifled.
3. Another inconsistency in the policy is the area of support or 
    control of education. At the pre-primary level, the policy allows 
    for private participation while the primary level largely enjoys 
    public control. The control at the secondary level is both private 
    and public but at the tertiary level only public participation is 
    allowed. If there is value in private participation in education, 
    it should run through all levels of education (Adedoja and 
    Ajobiewe, 1996).
4. The policy has taken more than the Nigerian government can 
    achieve. It has gone beyond the enunciation of policy statements to 
    embrace the details that only practitioners could work out 
    (Nkangwung, 1994).
Implementation - Main Issues
It is apparent that Section 8 provides the directional policies 
    of special education in Nigeria. It is a well-intended policy which 
    has not been pragmatically pursued (Obiakor, Maltby and Ihunnah, 
    1990). Recent studies by Ihunnah (1984) and Oluigbo (1985) have 
    made salient revelations. Ihunnah (1984) for instance, used a 
    survey research design methodology to study improvements in special 
    education facilities, enrolment, and manpower in Nigeria. His 
    discoveries included the following:
• There has been an increase in the number of qualified teaching 
    personnel in special education. Student's enrolment is not 
    commensurate with teacher preparation.
• Established mechanisms for policy implementation are not 
    consistently enforced.
• There is a lack of specialised consultants and qualified 
    educational planners in strategic areas etc.
Co-ordination
In 1976, the Federal Ministry of Education gave the following 
    provisional guidelines to states: State Ministries of Education 
    should be responsible for Special Education programmes in their 
    states, this is to include planning, supervision, and finance (FME 
    circular, 1976). However, there is no record to show that the 
    committee has been formed. The implication is that programmes for 
    the disabled in Nigeria remain uncoordinated. (Adedoja & 
    Ajobiewe, 1996).
Census
Another important clause in the National Policy concerns the 
    need for a census of all handicapped children and adults and the 
    attaching of children's clinics to most hospitals for early 
    identification of handicapped children, and the provision of 
    curative measures and medical care. The 1991 census figure revealed 
    that Nigeria has a population of 88.5 million. Using the 
    United Nations projection of one in every ten persons in a 
    population to be disabled, it is estimated that there are 8.8 million disabled Nigerians. However, there is no breaking of 
    this figure to each category of the handicapped. A critical 
    examination of the policy revealed that there was no structured 
    programmes or provision for the early detention of handicaps in 
    Nigerian children, and although some routine health programmes do 
    identify and refer a few cases, there was a general lack of special 
    facilities and personnel for early detection and treatment of 
    individuals with handicap. As regards the children's clinics, 
    only very few isolated cases were recorded. Some supportive 
    services to the handicapped and their families are available 
    through child guidance clinics in few states, e.g. 
    Lagos State. These are obviously inadequate.
Integration issue
Despite the laudable intentions expressed nearly two decades 
    ago, integration of exceptional children cannot be said to have 
    achieved any considerable success in Nigeria. The apparent failure 
    of integration, as Nkangwung (1994) puts it, has affected special 
    education adversely. According to the author, not only has it 
    deprived our special children, especially in the rural areas who 
    have no access to the few special school located mainly in the 
    cities, the opportunity and the advantages derivable from 
    integration. It is better that the handicapped children are not 
    uprooted from their homes, families and communities. The government 
    should do much more to encourage integration schemes; it is 
    essential that they take root and flourish if the vast majority of 
    Nigeria's handicapped children are to receive any 
    education.

NigerianEnglish,should,There should be no attempt to re-open the case or start analysis after the delivery of concluding statements on this matter,deontic,deontic,deontic,ed_14,"Ilorin 49, the judiciary, and the academy
Ropo Sekoni commends the Supreme Court judgment on the Ilorin 
    university lecturers
The recent Supreme Court decision on five of the famous Ilorin 
    49 has once again demonstrated that Nigerians at all socioeconomic 
    levels believe in the role of knowledge in the construction of 
    modern society and in the role of the judiciary in stabilizing 
    modern societies. Formal and folk media have been overflowing with 
    expression of congratulations for the judiciary and the 49 workers 
    in the nation’s vineyard of knowledge production. The Supreme Court 
    that has recently been acquiring the status of savior of the 
    country’s democracy on account of a few restoration of the mandate 
    of some governors is also believed by many to have recently added 
    another laurel. The judiciary is also now being seen as the 
    defender of academic freedom and the right of academics to use 
    strike as a legitimate way of expressing grievances to their 
    employers, be they private owners of capital or governments. In 
    addition, the positive reaction of the attorney-general to the 
    judgment is encouraging, even though superfluous. But more 
    superfluous is the statement from the University of Ilorin 
    administration on the judgment.
It is surprising that government officials think they need to 
    assure the nation about their intention to support a court 
    decision, more so a decision of the Supreme Court. In the context 
    of separation of powers that Nigeria finds itself, it is expected 
    that government officials, particularly the attorney-general should 
    have no reason to assure Nigerians that they would support the 
    decision of the nation’s highest court. support of courts’ 
    decisions by every level of government and every government 
    official, like that of private citizens, should be automatic. To 
    say that the government is in support of court decision is to give 
    the impression that it has a choice not to do so. Even if President 
    Yar’Adua had not started his regime by announcing an abiding 
    commitment to the rule of law, it still would have been wrong for 
    the attorney-general or anyone in government to refuse to implement 
    the decision of the court. It is the job of those in the executive 
    and legislative branches of government to accept and implement the 
    verdict of the courts.
While the Minister of Justice’s statement ""If the 
    Supreme Court gives a judgment, that is the position of the law. 
    And this government has never disobeyed the Supreme Court. We will 
    comply with the apex court. . . . I have already left instructions 
    for the Solicitor-General of the Federation to get a copy of the 
    judgment on Monday and write the University of Ilorin immediately 
    to comply with the judgment"" is not an offensive 
    thing to say. However, one wonders if this assurance is necessary 
    in a truly democratic context. The reporter’s question to the 
    attorney-general surely gives him a good opportunity to reaffirm 
    the rule-of-law credentials of his government. Ordinarily, nothing 
    is wrong with giving a politician an opportunity to campaign for 
    his party. But the average reader of newspapers is likely to be 
    confused by the attorney-general’s need to urge the University of 
    Ilorin to comply with the judgment. Does the institution have a 
    choice over the matter in a democracy?
When the executive branch failed to accept the decision of the 
    judiciary during the regime of General Obasanjo, Nigerians drew 
    attention to the irregularity of such behavior in a democracy. For 
    example, When General Obasanjo refused to carry out the directives 
    of the court on payment of the funds due to local governments in 
    Lagos State, Nigerians complained bitterly and called Obasanjo a 
    dictator and an enemy of democracy. Even Obasanjo’s 
    attorney-general who appeared to share Obasanjo’s view of the 
    superiority of the executive to the judicial branch got some flaks 
    from his fellow members of the bar, as well as from the citizenry. 
    In other words, it is not a sign of political strength for anybody 
    in the executive to give the impression that he or she is doing 
    anything special by his or her acceptance of judicial 
    interpretations and decisions. It is, constitutionally, the job of 
    the judiciary to interpret the law of the land and the duty of the 
    executive and all agencies of government to accept such 
    interpretations.
More worrisome is the reaction from the University of Ilorin. 
    According to media reports, one of the institution’s deputy vice 
    chancellors seized the opportunity of reacting to the judgment of 
    the Supreme Court to rehash the story of the problem that led to 
    the case itself. Let us hear from the deputy vice chancellor in 
    charge of management services: ""As an institution, we 
    believe in the rule of law. The Supreme Court has delivered its 
    judgment. We believe in the rule of law and we will obey, . . . 
    Judgment is one thing but the truth of the matter is cause and 
    effect in nature. People who have forgotten what caused the problem 
    are now making pontifications about the case in the 
    media.""
Agonism or conflict that is the driving force for tragic drama 
    is finding its way to news writing. Otherwise, there would have 
    been no reason for the deputy vice chancellor to re-open the case, 
    accuse the media of bias against the institution, and blame 
    citizens for pontificating. The question that would have helped the 
    University of Ilorin to look ahead on this matter is to find out 
    what difficulties the institution envisages in implementing 
    re-instatement of the five lecturers and payment of salary arrears 
    for nine years, not whether the university will accept the 
    judgment. The University does not appear to have any choice in the 
    matter. It is expected to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision 
    and should not have needed any prodding from the Minister of 
    Justice.
The point of this writer’s complaint is about the danger of 
    information overload for young children being socialized into 
    modern society. In the way questions are posed by the media or are 
    answered by public servants, we may unintentionally be sending 
    wrong signals to children being socialized into the culture of 
    democracy. To ask the attorney-general and the deputy vice 
    chancellor their position on the verdict of the Supreme Court is to 
    use impunity as the cultural default. We need to use the rule of 
    law as the default in post- military and post-Obasanjo Nigeria.
The academy also appears to be under the undue influence of the 
    agonistic aspect of Nigerian politics. If it was not, there would 
    have been no Ilorin 49 in the first instance, but the post-Obasanjo 
    era should call for a new sensibility on the part of all agents of 
    socialization: the media, government ministers, and institutional 
    leaders. In the academy, the dominant culture does not encourage 
    analysis after conclusion and recommendation. The Supreme Court’s 
    verdict constitutes conclusion and recommendation on the issue of 
    five out of the Unilorin 49. There should be no attempt to re-open 
    the case or start analysis after the delivery of concluding 
    statements on this matter.
A judgment is a settlement of conflict. What is needed now is, 
    while waiting for similar verdict on Ilorin 44, how to make sure 
    that the University of Ilorin is financially and psychologically 
    pre-disposed to carry out the orders of the Supreme Court, not to 
    re-open old wounds.

NigerianEnglish,should,""" By enough sleep, the Nigerian doctor said, ""Actually, the number of hours that will benefit an individual, healthwise, should not be less than eight hours",deontic,deontic,deontic,PSsc_04,"Can insufficient sleep affect work productivity?
Mr John Akorede Abudu was a man who has a special skill at his 
    work place. Everybody respected him. With time, he got promoted and 
    moved into his house. Initially, he lived close to his workplace 
    because his house was in a traffic-laden area. He spent more than 
    three hours to get to work everyday, and another three hours or 
    more to get back home. Suddenly, his productivity at work changed. 
    He could not perform as much as possible. Sometimes, he even slept 
    off during working hours.
Employees are paying a high price for too little sleep when it 
    comes to work productivity, according to new statistics from the 
    Better Sleep Council (BSC). Respondents to the BSC’s 2007 Better 
    Sleep Month survey, conducted for Better Sleep Month this May, 
    reported an alarming decline in quality of work, poor judgment and 
    trouble retaining information as the top work-related consequences 
    from lack of sleep. In fact, 44 per cent said they were likely to 
    be in an unpleasant or unfriendly mood— all bad news for employers, 
    employees and customers.
Dr. Momoh Idris, a medical practitioner at Fulbert 
    Clinic, Ketu, Lagos, said that there is a link between sleep and 
    work productivity. ""Sleep, medically, is a state of rest for 
    the mind and the entire body. So, when an individual is not having 
    enough sleep, it is believed that it could affect work 
    productivity.""
By enough sleep, the Nigerian doctor said, ""Actually, the 
    number of hours that will benefit an individual, healthwise, should 
    not be less than eight hours. An individual can decide to sleep for 
    two hours during the day, and six during the night. With eight 
    hours sleep, it is considered to be sufficient for the body and 
    mind.""
To be realistic, not everybody can achieve eight hours sleep. 
    Idris mentioned factors that could serve as impediments to the 
    prescribed period of sleep, ""There are several factors, such 
    as sudden occurrence, happiness, and unpleasant situations. A 
    person who is too happy, who just heard good news that is 
    mind-blowing, may not be able to sleep. As regards an unpleasant 
    situation, if a beloved person dies, over-thinking, and fatigue 
    (tiredness) may be some of the things that will happen.""
Many will ask the question, ‘What has sleep got to 
    do with work performance’, ""Some believe 
    you can accomplish more if you spend less time sleeping, but 
    limited sleep can affect every aspect of your life, including job 
    performance,"" said Dr. Bert Jacobson, Better 
    Sleep Month spokesperson and author of the new study 
    Subjective Rating of Perceived Back Pain, Stiffness and 
    Sleep Quality Following Introduction of Medium-Firm Bedding 
    Systems. ""In fact, sleep deprivation impacts 
    your level of alertness, your productivity and your ability to 
    socially interact with colleagues.""
In his contribution, Idris said, ""Sleep has many things to 
    do with work performance. When an individual has sufficient sleep, 
    the entire system of the body, will regain the energy it used 
    during the day.
""When you over-stress the system, in the next day, you may 
    be at work, feeling dull, weak, and unable to do as much as you are 
    expected to do at work. So, when all those things come on board, it 
    may make the working productivity very low.""
Studies estimate that sleep deprivation currently costs U.S. businesses nearly $150 billion annually in absenteeism 
    and lost productivity. And Better Sleep Month survey respondents 
    reported sleep deprivation impaired their quality and accuracy of 
    work (31 per cent), clear thinking or judgment (31 per cent) and 
    memory of important details (30 per cent).
Survey results also revealed that tired employees are turning 
    instead to quick-fix performance enhancers to remedy their sleep 
    deficiency problem, including:
•Drinking coffee or other caffeinated drinks (33 per cent)
•Taking a nap (17 per cent)
•Going outside for fresh air (18 per cent)
Many will wonder if there is anything that can be done in order 
    to obey the call of nature. The general practitioner said: 
    ""Obey the sleep pattern. Every individual has his/her sleep 
    pattern. Some will go to bed very early, while some will go to bed 
    very late. If you are the type that ought to have gone to bed 
    8:.00p.m, make sure you are in bed by that time. But, 
    if you are the type who go to bed very late and you have adjusted 
    your system to that, then, sleep late, but not too late, so that, 
    you will have a sound sleep.
""Meanwhile, apart from those ones, it is better to avoid 
    some foods that can make you not to sleep. Study yourself, so that 
    you will know the food you can eat that can make you sleep soundly. 
    Some people testifified to the fact that, if they take certain 
    foods in the night, it will make them to sleep very well.
""Some people believe in having a bath before going to bed. 
    Others believe in reading, some others watch the television till 
    they close their eyes,"" he further said, adding, ""If all 
    that has been mentioned is put in place, sleeping for eight hours 
    should not be a problem.""
Generally, people will say, ‘it is better said 
    than done’. Reason being that, in Lagos, as well as 
    in some other major cities in the country, there is bound to be 
    traffic inhibitions. So, people wake up as early as 3:.00am 
    or 4:.00am to prepare for the day’s job. By 5:.00am, 
    they are on the way to their workplace. They may not leave the 
    office until 6:.00pm. The heavy traffic they will face before 
    getting to their houses will make them get home by 10:.00pm 
    or 11:.00p.m. The question is, how such people can sleep for 
    eight hours, so that their performance at work will not be 
    affected. Idris said, ""It is very hard for such people to make 
    that eight hours. That is the why there is low productivity in many 
    organizations. They cannot meet up with the required sleeping 
    period. The energy they have exhausted during the day has not been 
    fully regained overnight.
""What can be done is that, they have to find a way of 
    compensating for it during the day. If possible, they have to be 
    given some time, no matter how little, to rest, during the 
    day.""
Concerning an advice that can be given to people generally, he 
    said, ""Some people know their status, but they tend to disturb 
    it by making calls at night, for instance, people now believe in 
    using easy talk and extra 
    cool. All those ones are eating up their time of which 
    during the day, will even add to the stress. I will advise the 
    young ones and even the old ones too, to either reduce night calls 
    or avoid them totally."" But, can people really avoid the act, 
    going by the increasing level of poverty that is sneaking into 
    people’s homes, especially those who cannot have a balanced diet of 
    three meals per day, not to talk of a reasonable amount of money on 
    their phones?
He further said, ""If you know you are the type that, once 
    you have observed your status, make sure you stick to it. Avoid 
    food that can get your abdomen irritated and unsettled.""
Only 13 per cent of people, even across the world, are 
    willing to make the commitment to getting more sleep in order to 
    stay awake the more and productive at work.
